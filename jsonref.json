According to the statement released by the committee yesterday, investigators are seeking Jones’ testimony about his alleged involvement in the planning of the January 6 rally that culminated in the Capitol attack.While people are expected to again travel at levels similar to a pre-pandemic Thanksgiving, airlines are still contending with staffing shortages, which could lead to additional flight cancelations. “It doesn’t really matter if a travel disruption is coming from a lack of staffing or shortage of routes or weather, it’s still something that is very frustrating for customers,” said Lindsey Roeschke, travel and hospitality analyst for the Morning Consult, a market research firm. Over the Halloween weekend, American Airlines canceled more than 2,000 flights because of weather and staffing issues.  In letters to employees, David Seymour, chief operating officer of the airline, described the weekend as a “brief irregular ops period” and said that “on the schedule front, we’ve ensured that November and December are built to meet customer demand and that they are fully supportable by our staffing”. The rule requires those working at companies with 100 or more employees to get vaccinated or receive weekly coronavirus tests to mitigate the spread of the virus. It was set to go into effect on January 4. Speaking at yesterday’s briefing, press secretary Jen Psaki noted the Biden administration is using a variety of tools to address high gas prices. Last week, Joe Biden sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission asking the agency to investigate “mounting evidence of anti- consumer behavior by oil and gas companies”. “We will continue to press oil companies who have made record profits and are overseeing what we consider to be price gouging out there,” Psaki said aboard Air Force One yesterday. “When there’s a supply of oil or the price of oil is coming down and the price of gas is not coming down, it does not take an economic expert to know that’s a problem.”The Senate is currently split 50-50, but Democrats control the chamber because of Vice-President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote. So Republicans only need to flip one Senate seat in next year’s midterm elections to regain control of the upper chamber.House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said in a statement, “Today’s announcement – which will release just three days’ worth of oil onto the market – is not about a real solution to our energy crisis. It is a crass political ploy just ahead of Thanksgiving.” Former president Donald Trump similarly criticized Biden’s decision, saying, “Those reserves are meant to be used for serious emergencies, like war, and nothing else.”The president said on Twitter that the action “will be taken in parallel with other major energy consuming nations including China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom”. “As we come out of an unprecedented global economic shutdown, oil supply has not kept up with demand, forcing working families and businesses to pay the price,” energy secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.  “This action underscores the President’s commitment to using the tools available to bring down costs for working families and to continue our economic recovery.”  Read more about the announcement here: However, there are lingering concerns about how the high rate of inflation may impact the negotiations over the bill in the evenly ided Senate. Senator Joe Manchin, one of the key holdouts in Democrats’ negotiations over the bill, has said he is hearing more from constituents who are concerned about their gas and grocery bills. “By all accounts, the threat posed by record inflation to the American people is not ‘transitory’ and is instead getting worse,” Manchin said earlier this month. “From the grocery store to the gas pump, Americans know the inflation tax is real and DC can no longer ignore the economic pain Americans feel every day.” Manchin has previously expressed concern that Democrats’ spending package, known as the Build Back Better Act, could negatively contribute to inflation.  In a September op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Manchin warned against approving more government spending, saying, “An overheating economy has imposed a costly ‘inflation tax’ on every middle- and working-class American.” However, since that op-ed was written, the cost of the package has been cut in half -- from $3.5tn to $1.75tn. And a number of economists have said the bill will not add to inflationary pressure. Biden is hoping those arguments will be enough to make Manchin a “yes” vote, as he will need all 50 Democratic senators’ support to get the bill through the upper chamber. Jerome Powell, who has been nominated to a second term as the chair of the Fed board, said yesterday, “We know that high inflation takes a toll on families, especially those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing and transportation.” Powell, who was first nominated by Donald Trump, said he would use the tools of the central bank “to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched”. Dr Lael Brainard, Biden’s nominee for vice-chair of the board, echoed that message, saying, “I’m committed to putting working Americans at the center of my work at the Federal Reserve. This means getting inflation down at a time when people are focused on their jobs and how far their paychecks will go.”Joe Biden will deliver a speech this afternoon on the state of the US economy and the need to lower prices for American families. Biden has pledged to tackle the issue, arguing that Democrats’ $1.75tn social spending package will lower families’ costs for healthcare and childcare. Speaking at an event yesterday to announce his nominations for the Federal Reserve board, Biden said, “Because so much of the rest of our economy is doing well, because we have created so many new jobs as fast as we have, we’re in a position to attack inflation from a position of strength, not weakness.” But if Americans don’t start to see prices come down soon, it could make it all the more difficult to enact Biden’s agenda.

Those same expectations cannot be met forever. Illustration: iStock‘The ability to find quick and clever ways to overcome difficulties.” “Being able to deal creatively and effectively with problems.” “The quality of being good at finding ways of solving problems.” These are just some of the ways of defining the “something” our students are lacking: resourcefulness. After three decades of teaching I find students are less resourceful now than they have ever been. Covid’s role in this is limited, so let’s park that chestnut and look at the bigger – and more worrying – picture, the picture that both predates Covid and will also long outlive it.How we provide for students with special educational needs sends a message to all our students. They can be hawk-eyed when it suits them and they absorb every detail of how work is set, distributed, differentiated and adapted. They acquire ways of responding to the challenges they meet. Just the thing for students on the lookout for opportunities to offload work they find onerous.At their age, being fully informed of all the details is irrelevant – what they see is that Billy or Bob gets an “easier” option, and they simply want that too. As adults,\u0026nbspit is our job to ensure that all adjustments and accommodations are granted in accordance with the guidelines, and that each student is offered their own best shot at optimal learning and maximum achievement.Across the board in Irish education, policies are very clear on our responsibility as teachers to provide for and accommodate all of the students in our care, whatever their particular needs.Nothing less would make sense, and yet once class size, teacher to pupil ratio and the number of teaching hours per week are factored in, we must question how effectively any teacher can deliver this for every single student.The goals and targets set for those with special educational needs will of course be adapted, and appropriately qualified additional teachers will be allocated time with those students. This in itself creates extra demands on teachers. Communication between the mainstream and special education teachers requires time, which is a good deal harder to come by in our profession than anyone outside it realises.What if the increased demand on adults as a result of resource provision means the student is ultimately less rather than more resourceful? What if we risk conveying the message that we can outsource our challenges?With this in mind what we communicate to our students – all of them – about how to respond to challenges urgently needs reassessing. Current policies lack emphasis on the student’s own role and responsibility towards learning.Parental guidance and support is crucial to youngsters, and provision needs to be made in policies for how parents can consciously engage in dialogue with their children about learning.Much of this work involves students recognising when they are working at their peak so that they can develop a hunger for it. Experiencing the delight that comes with rewards and success is what helps them along the way. This is how we allow them the time and space required to navigate their own path to a very particular sweet spot in the learning experience: the feeling of real achievement. The kind that involves bumps in the road and a need to overcome obstacles. Exactly the kind of experience which I believe many students are denied. It is all too easy for them to get off to a poor start in a subject and then write it off forever. Appropriately scaffolded work combined with the right doses of motivation works wonders and can lead a student down a very different road. Making it about what they already know and have already accomplished is vital. If we only focus on the gaps we nourish self-doubt, and the student’s inner self-saboteur soon takes centre stage. And with that their capacity to be resourceful dwindles rapidly.A student who gets the message that they need to be relieved of a particular learning burden will inevitably relax the corresponding learning muscle. Right now, based on what our current system values, decisions are taken to avoid unnecessarily overloading or discouraging the student.When we value academic performance above and beyond all else, we have no choice but to protect a student from inevitable failure. Essentially, that is what we do when we lower the bar and make allowances. I’m not against this in principle, but what concerns me is that those allowances will not necessarily be made throughout their lives.We create certain expectations in our students when we adjust what is required of them. Those same expectations cannot be met forever, and for that reason I would argue that we would better serve our students by making fewer allowances, especially in the early years. Let’s think bigger and outside the box, and place the emphasis in such a way that pupils experience learning without pressure for longer. We could leave them free to develop a broader range of learning muscles before putting any of them to the test. We could monitor more, and report less.Young people imitate what they see. They model their behaviour on that of others. What we make possible for them and what we ourselves do are both influential here. We who are in roles that youngsters observe need to ensure that they recognise challenges as the massive opportunities they so often are. It is important to convey the language of motivation and excitement rather than discouragement and anxiety. This is what leads young people towards finding new ways and being creative. They get to exercise their problem-solving muscle and learn as they go.Resourcefulness is most definitely an inside job, so let’s not encourage our students to outsource it."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"government approves nomination of ger deering to role of ombudsman","story":"The Government has approved the recommended nomination of Ger Deering to the position of Ombudsman and Information Commissioner.

File photograph: Gareth Chaney Collins PhotosThere weere 3,666 new covid cases confirmed by the Deparatment of Health on Tuesday with 638 patients in hispital of whom 130 are in ICU. There will be no new Covid restrictions recommended to Government this week, the chief medical officer (CMO) has said. It is understood Dr Tony Holohan told opposition health spokespersons that the National Public Health Emergency Team is unlikely to recommend further measures following its meeting this week. Sources at the meeting said the CMO said he is not expecting to recommend additional restrictions following its meeting on Thursday. Instead the focus will be on evaluating the existing measures. Dr Holohan told the group while he is hopeful, there can be no guarantees given the current trajectory of the disease.It is understood he said it was very likely that a further extension of the booster jabs will be recommended. He also said antigen testing has a role to play. And expressed optimism about new anti-viral medications which are showing strong results with up to 50 per cent reduction in hospitalisations. However they’re unlikely to be available for use here until the end of January next year.Waiting listsMeanwhle the HSE’s chief operations officer has warned that cancelled procedures and a policy of not scheduling appointments because of Covid-19 will mean that waiting lists will get longer.Anne O’Connor said procedures were not being scheduled, but the situation had not yet reached the point where all non-Covid procedures were being cancelled, as has had happened during the worst phase of the pandemic.There are currently 638 people being treated in hospital with Covid-19, 130 in ICU, of whom 78 are invasively ventilated, said Ms O’Connor.Hospital directors would review their situations day by day, Ms O’Connor said. They would continue to do that and make decisions based on what their inidual hospital could manage and if necessary to moderate their activity.RestrictionsEarlier, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan played down the prospect of an early return to Covid-19 restrictions, saying he wants to see the impact of people restricting their socialising before further decisions are made. The Minister for the Environment referred to last week’s Government decision to bring in a midnight curfew for restaurants, pubs and nightclubs and said people were also taking their own initiative to rein in their socialising. His comments came as it emerged this morning that plans for a subsidised antigen test regime were not expected to be ready in time for today’s Cabinet meeting. Ministers are discussing the ongoing rise of Covid-19 cases at that meeting.Speaking to reporters on the way into Cabinet Mr Ryan said: “I think a lot of people have reacted to the decisions last week, a lot of people have cancelled events, have held back, and I think that was the signal to the country that a lot of people have taken up. We are reducing our socialisation, reducing our contacts.“I think we said at the time – and I think it’s good medical science – wait three weeks to see what exactly is the consequence of that.”In remarks reported by RTÉ, Mr Ryan said: “It is quite a significant change that occurred last week, around the country, everyone knows it. “Right across the board, people are rightly restricting their movements so I’d prefer to wait and see the consequences of that and then we’ll make further decisions.”Anitgen testsMr Ryan also referred to the delay in Cabinet considering a plan for subsidising antigen tests saying more time was needed “to get it right”. He said it appeared that people were not using them correctly, so it was important to get the correct information to people on how and when to use them. Despite expectations since last week that a plan for providing antigen tests to the public at subsidised cost of around €3, no proposal has yet been brought to the Cabinet by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. The initial proposal was to start with pharmacies, before other retailers, who would be able to give advice on when to use rapid tests.However, consideration is still being given to how other parts of the retail sector could participate in the scheme. A late offer from retailers on how they might come on board may be among the reasons for the delay.Opposition TDs have criticised the delay and called for antigen tests to be free.Sinn Féin’s health spokesman David Cullinane said it’s “incredible” that a year after an expert panel was set up that there still is no “coherent plan” for the use of antigen tests.He claimed there was a “lack of urgency” from Government.

Photograph: Alan BetsonTaoiseach Micheál Martin has defended the Government’s approach to dealing with the fourth wave of the pandemic as the Opposition hit out at the crisis in ICU capacity and delays in accessing PCR tests.Mr Martin said there will be 301 intensive care beds in place by the end of the year with resources for 322 “give or take” and “the aim is to get to 340 by the end of 2022”.Mr Martin also called on TDs to be more positive in the Covid message as they criticised difficulties in getting PCR tests. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said there is huge concern across society at the growing rate of infections, the prospect of further restrictions and people’s inability to get a PCR test is “putting a tin hat on it”.An explanation is need for the lack of planning and capacity and the Minister for Health should come into the Dáil to address this, she said.People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said “you can’t get a PCR test for love nor money in Dublin” and he called for walk-in PCR testing because people were suffering “inordinate delays”.But Mr Martin said some of the language was out of order. He understood criticism but “there needs to be a greater sense of giving a positive message to the public for what is being achieved.“It’s all very well to be talking about putting the tin hat on it in absolutely attempting to ridicule what’s going on.”He said “we’ve had 207,000 people PCR tested in the past seven days” and 1,900 people came in over the weekend for their first vaccine.Mr Martin said “we’ve had to deal with a once in a century pandemic for two years, and that was extremely pressurising on employees,” particularly “in the engine room of the ICU”.Ms McDonald claimed the Government was repeatedly “a day late and a dollar short” in attempting to deal with the fourth wave of Covid-19 and the lack of ICU capacity.She said large swathes of the country across a number of counties could not get PCR tests while the Government “dithers” on antigen testing. But the sharpest impact was being felt in hospital intensive care units.A report from 2009 recommended an increase in ICU beds from 289 to 579. “So successive governments have known about this problem for more than a decade, and to have done nothing.”Ms McDonald also said that the state of the health service was the reason for the repeated and lengthy restrictions and she asked when would the Minister for Health put in place a “permanent investment that we get to a reasonable place and not be constantly in this danger and jeopardy”.She also said that “earlier this month a transplant operation was cancelled in Dublin’s Mater hospital because there was no ICU bed available.“I cannot imagine how distressing this was for the patient for their family, for the doctors, indeed, who had to make this call. There should have been an ICU bed for this patient. There would have been an ICU bed had Government planned properly.”TransplantThe Taoiseach told her that “I believe that operation should have gone ahead”. He said as minister for health he set up the Mater’s transplant unit “so it’s a cause of great regret to me that the transplant going ahead. There is an internal inquiry going on in relation to that.”He insisted that the Government was planning and preparing and that 300 beds were in place. He added that 11,000 people had been employed in the health service in the last two years and resources were not an issue but “the rate at which we can recruit” people and put the systems in place.He acknowledged that more ICU beds were needed. “We’ve gone from 225 to 300 intensive care beds and we will have to go more in 2022, a minimum of 340.”Mr Martin also insisted that “we haven’t had prolonged restrictions. We’ve reopened the economy and society and that increases socialisation leads to an increase in infections.”PCR tests Labour health spokesman Duncan Smith said that delayed decision making by the Government has resulted in the slow roll out of the booster campaign and he too criticised the delays in people accessing PCR tests.He said that people had to sit at their computers until midnight pressing “re-set” to try and get a PCR test appointment.But the Taoiseach said that over 600,000 people had received the booster vaccine and it was “well under way” and that 207,000 people had received a PCR test in the past seven days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Officials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissenters"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccine creates t cells gives better immune response current","story":"A new vaccine designed to specifically create T-cells against Covid produces a better immune response than the alternatives already in use, according to trial data.The CoVac-1 jab has been developed and made by academics at the University of Tubingen, in Germany.The cells form part of the immune response to protect people against infections and often work in tandem with antibodies. However, while antibody levels often decline over time and need boosting, T-cells have the ability to stay in the bloodstream for several years.Evidence is emerging that T-cell levels from vaccines may be key in conferring long-term protection against Covid, but studying the level of them in a person\u0027s system is difficult.The induction of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immunity is a central goal for vaccine development and of particular importance for patients with congenital or acquired B-cell deficiencies, the researchers wrote in a paper published in Nature. The latter comprise cancer patients with disease or treatment-related immunoglobulin deficiency.Phase one trial data from 36 people who received the experimental jab early this year showed the vaccine to be safe and capable of producing a robust immune response.The scientists said the vaccine\u0027s T-cell response surpassed those detected after SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as after vaccination with approved vaccines.Data suggest that the vaccine, a single shot in the stomach, produces 3.5 times as many T-cells as the PfizerBioNTech jab and 20 times as many as the AstraZeneca vaccine. Furthermore, vaccine-induced T-cell responses were unaffected by current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, the scientists said.Although the study is small, the results are promising because nobody in the trial tested positive for Covid in the three months following their T-cell jab. The team suggest the vaccine would make for an effective complementary vaccine, particularly for the elderly and immunocompromised, alongside the currently approved jabs.T-cells are becoming of increasing interest to vaccine makers and clinicians as a way to further protect people against disease.The antibody response is what drives the immediate reaction or defence of the body when you\u0027re attacked by the virus and the T-cell response takes a little longer to come in but it\u0027s actually more durable, it lasts longer and the body remembers that longer, Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, said on Tuesday.T-cells do matter, in particular as it relates to the durability of the response, especially in older people.More from NewsSenior politicians, fresh-faced MPs and the Music Man Project say farewell to Sir David AmessMeredith Kercher’s killer did not serve enough time in prison, says lawyer for Briton’s familyCovid vaccine passports will not be extended to Scottish pubs and restaurantsFire chief who quit over Grenfell says lessons from disasters overseas were not learnedPoor diets pose ‘major’ threat to health and planet, warns reportMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside compulsory covid vaccination conundrum","story":"As Austria’s Covid cases surged to a record high of more than 15,800 a day last week, Alexander Schallenberg found himself compelled to take extreme steps. As well as enforcing a new month-long lockdown, the chancellor announced that, from February next year, Austria would become the first European country to make vaccination compulsory.The rationale behind Schallenberg’s decision is that ongoing vaccine hesitancy is thought to be one of the driving forces behind the country’s recent sharp rise in cases. Austria has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe only 65.7 per cent of the population are fully jabbed, a rate lower than the UK (68.7 per cent), France, Italy, Portugal and Germany.According to Andreas Bergthaler, a virologist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, there appears to be a link between regions in Austria with low vaccine uptake and particularly high Covid-19 rates, such as the province of Salzburg, one of the hotspots of the current outbreak. “The vaccination rate in Salzburg seems to correlate at least partially with the high infection numbers,” says Bergthaler.Over the next two months, the Austrian government will put into place a legal framework for the mandate. According to the latest reports, authorities will first offer an appointment for anyone who has yet to be vaccinated, before penalties of up to 3,600 euros (£3,022) will follow if the offer is rejected. For those who are already double-vaccinated, there will still be fines of up to 1,500 euros (£1,259), if they refuse to get a booster shot. Exemptions will only be offered to those who are able to prove, via a doctor’s certificate, that they cannot receive a vaccine on medical grounds, such as severe allergies to all currently available vaccines or those who had an adverse reaction to the first dose.But while this decision has been prompted by the increasing urgency of the situation in Austria – in Salzburg, intensive care units are under such strain that some hospitals have been forced to consider turning away all but the worst patients – it remains a deeply controversial one.Only Indonesia, Micronesia and Turkmenistan have introduced full population Covid-19 vaccine mandates, and the subject has become increasingly politically charged. In Vienna, protests turned violent as an estimated 40,000 people took to the streets to show their anger against the new mandate, while similar demonstrations were held in Rotterdam against a proposed law that would prevent unvaccinated people from entering businesses.While intensive care doctors in Austria are reportedly relieved by the news of the vaccine mandate, other scientists are not so comfortable with the idea.“I think vaccines are really crucial and key, but I find it sad if we need mandatory vaccination because we cannot convince people otherwise,” says Bergthaler. “There might be certain parts of society where it would make sense, say, people working in healthcare and nurseries who are dealing with vulnerable people on a daily basis. But in the long run, I think it would make more sense to invest in communicating and convincing people rather than forcing them.”Ethicists also remain unsure that the severity of the pandemic warrants compulsory vaccines at a population level. According to Dominic Wilkinson, professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford, the ethical case for mandatory jabs is stronger for healthcare and care home workers than the wider public.“If we had an outbreak of a disease that was like the bubonic plague or Ebola, that had devastatingly high mortality, and we had a massive threat to our health system and way of life, I think there would be a strong case for having a vaccine mandate,” he says. “I’m not convinced that this pandemic is sufficiently severe that it’s ethically proportionate to have compulsory vaccination for the general population.”  But while Austria and nations such as Romania and Bulgaria – which have double vaccination rates of just 34 per cent and 22 per cent respectively – have struggled to overcome widespread mistrust of the Covid jabs, other European countries have been far more successful.Portugal is among the world’s leaders in vaccinations with roughly 87 per cent of its 10.3 million people fully inoculated, and the daily death rate correspondingly dropping to single digit numbers. Like Austria, Portugal is politically ided with the country run by a minority Left wing government, and its citizens have also been exposed to a flood of vaccine misinformation on social media channels.The issue of Covid vaccination may have become something of a political tug-of-war between rival parties in Austria, but the Portuguese have deliberately kept their campaign almost completely separate from politics. Rather than being run by elected ministers, Portugal’s vaccine rollout has been orchestrated by former military officer Vice Admiral Henrique Gouveia e Melo, whose communication policy has prioritised building credibility and trust.    Scientists say that this apolitical approach has been the bedrock of Portugal’s success. “Vaccination has been politicised in many countries, which has undermined our response, attitudes and uptake,” says Daniel Salmon, who directs the institute for vaccine safety at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “We need science to drive public health to drive politics, not politics driving public health that drives science.”Yet vaccine mandates are nothing new and, in recent centuries, played a key role in eradicating smallpox, one of the deadliest diseases in human history. Smallpox vaccines were compulsory in the UK for nearly 150 years after English doctor Edward Jenner developed the first jab in 1796.More recently, similar mandates have been utilised as a way of boosting vaccine uptake in schoolchildren in the wake of rising hesitancy among parents, a trend that the World Health Organisation described as one of the gravest threats to public health in 2019.In the US, all 50 states require schoolchildren to receive the MMR vaccine as well as jabs for polio, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and varicella. In the past five years, legislators in Australia, France and Italy have restricted school access for children who haven’t received the country’s recommended panel of vaccinations, such as MMR. Australia has also introduced a so-called “No Jab, No Pay” legislation, which withholds financial child support from the parents of unvaccinated children. In Italy, parents can also receive fines of up to €500 (£419) for sending children to school who have not been vaccinated against chickenpox, polio, measles, mumps and rubella, while children under six can be turned away.Early data suggests that these mandates have succeeded in achieving their desired goals. In France for example, the number of fully vaccinated children born after 2018 has increased significantly compared to those born in previous years, while childhood immunisation rates in Australia are now close to 95 per cent.But they can backfire. Vaccine mandates have resulted in violent riots in Brazil, while some have linked them to the rise of the anti-vaccine movement in Europe. After California introduced legislation in 2016, which made it impossible for parents to legally avoid immunising their children on anything other than medical grounds, the number of unvaccinated children being home-educated quadrupled between 2016 and 2019.Health experts fear that compulsory Covid vaccination will diminish trust in the healthcare system over time. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have already called mandates a double-edged sword, fearing that overly draconian rules will induce an even greater number of sceptical anti-vaxxers.Bergthaler would prefer governments to pursue greater engagement with the public on the issue, attempting to actively create an open dialogue with communities who are resistant to the idea of Covid jabs.“This is not even that specific to Covid,” he says. “We see it with the seasonal flu vaccines, where in Austria rates are really low. I think it needs a lot more communication, not just TV commercials but reaching out to people, having testimonials, finding peers among different layers of society. So not just making it one inidual’s decision but trying to convey that this is getting us out of this situation together. That wasn’t politically seen as an attractive strategy, and I think it is haunting us now.”More from NewsSenior politicians, fresh-faced MPs and the Music Man Project say farewell to Sir David AmessMeredith Kercher’s killer did not serve enough time in prison, says lawyer for Briton’s familyCovid vaccine passports will not be extended to Scottish pubs and restaurantsFire chief who quit over Grenfell says lessons from disasters overseas were not learnedPoor diets pose ‘major’ threat to health and planet, warns reportMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us wont accept hrh president meghan","story":"This column has worried before that the Duchess of Sussex is riding for a fall in the way she wields her title in America. Apparently, she has taken to offering her opinions to media outlets there, using that name.It is true that many Americans are interested in British royalty, often exaggeratedly so, but this does not mean that they actually want a monarchy or aristocracy back. They have flourished without either for nearly 250 years. Right from the start, the Founding Fathers gave a great deal of thought to this. The United States Constitution declares that: “No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States.”This surely clashes with the Duchess of Sussex’s possible political ambitions. She could not become the president of the United States, or even a humble congresswoman, if she held her current title. Worse still, from the point of view of US law, she is Her Royal Highness – a standing declaration that she owes allegiance to a foreign state and a king (or queen). She is likely to keep this title unless she and Harry orce. Her husband, of course, is His Royal Highness, so I do not see how he could be the First Gentleman if his wife were to enter the White House: he would too be “accepting an office of profit or trust” (the office of the First Lady is federally funded).We are all familiar with the expression “Hollywood royalty”, but I do not believe the United States of America could have a genuinely royal president, any more than the Archbishop of Canterbury could become Pope. If she does seek the nomination, I hope Meghan will drop the HRH and the name of my home county, which have never suited her, and run as plain Markle.It is highly unusual for former bosses of the National Trust to break ranks, however privately critical they may be of current trends, so I am interested by a recent intervention, not previously picked up in the press, by the NT’s former chairman, Sir William Proby.Sir William was speaking at the annual general meeting of the Historic Houses Association (HHA), the trade union, you might say, for great country houses open to the public which are owner-occupied. Being private, they are not charities, and so receive far fewer tax advantages and grants. Sir William is the HHA’s patron.Normally emollient, Sir William was outspoken about the National Trust. He quoted Henry James: “‘Of all the great things that the English have invented ... the most perfect, the most characteristic is the well appointed, well administered, well filled country house.’ It is a sobering thought that we here account for so much of the privately owned part of this great heritage,” Sir William added.HHA responsibility for that heritage had grown greater, he said, “since that great institution, the National Trust, which did so much to save our great houses in the period before and after the war to the benefit and enjoyment of millions of our fellow countrymen and women seems to have turned its back on this part of the National Heritage, apparently wishing to portray their houses as monuments to slavery, exploitation and inequality.”These are strong words, not lightly used. They imply that the Trust, in part at least, is not fulfilling its charitable purposes: it is disowning what it owns, although it knows it cannot, by law, sell the houses off. Sir William’s argument implies that the people who run the Trust no longer love this most famous aspect of its patrimony. The Trust’s position is almost as if the Royal Horticultural Society were to attack flowers, or the RSPB were to announce that birds are a real nuisance.Sir William deserves to be listened to. The National Trust is currently in the (secretive) process of appointing its new chairman. Whoever it chooses, it must be someone who truly cares about the great houses it once did so much to rescue. If you don’t love one bit of our heritage, you probably don’t much care for the rest of it – gardens, landscapes, wild places, farms, coastline – either.For some time, a cottage along a farm track where I like to walk has displayed the following board, painted in crude red letters beside its fence, “SLOW! BLOODY PISSED OFF ASKING NICELY”.Passing the place on foot last week, we noticed standing beside the placard one of those Remembrance Day silhouettes of a Tommy which have become very popular in recent years. It was surrounded by a tiny field of poppies.My immediate reaction was to react prissily against this juxtaposition. Wasn’t it rather insulting to our war dead to commemorate them next to such an unceremonious message?On further reflection, however, I realised my objection was ridiculous. The original hand-painted notice was perfectly in the tradition of the private soldier from these islands which runs back to Shakespeare’s Henry V and beyond – blunt, humorous, disrespectful.More from NewsAstraZeneca vaccine could be key reason why Britain is weathering the new Covid stormSenior politicians, fresh-faced MPs and the Music Man Project say farewell to Sir David AmessMeredith Kercher’s killer did not serve enough time in prison, says lawyer for Briton’s familyCovid vaccine passports will not be extended to Scottish pubs and restaurantsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic raab hosts lavish party","story":"Dominic Raab hosts lavish party for donors and activists at grace-and-favour mansionMr Raab hosted  donors and supporters at Chevening House, the Foreign Secretary’s official taxpayer-funded mansion - as he doubles the number of activists and campaign staff in a desperate bid to hold on to his seatDominic Raab at the Lord Mayors Banquet in London last week Image: REUTERSByMikey SmithWhitehall Correspondent:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsDominic Raab held a lavish thank you party for  donors and supporters at his taxpayer-funded grace and favour mansion, it can be revealed.

Mr Raab must publish details of how much was spent to rent Chevening House, who paid for this visit and whether it has been used to host other local party political events. “It shows yet again why Dominic Raab is not fit to be a government minister or to represent the people of Esher and Walton.” Mr Raabaposs majority in his aposblue wallapos Esther and Walton seat collapsed from , to just , in the  General Election.

Currently there are no estimates as to how many medics are being trained in the pipeline to meet estimated future demand.The amendment has been proposed ex-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt - now chairman of the powerful Health and Social Care Committee.It would force the Government to publish independent workforce projections twice a year to ensure the pipeline of clinical staff in training meets future demand.  Mr Hunt said: Last week the Prime Minister committed to ‘look at the idea’ - backed by every major NHS organisation in the country and every opposition party - of independent workforce training estimates to give hope to burnt-out NHS staff that we are training enough frontline staff for the future. Today we will hear the Government’s response. Warm words will not be enough. Ignoring the cries from frontline staff everywhere about the current workforce crisis will risk both patient and staff safety. “After three lockdowns to protect NHS capacity, surely it’s time to learn the lesson that we need to match supply with demand, and once and for all make sure we’re training the number of doctors and nurses we need for the future.” There are around  NHS staffing vacancies in England.

It is also a very well paid job. MPs get paid £, a year – that’s more than  percent of people in our country. It should be a full-time job, too.But too many MPs just don’t treat it like that - instead they treat it as an opportunity to chase corporate cash through second jobs.When they do that, they are short-changing the public and disrespecting our democracy. We have heard all the fake Tory arguments about how these second jobs give MPs real-world experience.That’s rubbish. The Health Secretary, for example, was getting paid £, an hour earlier this year for a previous role advising a US investment bank. He was getting the same again for a third job too. That’s not the real world lived in by my constituents and tens of millions more. Isn’t it funny how Tory MPs who justy the racket of second jobs never choose to work for low wages in supermarkets, as bus drivers, or in care homes  The truth is that their big money extra jobs do not make Members of Parliament more in touch with the real world. They make them even more out of touch with the people they’re meant to represent. MPs aren’t being paid for what they know – but who they know. They wouldn’t get these vast sums from big corporationsthey weren’t MPs with political connections. Recent events show exactly why we need a ban on second jobs. That’s why I am bringing forward a new parliamentary Bill today. My Bill is clear and bold: no paid second jobs for MPs at all except in some very limited circumstances.  No-one can serve two masters - and for MPs their priority must be their constituents. Of course, second jobs will be allowed where it’s about maintaining their professional qualication like in nursing orthey are working on the frontline in our NHS as doctors or in another emergency service.Those roles are about genuine public service and have nothing to do with the scandal that has been shaking parliament.For my Bill to now be able to become law, the government needs to give it time on the parliamentary agenda. Boris Johnson should do thathe is actually serious about acting against the ever-closer relationship between big business and our politics. Parliament now must show that it understands that the rot in our political system is deep and needs cutting out. It is time to ban second jobs for MPs.

New Government guidance warns people are more likely to catch Covid or pass it onthey are in crowded spaces or where there is limited fresh air. Previously people had been advised to use lateral flow tests twice a week. Now it is advised to take the rapid Covid test evensomeone is heading to a space where people are wearing face coverings. The updated advice does not explicitly say people should take the rapid tests before shopping or partying, but it references crowded spaces. Nicola Sturgeon went a step further than the British Government and urged Scots to take the rapid tests before socialising or going on any shopping occasion.  The First Minister of Scotland told MSPs: We have been asking everyone to take a regular lateral flow test. We have been asking people to do this twice a week, however over the festive period we are asking for extra effort. So on any occasion that you are socialising with others, whether that is going out for drinks or dinner, visiting someone at home or even going shopping somewhere that might be crowded, please take an LFD test before you go. Andit is positive do not go. Cabinet Office guidance states: You may wish to take a rapid lateral flow testit is expected that there will be a period of high risk that day.This includes spending time in crowded and enclosed spaces, or before visiting people who are at higher risk of severe illnessthey get COVID-. It comes as the World Health Organisation said Europe could experience more than two million Covid- deaths by March. Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, said: “In order to live with this virus and continue our daily lives, we need to take a ‘vaccine plus’ approach.“Taken together, wearing a mask, washing hands, ventilating indoor spaces, keeping physical distance and sneezing into your elbow are simple, effective ways of gaining control over the virus and keeping societies going. Tory Ministers are thought to be largely unconcerned with Britain being affected by the wave of Covid hitting Europe.Boris Johnson has said there is no need to introduce fresh lockdown restrictions despite rising cases across the continent.“Of course we are concerned about the potential from that disease, Mr Johnson said speaking at the CBI conference. “You have got to be humble in the face of nature but at the moment we see nothing in the data to say that we need to move from plan A to plan B, or any other plan. “The best single thing you can all do is get your booster. When you are called forward to get it, please do so.”  On a similar note, Ms Sturgeon said the Covid vaccine passport scheme will not need to be extended. The Scottish Government had been considering extending its Covid passports system to pubs and cinemas from December  in Scotland.But Ms Sturgeon said Covid cases are currently stable and indeed slightly declining and there would be a signicant impact on businesses. The Shadow Health Secretary fears the second jab rate needs to drastically increase to avoid another winter lockdown. Jonathan Ashworth told Sky News: “There are still parts of the country where the second jab rate, like Leicester or Blackburn, still isn’t good enough. We really need to drive that up. “And of course you need to put in other protections as well. So the ball is in ministers’ court really. They’ve got to put these protections in place to avoid further restrictions, but I definitely do not want another one of Boris Johnson’s lockdowns.

Little Freddie Gittins received his diagnosis on  July of this year, after his mum Emma died from breast cancer at just  years old in March. Freddieaposs dad Jamie, , said: The news of Freddieaposs leukaemia just broke me. After going through the worst of cancer with Emma, my first thought was that my son was going to die. I couldn’t bear the thought of losing both of them. However, despite battling a horrible illness, Jamie says his son is a warrior who would have made his mum proud. When Emma was alive, she wrote in a blog, Boobs Behaving Badly, which documented her journey with cancer treatment - and it left a mark on people. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Jamie said: After she passed away there were so many messages from people saying the blog had helped them through their own diagnosis. I knew it had provided a very positive outlook for both Emma and her readers, so I wanted to do the same for Freddie and, over the summer, we set up a blog for him, too, called Fight Said Fred, documenting his cancer journey.Emma was first diagnosed with cancer in October  when she was  years old. But after chemotherapy and radiotherapy, she was in remission by August . During the same year, Jamie and Emma separated, but they continued to co-parent Freddie and their eldest son Noah, now . According to Jamie, the pair remained the best of friends. For a few months, Emma was perfectly healthy, but in February  she received the devastating news that her cancer had ed - and it was terminal. We’ve always been very honest with the boys about Emma’s diagnosis. We explained to them that the cancer wouldn’t go away this time, Jamie explained. We didn’t want to hide anything from them and, looking back, I’m glad we took this approach. They understood as best they could what was happening to their mum and itaposs helping them to grieve. On th March , Emma passed away surrounded by friends and family in Hereford Hospital But just three months after her death, Jamie noticed a change in Freddie and took him to see a doctor. He said: In June, I noticed that Freddie was really tired all the time - incredibly lethargic. He would come home from school, put on the telly and fall asleep within five minutes. By July, I noticed he was getting a yellow tinge to his skin, so I booked a doctor’s appointment and they sent us straight to hospital. We were there all night while Freddie had tests done and, at around am, a doctor took me off into a private room to explain the results. On  July, Freddie was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia - an aggressive cancer of the white blood cells. Jamie said: I was expecting the doctor to say it was a liver infection, so when I heard leukaemia, I just broke down. I couldn’t bear the thought of losing Freddie. We had just buried his mum and now I was panicking that I would also have to bury my son. We had barely had any time to process losing Emma before we were back on cancer wards, this time for Freddie.  Jamie said one of the most dficult things was to tell his son what was wrong with him. He said: Freddie was asleep in the hospital bed when I found out. I just sat by his side all night, watching him sleep. When he woke up in the morning, I explained to him that he had cancer and would need to have treatment. I told him he was going to have a terrible few months, but he would get better. When he heard the word cancer, he asked me, ‘Like Mummy ’ So, I explained that it was a dferent type, but that it was cancer, too.After explaining the heartbreaking news to Freddie, Jamie also had to tell Noah about his little brotheraposs diagnosis. He said: Noah came to see Freddie in Hereford Hospital.  I repeated what Iaposd told Freddie to Noah. Heaposs a lot older than his years and he understood. I explained to him that chemotherapy would make Freddie better. Noah turned around and said aposwe know what itaposs like nowapos. Jamie said Freddie took after his courageous mum and showed incredible strength after his diagnosis. Jamie said: We spent two weeks at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, because his liver and pancreas were inflamed. Once that was under control, Freddie started chemotherapy. Nothing has really fazed him. He’s been ridiculously brave. He’s such a warrior. He only really got upset when he realised he would lose his hair, because he loves his hair.  Other than that, he has pretty much accepted all the treatment that has been thrown at him. He’s so resilient. So far, Freddieaposs progress scans have showed that the level of cancer in his blood is continuing to decline - and the family is hopeful heaposll soon be given the all-clear. Jamie said: There is now only a tiny trace of leukaemia in his system, so we’re giving that a final kick with chemo and, hopefully, that will mark the end of Freddie’s treatment. After that, he will be monitored, regularly at first but then routinely for the rest of his le to make sure it doesn’t come back. I think all three of us are very excited for that day, so that we can start to heal properly and enjoy our future. Reflecting on a rollercoaster few years for the family, Jamie thinks itaposs hit Noah the hardest.  He’s felt quite helpless, whereas both Freddie and I have been kept busy with the medical appointments. We’re looking forward to a bit of normality in the future, though. As well as running the blog, the family set up a GoFundMe page to help Jamie pay for fun experiences and activities for Freddie. He said: I was quite overwhelmed by the fundraising page, as I’m not one to ask for help, but Freddie really deserves some fun after what have been a horrible couple of years - both the boys do. Freddie loves wrestling and is obsessed with WWE right now, so we went to see it in Birmingham a few weeks ago. It will be nice to create some happy memories with the boys and continue to plan outings like this in the future. Jamie hopes the blog can show people that positive things can come from a bad situation. And Jamie hopes that through Freddie’s blog they can show people that positive things come out of a bad situation. He said: Finding out your child has cancer is every parent’s worst nightmare come true. It’s completely devastating, but I want to get across to people that le doesn’t just stop when you receive that diagnosis. It’s not all bad. We’ve had some fun times in hospital, laughing and spending time together as a family, both when Emma was a patient and now with Freddie. You have to make the most of what you have and you have to find a way to keep going. Being a parent of a child with cancer can be a very isolating experience, but it doesn’t have to be either. There is a community of people in the same situation online. Emma left such a positive legacy with her blog and I’m proud that we can carry that on now with Freddie’s.

Ray Edwards, , thought his estate agent was winding him up during a viewing when he mentioned that the Queen frontman used to live in the house. Freddie Mercury, whose real name was Farrokh Bulsara, came from Zanzibar to Gladstone Avenue in Feltham with his parents in , when he was just  years old. While living in the west London house, he started exploring his incredible musical talents, before going on to join Queen as lead singer in . Ray, who is retired, thought his estate agent was fibbing when he name-dropped the iconic star - but after buying the property, he realised it was true. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here But in , when Queen band member Brian May unveiled a British Heritage blue plaque on the house, he was finally convinced - and even let  guests into the house to watch the unveiling. Ray said: “I’m proud to say I live in Freddie Mercury’s old house. It’s nice to have some sort of recognition of Freddie. “The plaque does stand out. The idea is that people look at it and that makes them think of Freddie and reflect on his le and his contribution. “I do look at it occasionally and reflect, I will admit. I’m proud to have it there. Freddie was a very talented person. He added heaposd heard a few rumours the house had been owned by someone famous when he first viewed it, but heaposd never been convinced there was any truth to the rumours.  And when the estate agent kept bringing up Mercuryaposs name during the viewing, Ray was certain it was just a sales tactic. “I wasn’t surethe estate agent was taking the pee,” Ray added. “I did a quick search on the internet and it was dficult to find out who used to live here.” Since the home was occupied by a famous face, itaposs changed quite a bit. The loft has been converted, while one of the three bedrooms has been made into a bathroom - but sadly, during renovations, Ray didnapost find any clues that gave an insight into the le of Freddie Mercury. Ray currently rents the staraposs old bedroom out to a mum and her daughter - who are well aware of the incredibly history of the place where they live. The Bulsara family moved out of the house in , when Freddie was  and just starting out in Queen - where he went on to sell more than  million records. But while living in the house, Mercury made friends with bandmates Roger Taylor and Brian May - meeting John Deacon a year later in .  Although he appreciates the incredible history of the house he lives in, Ray admits Queen isnapost quite his cup of tea. “I wouldn’t say I was a huge fan,” he said. Though, I wouldn’t say I dislike their music. I do have some of their music, some of their records. “But I’m not one of these people who idolise them and stand outside gazing at the plaque.” Mr Edwards estimates the plaque attracts two visitors a week, though this used to be more before the pandemic. He says he doesnapost mind people ogling his property as they walk by - even when fans loiter at his front gate. Freddie Mercury died at the age of  in  after developing bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS. His death shook the world, and shone a light on the AIDS epidemic around the globe. Next week, BBC will release a new documentary, Freddie Mercury: The Final Act, which features new interviews with Brian May and Roger Taylor.

Beth Kates, a former dancer, was searching for a new set of underwear during lockdown and found that women in their s were a forgotten market. Recalling the frustrating search, Beth said she was angered by airbrushed photos that she believed promoted unrealistic body imagery - arguing the campaigns were more about appealing to the male gaze than real women. So the -year-old from Uckfield, Sussex, decided to make the change she wanted to see in the industry and set up her own brand, Liberty  Love. Although she had no retail experience whatsoever, her vision was clear - she wanted to only use real women as models.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Beth started teaching dance at schools after giving birth to her twins when she was  years old, after a career in teaching musical theatre - but when one of her sons was permanently excluded from school, she had to give up work altogether to look after him. He has been diagnosed with autism and ADHD, she explained. In the end, we had a situation where he was four-years-old, and wasnapost able to access education at all. In , he was mainly at home with me, with no hope of ever attending a mainstream school again so I had to give up work. While taking on some freelance work, Beth sought out new opportunities for jobs she could do while taking care of her son. In November , she noticed her -year-old daughter was struggling with body image issues while looking for new underwear for herself. Beth added: “My daughter wasn’t eating properly, she was being very image conscious and beating herself up about her body because she didnapost look like someone from Love Island.“I was very disappointed by how underwear companies market themselves. They never feature women of my age, or women of normal shapes and sizes. “They are overly provocative and all about being sexy for the bedroom and for a man! Beauty is more than skin deep. “I was inundated with newsletter emails telling me to wear certain underwear for Valentine’s Day or date night, but why couldn’t I wear sexy underwear for the school run  She added itaposs no wonder women have negative body images when theyaposre bombarded with perfect images of how we should all look. “I also started to really notice that nobody markets for my age group at all it’s like once youaposve hit , you’re forgotten!”  Taking matters into her own hands, she decided to launch Liberty  Love for women of all ages, every day of the year. She wants to help all women feel glamorous and comfortable in their own skin - whether theyaposre on the school run or on a night out. Beth explained: Why are you putting your grey MS pants on in the morning  Thataposs not going to make you feel good. Some of the underwear out there is ridiculously expensive and only practicalyouaposre standing still because itaposs literally like bits of string. That’s not suitable for menopausal women! We all like to think that we are Samantha from Sex and The City however the reality is we need more than  pieces of lace when we’re on the school run. While having a website built and designing her line, Beth admits she learned on the job.  She used small manufacturers to create a line of lingerie and swimwear that she hopes will fit with the ethos of the company. She said: “Body positivity isnapost about whether itaposs okay to be a size  or a size  - it’s OK to be both! “My daughter gets body shamed at school for being too thin, while her best friend gets body shamed for being too big. This is what I’m trying to change. “We’ve had some negative messages online asking why we use women with tattoos and above a size  - but I always write back to explain that beauty is more than skin deep. “Most of the feedback we get is great and our customers love the products.” While learning her new craft, Beth also figured out to measure bra sizes after realising most women wear the wrong size. She explained: “I remember going to MS to get measured and you’re just behind some grubby shower curtain thing with somebody about  years old and itaposs just awkward. “Most people guess what size they really are and probably donapost realise the impact that has. Underwear is really dependent.”Have you been on a body positivity journey  Send your stories to jessica.taylor@reachplcSince launching just four months ago Beth has been inundated with women of all ages feeling they are finally being understood and seen again.

Doctors insist that you should always see your GPyou are worriedSelf-diagnosing online is not helpful, go to your doctor Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByNatasha HoltBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Nov | commentsPeople feeling anxious or nervous should not stop them from going to their GP, say doctors.Research can make us worry about our health as well, and there are often new scientic developments and discoveries that can question our own health despite us feeling completely normal. An uncomfortable twitching around the eyes can be a way to identy a vitamin B deficiency, while sleep patterns can indicate high cholesterol.Symptoms like these and many more can worry people, but people may still feel they do not want to go to the doctor. Going to the doctor can be daunting for some people. Some avoid it out of fear or embarrassment, while others may feel as though their particularly medical ailment may be a burden, some may just ignore the signs of a problem. However, a quick trip online can scare us all due to self-diagnosis, diagnosis that should be done by medically trained professionals So what are the right questions to ask about your health The top questions to ask your doctor ahead of visiting your GP surgeryDoctors are busier than ever and as a patient you can sometimes feel under pressure not to waste their time. That means we often leave the surgery or end an online consultation and only later realise we didn’t ask a crucial question. Additionally, we don’t always remember the things we are told. One research study shows that when patients were asked what they were told six days after their appointment, on average they could only manage to recall three facts. Excellent consultation skills are one of the most important tools of any doctor’s working le, said Dr Deborah Lee from the Dr Fox Online Pharmacy . To meet a patient’s needs involves understanding their ideas, concerns and expectations. That means giving them the time to ask questions, checking their understanding and ensuring they leave with key take-home messages. As doctors we’d always rather you asked anything you are worried about and as a patient it’s best to go into your consultation armed with the right questions to ask. So what are the right questions What can I do to help my condition  Research shows that when a patient is fully engaged with their own healthcare, the outcome is much better. You need to be empowered to make informed decisions to allow you to take appropriate action and make better lestyle choices, explained Dr Lee. It’s important you leave the consultation understanding what you can do to help yourself. Your doctor cannot manage your le for you. This is down to the decisions you make for yourself every day. So knowing the best way to manage a condition increases your chances of staying healthy. If you’re worried you’ll forget key information, take a friend or family member along. Never be embarrassed to write notes as you talk to your GP.What are these tests for As a patient, you must give your consent before any tests or procedures can be carried out for you. Giving consent means you understand what is being proposed, are able to ask any questions you have, and you have agreed to go ahead. You should understand exactly what you are being tested for, especiallythere would be a potentially severe outcomethe test was positive, says Dr Lee. Better communication is also much safer for you, as certain tests require you to do certain things beforehand. Your GP should also explain the instructions for tests, for example,you should fast beforehand oryou need to arrange transport and support at home after a procedure.Are there any alternatives to this treatment  Choice is important because all treatments have an outcome and we never know that outcome until after the event, explains Dr Lee. People dfer very markedly in their views about health and their wishes for treatment, and these must always be respected. A doctor can’t force a patient down a specic pathwaythey prefer an alternative. Remember, you’re also entitled to refuse treatment altogether. So make sure you understand what’s available to you.Should I get a second opinion Donapost be worried about getting a second opinion, it is important to make yourself feel at ease and trust the medical process. This is a perfectly reasonable request, especiallyyou have a serious diagnosis and are trying to decide on treatment, insists Dr Lee. However, sometimes wanting a second opinion may reflect a lack of understanding about your condition, confusion about the proposed treatment, or a lack of confidence in your doctor. If you’re having doubts you can ask your doctor to refer you for a second opinion or arrange to see another doctor at your practice.What should I doit starts to get worse  It is important to understand your condition and know when to call for help. Good examples are asthma or diabetes, says Dr Lee, These can quickly spiral out of control and even be fatal. By understanding how to monitor your disease, the trigger factors and warning signs and when to call for help, tragedies can be avoided. You can also correctly adapt the use of your medication.How do I get my results Patients experience extreme anxiety waiting for results, so you should be told exactly when to expect your test results and how they will be given, insists Dr Lee. Some patients assume ‘no news is good news’ but occasionally results go astray, soyou’re aware you haven’t received them as promised you’ll know when to chase them up.Are there any side effects to medication  Your doctor should tell you about the common side effects, but you should also read the information leaflet inside your medication. This is important because some side effects may be mild and get better quite quickly as your body adjusts to the drug, while some may not. You should know the symptoms and signs of an acute allergic reaction, for example, which is a medical emergency, says Dr Lee. Any unusual or severe side effects should be reported to your doctor immediately.Where can I find out more about my condition You can use the internet to try and give yourself answers, but it is still better to talk to your doctor. Your doctor may even recommend useful websites for you to look at.It’s a far better idea to ask your doctor to recommend good quality websites where you can trust what you read, advises Dr Lee.

The child murderer was freed from prison in September on a strict set of conditions - only to be recalled earlier this month. Authorities intervened after he approached young women in the street and amid concerns he was trying to cheat lie detector tests. Pitchfork was jailed for le after raping and strangling Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, both , in Leicestershire in  and . News of his release and rearrest prompted a public outcry - which is thought to have pushed the Justice Secretary to act.Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror.It is said that, going forward, Mr Raab wants the Parole Board to focus far more on the potential dangers before a decision is made.He believes the board is adrt from its core purpose and he wants to make sure it is exactly as he wants it, a source told MailOnline.Risk to the public must be the top consideration. A large-scale review of the Parole Board launched  months ago had been due to report its findings by Christmas, the site said. But this has reportedly since been delayed for Mr Raab to take a fresh look at the system. Pitchforkaposs -year minimum term was cut by two years in , before he was moved to an open prison in . He was then released earlier this year.  He is understood to have approached young women on multiple occasions near to the bail hostel where he was living. Probation staff feared he was trying to establish a connection with them. Pitchfork was also observed to generally have a “bad attitude” because he was not as engaging and open with officials as they would want him to be. There were also suggestions that, while taking part in polygraph tests, which he is subjected to as part of his licence conditions, he may have tried to counteract the results by controlling and altering his physical responses with breathing techniques but this was spotted by staff. Although officials said Pitchfork was not recalled for committing any further offences, the step was taken as a preventative measure after the string of incidents raised fears of a concerning pattern of behaviour. David Baker, the officer who caught Pitchfork but said he was not consulted on his release, told a newspaper the incident was “expected” and not a surprise.  He added: “Pitchfork has reverted to type by approaching these girls.” Pitchfork was subjected to more than  licence conditions, which the Ministry of Justicedescribed as some of the strictest “ever set”. Following a hearing in March, the Parole Board ruled that Pitchfork was “suitable for release”, despite this being denied in  and . The board, which is independent of the Government, said it relies “heavily” on the evidence from professional witnesses who monitor and work closely with an offender. Officials including probation officers and a prison psychologist “all supported his release”, the board said, adding that the then justice secretary Robert Buckland was represented at the hearing and “did not oppose release” at that time. Then in June, in the wake of public concern about the release, Mr Buckland asked the board to re-examine the decision under the so-called reconsideration mechanism. for our newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information and changes at www.mirror email .But the Parole Board rejected the Government’s challenge against its ruling the following month, announcing that the application to reconsider the decision had been refused. Concerns had been raised by professionals he worked with about his capacity to “manipulate and deceive”. While out on temporary licence, Pitchfork tried to get access to a smartphone, gave a female shopworker chocolates and told her lies. But senior Parole Board judge Michael Topolski QC, who considered the application to review the decision, found officials did not find this “made him unsuitable for release”. Pitchfork’s case now has to be referred to the Parole Board within  days. Sometimes the circumstances of a recall to prison are considered “on paper”, meaning by solely reviewing documents. But given the seriousness of this case, there will most likely be a parole hearing. This is anticipated to take place within six months and will determine whether Pitchfork should stay in a closed prison, be transferred to an open prison or be released. If he is not freed after that hearing, his next parole review would be in about two years’ time. A Parole Board spokesman said: “We fully support any recommendations which will allow us to improve the openness and transparency around the Parole Board’s judicial decision-making and improve access to the process for victims.” When questioned on the case in the Commons on Monday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said “this should never happen”. John Cryer, the Labour MP for Leyton and Wanstead, said the release showed there was something “profoundly wrong at the heart of the system” and asked what conversations she was having with the Justice Secretary to make sure such incidents are never repeated. Ms Patel said: “There are a lot of discussions taking place right now, this should never happen.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

John Lewis said it will robustly defend itself against the claims, saying the concept for their advert was presented to them in early  - a year and seven months before Ms Evans published her book.Ms Evans told Lincolnshire Live : Since this advert came out two years ago it has just been a really surreal experience. When the advert was released I was getting lots of messages from people saying that the story reminded them of Fred and initially I just thought it was a coincidence, until I actually saw the advert myself. Fay is now taking legal action against John Lewis and the creative team behind the  advert through the High Courtaposs specialist Intellectual Property Enterprise Court. After serving legal papers on John Lewis, which has now acknowledged theinfringement claim being made against it, the department store chain now has until December  to file a defence. But a spokesperson for John Lewis said: Having provided Ms Evans with the time-stamped documents that show the concept for our Christmas campaign was first presented to us in early  - one year and seven months before her book was published - we are surprised to have received this claim.  But Fay says that these time-stamped documents are utterly irrelevant to her case, as she says that the issue is not when the idea first emerged but about the creative process of transforming the idea into the advert. Fay is currently working with The Lowry theatre in Salford to turn Fred the Fire-Sneezing Dragon into a stage musical, having published her second childrenaposs picture book in . She added: Itaposs kind of soul-destroying to think that someone has used your work because especially as a childrenaposs author, I really have to use my imagination to come up with my stories and so they are a part of me. This is about standing up for creatives everywhere because the experience I went through was heart-breaking and I donapost want anyone  to have to go through it. A John Lewis spokesperson added: We strongly deny that we have copied or drawn any inspiration from the book, and will be robustly defending the claim.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON John LewisChristmas\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Join the Secret Elves for celebration inspiration - and brilliant gt ideas and reviewsSpread the cheer!Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As a result, people are being encouraged to send their gts earlier. This makes it easier for the Royal Mail to process the packages and make sure they arrive on time.Royal Mail says: Allow plenty of time for posting. Please post items and gts for Christmas early, particularly for International deliveries.Ongoing Covid restrictions, reduced air and freight capacity, high volumes and winter weather conditions are all impacting transportation and local delivery across the globe.There was a large increase in packages sent over the Christmas period in  due to lockdown, but the mailing company is expecting a similar demand despite there being no lockdown restrictions this year. So why is Covid- still having an effect on Christmas deliveries  Why is the coronavirus pandemic still affecting deliveries   Last year, people were shut indoors. It meant that wrapping gts and hand-delivering them to loved ones was much more dficult, and people were encouraged to avoid doing this due to lockdown. Instead, people turned more often than normal to using postal services to deliver their gts. We believe the Covid- pandemic resulted in a structural sht, with a permanent step up in the level of parcel volumes compared to pre-pandemic levels, driven by increased online e-commerce activity, the Royal Mail said. It is part of a range of factors that may affect deliveries this Christmas, such as the shortage of HGV drivers. However, Royal Mail CEO Simon Thompson recently said that the shortage of drivers will not affect deliveries this coming Christmas. Due to the increase in packages processed by the company over the festive period, people are being encouraged to send their gts as early as they can.

He says he has never been happierBlair Bowman,  gave up his jet-setting lestyle to protect his sense of smell and taste Image: Blair Bowman   SWNSByHamish MorrisonShiler Mahmoudi:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | comments A man who is terried of losing his sense of smell and taste has been living in self-imposed lockdown since before the UK restrictions came in.Blair Bowman, , a whisky expert, began to limit what he was doing in February  and went into lockdown a couple of weeks before it was imposed nationally.For nearly two years, he and his partner have been living in isolation in their Edinburgh home - and he couldnapost be happier. Blair now only leaves the house for walks and grocery shopping, preferring to use click and collect, which is a stark dference from his normal le.  Blair has travelled all over the world, including Malaysia, Greece, Norway and Turkey, attending business dinners and lunches as a whisky broker.Despite this, he insists that he loves his new lestyle and is able to continue with his job working from home.Blair said: Weaposve both been in this little bubble since the start and made a decision early on to wait for things to blow over.For me the loss of sense of taste and smell was so important and quite a hard-hitting thing that made me decide to be more cautious.About  per cent of how we experience the world is taste and smell, Iaposd really miss being able to taste a nice coffee.Itaposs less about my job and more about how Iaposd enjoy le.There is no point in even drinking whisky because people have told me they can only experience the texture of it and not the flavours.It looks like a large number of people do recover their sense of smell and that gives me a lot of hope.Last summer when Covid was at its lowest levels since the beginning of the pandemic, Blair would get takeaway coffees and meet people at a distance outdoors. But, as the numbers began to creep up again, he decided to go back into lockdown. Blair thinks the short-term benefits of being out donapost outweigh the risks, and that he has been able to move past the feeling of missing out on regular le.When numbers began to rise the couple went back into lockdown, and took social distancing very seriously.While he is living in isolation, he is still able to speak to people from all over the world everyday thanks to technology.Blair said: I know I will have plenty of opportunities to travel, to have dinners and visit new places when I feel ready to do it.Iaposm more content than Iaposve been at any other point in my le. My business is actually excelling and booming.I used to travel internationally - that was a lot of overheads.Obviously I enjoyed it and I look forward to going back to it eventually when I feel comfortable to do so but in one week, I can talk to clients in Japan, India, Europe and the USA and not have to leave my living room.I probably speak to about  people every day on average, so itaposs not like Iaposm actually that shut off.Itaposs not like Iaposm a hermit - itaposs just that I am not doing it in person and thataposs the dference.Blair ensures that he is clued up on Covid statistics to ensure that he is able to make informed decisions about his limits.However, he is yet to meet up with anyone indoors.

From then on he suffered years of intimate, non-physical abuse from someone who aimed to cure his homosexuality. Now Blair - who was left traumatised and suicidal by his treatment - is urging the Scottish Government to criminalise the treatment. The now -year-old still reaps the effects of his distressing experience as he still ‘wakes up in the night screaming’. Conversion therapy involves an attempt to turn an inidualaposs sexual orientation to heterosexual. He was constantly reminded by his family they would ‘watch him being tortured in hell’he ever thought to publicly reveal his sexuality while being forced to read the bible as a aposcureapos. Blair, who is a Scottish Green Party member, was the conversion therapy tactics to be banned to ensure no one  goes through what he went through which left him dealing with PTSD.It comes as The Scottish Government has committed to introducing legislation by the end of  which will end conversion practices as comprehensively as possible within devolved powers. Blair said: I think conversion therapy should be a criminal offence because it is wrong and left me feeling suicidal. “I have been diagnosed with PTSD and take medication to cope with my past as well as cutting off my family completely. “I was threatened as my family said my gran would dieI came out of the closet and was forced to pray to ‘fix me’ which was horrible. “I still wake up in the night screaming from nightmares because of the experience, so I don’t want anyone  to go through it. “The Scottish Government is going to bring a bill around by at least  which could see the treatment I suffered become illegal. “If this legislation had been around when I was younger I would have felt less alone and known what my family were doing was wrong. Blair revealed how his upbringing in a strict Christian household left him ashamed and frustrated with his own sexuality - ultimately being forced to move out and escape at just  years old.  Now he wants to raise awareness that conversion practices ‘don’t come in one form’ and are more common than most people realise. He explained: “Conversion practices aren’t just one type of ‘therapy’ it comes in all dferent ways and is a much bigger problem in Scotland than most people realise. “For me it was all behind closed doors and in secret, my family isolating me and forcing me to suppress myself through religion. “It isn’t just electroshock therapy or gay summer camps like most people think, it is any act of making someone try to change their sexuality. “Having a law introduced by the Scottish Government would highlight the issue and let people understand that conversion therapy isn’t an outdated practice that doesn’t exist anymore, it is still a problem and this would address it.” Blair now works with an End Conversion Therapy movement with others who share similar experiences. The group includes representatives from LGBTI organisations, faith and belief communities, mental health professionals and academics. They aim to work with the Scottish Government to ensure the practice of conversion therapy is no longer allowed. It is anticipated the expert advisory group will begin its work early next year and this, alongside recommendations from the Equalities, Human Rights and Civil Justice Committee and other evidence and research, will inform the Scottish Government’s approach. Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison said: “We are clear about the need to end conversion practices in Scotland – ensuring that everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, is safe from them. These practices are harmful, discriminatory, and have no place in our society. “Work is now underway to establish an expert advisory group on banning conversion therapy and its remit will include recommending an agreed definition of conversion practices. “We will explore how legislation can best protect and support those who need it, while ensuring that freedoms – including freedoms of speech, religion, and belief – are safeguarded.

Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace took the rare step of issuing a joint statement to the broadcaster.The first episode of The Princes And The Press, presented by Amol Rajan, included suggestions that negatives stories about the Duchess of Sussex were leaked by courtiers and there was a competitiveness between their respective households.The second episode, which will be aired next week, is expected to delve into William and Harryaposs rt. Royal aides are reported to be concerned it will include claims the brothers briefed against each other in the press through their advisers. The statement from the palaces said: A free, responsible and open press is of vital importance to a healthy democracy. However, too often it is overblown and unfounded claims from unnamed sources that are presented as facts and it is disappointing when anyone, including the BBC, gives them credibility.It was unclear as to which particular allegations the royal households, who were not given an advance copy of the documentary, were referring to specically.  Monday nightaposs programme also featured Meghanaposs lawyer Jenny Afia, from the law firm Schillings, who responded to reports about the duchessaposs alleged bullying of palace staff. In March, The Times newspaper said the duchess allegedly drove out two personal assistants and humiliated staff on several occasions, which she denies.  An investigation has since been launched by Buckingham Palace and the royal household has tasked an external legal team to assist its human resources team looking at allegations made against the former Suits star. Ms Afia said: Those stories were . This narrative that no one can work for the Duchess of Sussex, she was too dficult and demanding as a boss and everyone had to leave, itaposs just not true. Following the airing of the programme, The Sun reported that William has always banned aides from briefing against family members after seeing the fall-out of his parentsapos media attacks during their split, dubbed the War of the Waleses. The documentary also featured a private investigator who apologised for targeting the phone of Harryaposs former girlfriend Chelsy Davy and admitted he helped rob the prince of his teenage years.  Gavin Burrows, speaking publicly about the issue for the first time, said there had been a ruthless culture in parts of the media in the early s, when he said Miss Davyaposs phone had been under surveillance. Editors told him that putting Harry on the front page sold more copies of newspapers than William. As explained to me by a couple of editors, Harry had basically become the new Diana, he said. The BBC says Mr Burrows is a witness in legal cases against the News of the World and The Sun, but that his claims are yet to be tested in court and are strongly disputed. Mr Burrows said he was very sorry and added: I was basically part of a group of people who robbed himof his normal teenage years.Donapost miss the Mirroraposs regular royal podcast Pod Save The Queen, with royal correspondent Victoria Murphy and host Ann Gripper.Listen on iTunes, Audioboom and your favourite podcast apps.Catch up with Episode  - Royal Wedding Bells for Meghan and Harry.

The condition means his body cannot store fatty tissue underneath the skinDylan Lombard has opened up on his rare condition Image: Dylan Lombard   Caters News AgencyByJoseph BroadyChiara FiorilloNews Reporter:,  Nov | comments A teenager has been diagnosed with a rare condition that means his body cannot store fat, so he can never put on weight.Dylan Lombard, , was born with MDP - Mandibular Hypoplasia, with Deafness and Progeroid Features - but his diagnosis only arrived when he was . He said his mum became worried when he was  months old because he was losing weight, but it took doctors  years to diagnose him because the condition is rare - affecting just  people worldwide. MDP is an extremely rare metabolic disorder that prevents fatty tissue from being stored underneath the skin. It results in a small lower jaw, ears, deafness and tightening of the skin.  Dylan said: I was born with this condition, but it did not become visible until I was  months old. My mum was seeing me drop a lot of weight and became understandably very worried. It took doctoraposs  years in order diagnose me with this condition after constant visits because of its obscurity. There are only  other people in the world who have MDP besides me, but when we got the diagnosis, we were just relieved because we finally knew what it was. The conditionaposs physical effects have meant that Dylan has often experienced people staring or commenting on his appearance.  However, he said he learnt to not let it affect him as he got older. He added: I surround myself with those who support me and love me for who I am which is the best feeling in the world. Dylan now is passionate about spreading awareness of his condition and uses his  to keep the public aware of MDP. He explained: I think I am at a stage in my le where I just really want to help educate people about my condition. I love to tell my story, reach out and connect with people from all around the world. When I do, I honestly believe it makes me stronger and a more confident person.  Due to MDP, Dylan is not able to do take part in many physical activities such as contact sports, but he managed to find his passion at the age of  in photography. Dylan explained:I was out walking on a rainy day and took a few pictures on my phone to show my parents which they were really amazed by. They encouraged me to take more, and I have been snapping ever since. At , my mum bought me my first camera and I havenapost looked back since, photography is just the most incredible thing to me.  Dylan takes his inspiration from his city, capturing the essence of Glasgow through his perception.He added: The weather may not be the best, but I love living in Scotland. I am certainly Glaswegian and proud, and I love showing what my city has to offer.When I take a photo, it stays with me forever and that feeling is just indescribable. Dylan believes that everybody, no matter who they are, has the ability to be the best version of themselves. He said: I am a lot more than just my condition, which is why I feel it is so important to share my story. Nobody should ever be afraid of who they are, and it is important to just keep doing what makes you happy. Perseverance is key, never give up.

I ended up having four doses off a chemo drug that saved my le my heart started again.Amy is now feeling much better and hoping tohome to her daughter and fiance Charlie.  She needed a heart transplant due to suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle where it becomes stretched and thin. This means her heart is unable to pump blood around the body effectively. Amy has been taking medication since she was diagnosed with the condition aged eight. Last December, Amy discovered she was pregnant and was informed by doctors that she could no longer take her heart tablets due to the risk to her unborn babyaposs health. When she was  weeks into her pregnancy, her health took a turn and she was required to stay in hospital and needed a pacemaker.Ivy Rae was born in June through a cesarean section due to Amyaposs declining health.Amy said: Doctors came to me on the th and saidthey didnapost bring Ivy Rae the next day I wouldnapost have made it, my body was too weak my heart was failing massively. Two days after giving birth, Amy was fitted with a pacemaker and was able to go home, but she was brought back to hospital six weeks later after falling ill from a blood clot. After being rushed into surgery for a le-saving biventricular assist device, fitted to help pump blood around her body as her heart was failing, Amy was put on the urgent transplant list in September. A donor match was found but after undergoing the transplant, Amyaposs antibodies began attacking her new heart and she was on le support for  days. It was unlikely at that time that she would survive, but she was able to somehow make a recovery.  She recalls waking up one day attached to wires and medical equipment and the medication she was on meant that she didnapost even recognise her fiance. Since her unexpected recovery, she is slowly working towards feeling herself again, and is currently in hospital learning to walk again for the third time. She feels hopeful that she will be able to get home to her family soon. Amy has emphasised the importance of having an organ donor register, which all people in the UK are now automatically enrolled onto unless they opt out. She added: I really think people should be on the organ donor list asit wasnapost for a kind soul being a donor I wouldnapost be here today and I wouldnapost have had the chance to watch my daughter grow.

As the potential increases for more wet weather and impacts from rainfall and wind, Brits are being encouraged to make themselves aware of their own flood risk.The Environment Agency is reminding people they can check the flood risk attached to their property online, sign up for warnings, andthey are at risk, know what to doflooding hits their home. The call comes at the start of Flood Action Week, as the agency disclosed findings from a survey which suggested three-fthsof households in flood-risk areas did not believe their property could be affected. While % of households in at-risk areas had taken some steps to prepare for their home flooding, % had done nothing.  If replicated across England, this could mean as many as . million homes at risk of flooding are unprepared. Will Lang, head of civil contingencies at the Met Office, said iability was the defining characteristic of UK winters, with a mix of all types of weather. Such changeability has already been seen since the end of summer, with some flooding this autumn and a cold snap hitting this week. But he said that looking at the big global drivers which impact weather in the UK, such as the La Nina climate pattern in the Pacic, showed indications that the winter could see more prevalence of systems coming in from the Atlantic with milder, wetter and sometimes windier conditions. The outlook also shows an above average chance of a milder than normal winter - which he said was in line with warmer winters driven by climate change.  Cold weather spells and impacts such as snow do remain possible, and these cold weather impacts are more likely during the first half of the period, up until Christmas, Mr Lang said. There is a higher chance overall than normal of wet conditions, and also that implies that there is a higher likelihood of impacts from rainfall and indeed from winds, especially later in the period, January and beyond that, he said. The EA estimates . million properties in England are at risk from floods. Those at risk are urged to follow advice to protect themselves by packing medicines, insurance and other documentsthere is a flood alert, and visit the flood warning information service. If there is a flood warning, those potentially affected should act by moving family, pets and belongings to safety, and turn off gas, water and electricity. If there is a severe flood warning, those affected are encouraged to survive immediate danger by following the advice of emergency services or calling needed.  The Environment Agencysaid it has  mobile pumps and , trained staff ready to take action to protect communities from flooding this winter, while construction and repair of flood defences has also continued throughout the year. In late October, when parts of the country saw a monthaposs worth of rain in  hours, some  households were flooded but more than , properties were protected by flood defences and action the EA took, it said. But Caroline Douglass, executive director of flooding at the Environment Agency, warned it was now the time to be “vigilant”, rather than complacent, about flooding. She said the EAaposs previous investment programme protected , properties from flooding, defences helped protect nearly , properties during floods since  and the organisation was investing millions in building new schemes and making repairs to keep communities safe. But she warned that climate change was happening, increasing the frequency and intensity of storms, pointing to Storm Christoph and other recent storms in the past few years which broke records for rainfall or river levels, as well as the deadly flooding in parts of Europe this year. We canapost prevent all flooding - climate change is only increasing that risk - and todayaposs figures show that while some people are prepared, many are not. Itaposs vitally important for the public to go online and checkthey are at risk, sign up for Environment Agency warnings, and know what to doflooding hits, she said. There was also a warning for drivers - as just cmof flowing water is enough to float a car. Tony Rich, from the AA, urged drivers to allow plenty of time for journeys during heavy rainfall as roads could quickly become impassable, and to leave twice as much space from the car in front to allow for greater stopping distances. He said: Drivers should take extra care where roads dip, for example under bridges, as these areas are more likely to flood. Floodwater can be deceptively deep, and it doesnapost take much for water to get sucked into your engine. It can also mask other hazards in the road, such as displaced manhole covers, soin doubt turn around and find another route.

Plan B,introduced, is a measure to try and bring cases down, but health secretary Sajid Javid is playing down the chances of it happening.Experts are also calling for some restrictive measures to increase social distancing to be reintroduced across the UK, with the seven-day average for cases across the UK now around the , mark. Countries around the world are also experiencing a rise in cases. German chancellor Angela Merkel admitted the country is in the midst of a new wave, while Austria began a ten-day lockdown on Monday. Boris Johnson currently has no plans to do the same, but what would plan B look like What would closeCovid Plan B was introduced   While Plan B is a measure to reduce Covid cases in the UK, it would not lead to shops and hospitality businesses being forced to close again. According to the government policy paper published in September, Plan B will prioritise measures which can help control transmission of the virus while seeking to minimise economic and social impact. Lockdown meant that a huge hit to the economy occurred as many dferent businesses and sectors had to shut down completely, while staff were furloughed. Plan B will, however, recommend that people work from home rather than the office, where possible, so some businesses may choose to temporarily close their offices, but bars and restaurants are unlikely to choose to do this. Working from home will be familiar to those who experienced this during the lockdown, as will the use of masks in public places like shops and on public transport. Would restaurants, bars and shops remain open during Covid Plan B   Shops, bars and restaurants are likely to remain open under Covid Plan B, with no plans from the government to close them. However, Plan B may discourage people for going out and and visiting bars and restaurants and, while it is currently speculation, some in the hospitality sector have warned against the plans. UKHospitality CEO Kate Nicholls told the Independent in October: We lost Christmas in its entirety last year, so it’s desperately important for survivability, getting you through the bleak months of January and February when people don’t come out as much. The government would be keen not to see such a hit to its economy and local economies across the UK with the introduction of Plan B measures. A leaked government document revealed that Plan B could cost the country £ million every week. The analysis was drawn up by the Cabinet Office’s Covid- task force and the Treasury, but does not seem to factor the cost on the NHS. The governmentaposs Plan B document also states: The Government recognises this causes more disruption and has greater immediate costs to the economy and some businesses than the other Plan B interventions, so a final decision would be made based on the data at the time. So, depending on case numbers, deaths and transmission rates, the government may change the Plan B measures closer to the time. Face coverings will become mandatory and a legal requirement again, but the government has not outlined exactly where you would need to wear these yet and guidelines may well include wearing masks in restaurants, bars and shops. What  does the governmentaposs Covid Plan B involve   Like shops, face coverings will also have to be worn on public transport, as well as in hospitalsthe measures are introduced. The public will be clearly communicated to regularly by the government and people will be encouraged to act more cautiously. College and secondary school staff and pupils will also have to test regularly to seethey have Covid. A contingency framework exists for schools, where cases are monitored locally and compulsory mask-wearing may be reintroduced,need be. There may also be mandatory aposvaccine-onlyapos Covid status certications brought in, in certain settings liked nightclubs, crowded indoor and ious outdoor events with , or more attendees like football matches.

Beth Clyde,  was diagnosed with Hogkin’s Lymphoma just days before the first lockdown in March , Glasgow Live reports.Leading up to her le-changing diagnosis, Beth had a bad cough, sore throat and was struggling with extreme fatigue. Following a trip to the doctors for an X-ray on her lung and a biopsy, it was discovered she had tumours. Beth said: “I remember being confused, and initially I was overwhelmed and upset, but then after I had time to digest it I was relieved to have an answer. I’d felt so bad for so long and I was worried I was going crazy.  “My friends and family were devastated, but were trying to be a strong support network for me. I told my mum to tell meshe was upset or worried and she said no, but I think she was hiding how she felt because she wanted to protect me.”Beth from Glasgow was required to undergo  rounds of gruelling chemotherapy beginning in April last year, but due to the coronavirus restrictions at that time, she could not have any family or friends visiting her. However, her friends came to see her at her window and dropped off small gts at her door to lt her spirits. The chemotherapy also had a number of side-effects that were dficult to endure, such as severe fatigue, hair loss and neuropathy.She also suffered with a horrying ten-day battle with le-threatening sepsis after a bacterial infection seven months in, which saw her body temperature rise to a concerning C.It was the worst experience Iaposve ever had, she said. I was so sick because my immune system was so low. I was hallucinating due to my brain heating up. I even saw Death in the corner of the room. It was was brutal. I had to wait to get better before I started chemo again.  Beth said that the moments she remembered the most however was the kindness and chit chat she received from staff and volunteers. She fondly recalls how members of hospital staff, from medics to the porters, would visit her bedside and talk to her. “Someone always sat and made sure I was okay. Not having my friends and family around shone a light on how amazing the NHS are, she said. Everyone just chats away to you and keeps you occupied. That got me through when I was feeling lonely.When she wasnapost in hospital, Beth spent lockdown at home shielding with her mum, who had taken time off from her job as a social worker. Beth added: “I spent a lot of time during lockdown cleaning my room and drawers! But there were days I was too tired and I’d stay in bed or lie on the couch. We sat in the garden a lot during the summer. I’m so glad I had somewhere to go other than the house. It helped it go much quicker. My mental health was okay – I knew I had a goal to get to with my health. so I was concentrating on that.”  On October , , Beth and her mum were brought in and told by the doctor that she was in full remission. “It’s wild the relief I felt – I was so happy and couldn’t stop smiling. My mum was so emotional too. It was the best day ever. It made me realise how much I have overcome. “We couldn’t do much to celebrate due to lockdown, so we got a Chinese takeaway afterwards.” In the year since, Beth has been living her le to the full. She donned her graduation robes for photos at her university after the ceremony last year was cancelled due to covid. She has ed to her part-time job, is back training in the gym and heads up town for nights out with her pals at the weekend. She even threw a party with  friends and family at pub The Locale at Charing Cross to mark a year in remission last month. “It has been so emotional being back with everyone again. It’s so nice to have a bit of normality – it’s crazy how much you want it when you don’t have it for a year. I’m really lucky. “Ive got four years to go before I’m officially cancer-free, but I’m doing well and not on any medication.” The -year-old has urged Glaswegians to back the Beatson Cancer Charity this Christmas – as you’ll never know when you or a loved one will need it. “It’s the best wee centre in the world and it was my second home in  – for people from all over Scotland.

The fitness fanatic, who goes by the name @marzil on TikTok, was horried when she rewatched the video sheaposd taken to study her workout form.As the clip starts, it shows her in front of a mirror, partially bending down near some heavy dumbbells on the floor. Her phone was behind her, propped up on a piece of equipment.The video - which has been viewed two million times since being shared on TikTok last week - then shows a man walking in front of the camera with his gym bag, partially blocking the shot.He places his bag on the floor, and as he does, the womanaposs camera shows his screen - which was focused on her bum. The man asks her a question, and she answers, sorry, no youaposre fine, before rushing back to pick up her phone. It wasnapost until she checked the video in her car that she noticed the man appeared to be filming her. She captioned the video: Iaposm disgusted. I was recording myself but it looks like I wasnapost the only one. She posted the video with hashtags, including #wtf, #gymfail, #whatdoido. In a follow-up video, the woman explained what had happened: So what basically happened was I was working out and taking a video of myself to see my progress and my form.  So I set up my camera, my phone against a machine and this man walked by. And I was like, aposoh I need to move itapos, because itaposs in his way. So I apologised and said, aposoh no youaposre fineapos, but little did I know he was recording me. So it wasnapost until I was done working out and I came into my car and I rewatched my video and realised that he was in fact recording me. I felt so disgusted, my stomach literally dropped. Heaposs lucky I was running late for work otherwise I wouldaposve ran in there and been like, aposWhat the hell apos The TikToker said she reported the incident to a manager at the gym, and that they are going to try identying him with security camera footage. The manager also said they would file a report once heaposs been identied. TikTok users were outraged after seeing the clip. She was recording HERSELF, not him, one wrote. He had no right to record her. This is why I donapost feel comfortable going to the gym, another said. They need an all female gym.

But, there are few people who are as committed as one Christmas mad mum, who turns her entire home into a Santaaposs grotto, by covering every single wall in festive wrapping paper. Carly Lockie started the unusual tradition two years ago, when she grew tired of the beige walls in her three-bedroom Bristol home, so she decided to go for the full Christmas transformation, on a budget.She enlists the help of her partner Mike Phillips, as well as her kids, -year-old Mayah, Harmonie, , five-year-old Junior, and stepdaughter Kayleigh, , to hang the paper in every room in the house - including all the doors and even the kitchen cupboards.  Carly said: We do the whole house and it takes a long time. We start the first week of November and finish in the first week of December. Itaposs like Santaaposs grotto. I just love Christmas and so does Mike. Heaposs just as barmy a me so weaposre on the same wave . Everyone I know loves it but they also think Iaposm batty. Iaposve got a few bah humbugs in my family so they think Iaposm crazy. The younger kids love it and they bring their friends round to have a look. Mayah pretends not to because she doesnapost want to ruin her street cred but she wants her room done too.

The -year-old covers her entire home using  rolls of wrapping paper, which cost just p each, meaning her whole house is completely transformed for a modest £. Carly said: We used two rolls per wall in the living room but the bedrooms are a bit smaller. I find the cheapest wrapping paper at p a roll. The walls were just plain before, a bland magnolia. Itaposs great because when I take it down, it feels like weaposve just redecorated it again. The wrapping paper stays up until the nd or rd of Jan and it doesnapost take it too long. Traditionally, the family would begin the decorating towards the end of November but decided to start earlier this year in memory of Carlyaposs mum, Roz, who passed away in . Carly said: My mum bought us a Christmas tree last year and it arrived the day after she died so now we decorate the house a week earlier in tribute to her. It was the last present she ever bought us. The decorations are taken down after the New Year but the thrty mum makes sure nothing goes to waste by making Christmas cards out of the used paper. Carly said: We never throw any away. Nothing goes to waste. All of last yearaposs wrapping paper was used to make Christmas cards for the elderly because there are a lot of care homes in our area. We keep the cardboard bit in the middle and just wrap it back around that and put it in storage to use for next year.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

In fact, the TikToker couldnapost quite believe her eyes when her ex replied: Where are you  Can I come to you  I couldnapost say it before and Iaposm sorry, but Iaposve always loved you. The clip ended with Laleh revealing her ex was coming to see her, and thank goodness, she later uploaded a follow up clip explaining all the juicy details from the visit. She explained: So here’s the thing: he came over last night. We talked about a lot, but he left because it was so late. He came over so late, so I was like: aposYou have to go.apos And also because I just needed to be with my own thoughts. Laleh did add, however, that the pair had plans to go to dinner the following night, and promised to keep all her eager followers in the loop. In a follow up video, Laleh provided a bit of context explaining that she and her ex dated a while ago, but things didnapost work out because, at the time, he was emotionally unavailable. From our conversation I got the idea that maybe he was available to things now and he asked me out to dinner and obviously I was very excited, she explained. So, we go out to dinner and weaposre talking and itaposs just really nice to hear a lot of the things I had validated for myself in the emotional process of not seeing him anymore. It was really good to hear him say all those things and communicate them really well, in a way that he wasnapost able to do when we were seeing each other. The ex went on to tell Laleh that he was so glad to have been able to clear the air as it had played on his mind, before dropping the ultimate bombshell and telling her he was soon to be moving abroad. He was like Iaposve taken a job abroad, Iaposm leaving after Thanksgiving, she added, before mimicking herself stabbing herself in the heart. Although she was clearly very upset and had been hoping for something more, Laleh said it was a beautul thing to have been able to get the closure she needed from the relationship.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

I was so upset that a parent felt it was acceptable to threaten my seven-year-old child, Beth @bethgillelandexplained in a clip posted to her TikTok account.However, after speaking to the bus driver about the incident, the mum was left feeling broken when she learned that not only had her son knocked the boyaposs glasses off intentionally, heaposd also been pushing him around the bus. He explained to me that this child is heavy set and he canapost get off the bus quickly, the mum continued. He then told me how my child was shoving this boy down the aisle because he wasnapost moving aposfast enoughapos. This boy turned to my son and politely told him aposIaposm going as fast as I canapos. My child ripped his glasses off and threw them to the back of the bus. After being horried at this new information, Beth decided to visit the little boyaposs home, where she discovered that the childaposs father hadnapost threatened him at all. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.  I was so bullied in school for my weight and I donapost condone this behaviour and it is not tolerated. I donapost know where to go from here, Iaposm obviously doing something wrong, she said, before adding: My child is apologising tomorrow and we have invited him over to play. In another clip, the mum directly apologised to the little boy, who she described as the sweetest little boy sheaposd ever met. After posting the videos, Beth was met with a lot of support from other parents, who reassured her it wasnapost her fault, and thanked for her for trying to make the situation right. Holding your son accountable and having him apologise, and then also encouraging him to see the other child as a person, as a friend, thataposs A+ parenting, one TikTok user commented. Another added: The fact you investigated, listened and corrected the behaviour means youaposre doing something right.

In a video titled “My husband said he would clean the house while I take the kids out”, Chrissy could be seen going around her house and picking out spots that she could check for signs of cleaning later – by leaving piles of glitter. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Chrissy left three piles of glitter around her house which she then cleverly covered with items such as candles and jars so that she could lt the items when she got home to checkthe glitter had been wiped away. The following day, Chrissy posted another video where she showed the results of her test – and the experiment had mixed findings. The first pile of glitter, which was covered by a candle placed on a windowsill, had been smudged but was not completely clean. The second pile – located on a shelving unit and hidden under an air freshener – was left untouched.  But her husband redeemed himself in the end, as the third pile in the kitchen was absolutely spotless. And people in the comments of the videos – which have a combined  million views – are torn, as many of them have admitted they also don’t move items when dusting down surfaces. One person said: “Iaposm going to be honest,something is in its designated spot, I donapost move it to clean. But Iaposll admit Iaposm lazy.” While another wrote: “I rarely move things when cleaning unless it needs it. None of those looked like it needed to be moved.” But others on TikTok hit back insisting those who don’t move items need to learn how to clean all over again as they’re not “cleaning properly”. Someone posted: “Let’s just put this straight - you’re not cleaning properlyyou’re not moving things to clean the surfaces!” As another said: “You’re all acting like it’s so much effort to lt a candle and wipe under it. That’s not a deep clean.” And a third added: “First wrong move - they don’t move things when they clean! At least they clean though.” Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Eduardo Melendez, from Honduras, shared a spine-tingling clip which sees him walking towards the disabled cubicle at the end of the bathroom.According to the Daily Star, the TikTok user then looks right next to the toilet bowl and discovers a wall with exposed concrete on the left, with a paper sign inside the wall which reads: Enter. That is seriously spooky. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the clip, which has since been viewed more than  million times, sparked huge conversation in the comments, with many comparing it to a prison break, like something out of a Netflix series.

Someone pulled an El Chapo at the school, one follower commented, while another added: The school is the jail and itaposs going to be easy to skip now. In a follow up clip, Eduardo revealed what was inside the opening and what the sign was directing him to, as the camera revealed a secret room, which appeared to be hidden in complete darkness. There is nothing, he said, but not everyone agreed, with some followers swearing they noticed someone  there. No one saw a hand and sleeve where the enter sign is  one asked while another added: There is a hand under the paper that says aposenterapos you can see the fingers! And others were freaked out when they spotted what they claimed to be a face in the dark. You can’t tell me you don’t see the face,one viewer wrote, while another commented: Right at the end, looks like eyes peaking around the corner.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

A festive performance was thrown into chaos on Monday night when dozens of people suddenly plunged several metres downwards in Joinville city in Santa Catarina, Southern Brazil. A paved walkway over a river had fallen through under the weight of the crowd. The incident happened during the opening of the Natal Cultural, a traditional event in the city. Video from the scene shows people wearing Father Christmas hats running in a panic towards the crater before helping people out onto the road. The hole appears to be four or five metres across, several metres wide and at least two metres deep.Eleven children were rushed to Joinville Childrenaposs Hospital for treatment for cuts and bruises,  Minutos reported.  Firefighters said they took one child to hospital with traumatic brain injuries, but this has not been confirmed. Nineteen adults were treated at the Municipal Hospital São José de Joinville. Technicians from the Civil Defense and the Infrastructure Department carried out an inspection of the site, but were unable to work out why the pavement gave way.  Three ambulances and  fire fighters were rushed to the scene and helped at least  people out of the hole. Ricardo Korb, who lives in Joinville, . “Fathers, mothers with children in their arms fell. It was about  meters high and stopped on the riveraposs mud”.  Witness Cristiane Sampaio added: “Just as we were watching the countdown, there was a noise.

She is now the proud mum of twins Chloe and Freya, threeManda Epton during her pregnancy Image: Mercury Press  Media Ltd.ByJade CulverChiara FiorilloNews Reporter:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | comments A woman spent £, on fertility treatment and became a mum to twins at the age of .Manda Epton, , spent  years going through  fertility treatments and had three miscarriages before she was finally successful.The woman, living in Sydney, Australia, had always dreamt of having a family of her own and when her long-term relationship turned sour, she embarked on a fertility journey alone.The fashion designer, originally from Oxford, UK, is now the proud mum of twins Chloe and Freya, three, after spending over £,in treatments. Manda said: I started doing treatments when I was , as Iaposd always dreamt of having a family. I continued dating over the  years but always felt this pressure as I still wanted children.  I decided to do it alone with the help of a sperm donor and egg donor through IVF. I started burning through my income and savings at fertility clinics. One of the clinics referred me to a psychotherapist who told me that I needed to come to terms with the fact that I would never have children at .Manda underwent two and a half rounds of IVF, as the third was cancelled due to oian hyperstimulation - an exaggerated response to excess hormones, which is a rare complication of IVF, according to the NHS.The mum had six embryos implanted and had two pregnancies that lasted eight weeks.She also had six IUI drug-assisted fertility rounds and seven IUI-only rounds all of which were unsuccessful, despite another eight-week pregnancy. Her final round of fertility at Cape Town SA, Cape Fertility, included a double donor embryo transfer which resulted in her successful twin pregnancy. She added: I struggled with the miscarriages and part of me wanted to give up at points, but I really wanted children of my own. I even thought about adoption, but the waiting list was seven years, and single women were at the bottom of the list. After witnessing her struggle, a friend recommended Manda visit Cape Fertility in South Africa. Not only had her friend had a successful pregnancy from the clinic, but it was much cheaper than what Manda was paying per treatment in Australia.  She said: I got to choose the donors and got to shop around. I come from a blonde hair and blue eyes background so chose a lovely egg donor from South Africa and got to shop around for a sperm donor, eventually choosing one from Denmark. I spent £,at the clinic and had two embryos transferred, as it was my final chance and I really wanted at least one of them to be successful. I was in the stirrups like Bridget Jones during the procedure. After her time in South Africa, Manda travelled back to her home in Australia, crossing her fingers unsureher pregnancy would be successful. She said: I went to my seven-week scan, genuinely worried that I would miscarry again after I had a hematoma bleed between the amniotic sacks. But my eyes almost popped out of my head when the woman pointed out that there were two babies.The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

She added: I was quite sick for the first five months of the pregnancy and had non-stop vomiting, and being an older woman, I had a lot of injections to help me along too. But both my girls came out perfectly happy and healthy. Manda now spends as much time as possible with her daughters, claiming that being an older mum has many perks. She said: I feel as though, at , Iaposm a bit wiser and donapost do technology the way younger parents do these days. So Iaposm out here spending more time playing with them at the park and doing fun activities, rather than ignoring them and being on my phone. Being freelance, and having my own business Maud N Lil Organic Cotton where we make organic comforters and soft toys for children, means I can spend as much time with them as I can. Itaposs the best decision Iaposve ever made.

Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

It forms part of a wider poundm investment into neurodegenerative diseases which devastate so many families across the Borders.ldquoI am proud to have played a part in pushing for this investment. However, it is the tireless campaigning of Doddie Weir who has raised the profile of this awful disease and raised millions of pounds in the process through his charity that has made this all possible.ldquoHis bravery and determination in the face of adversity has been awe inspiring when he could have so easily given up.ldquoThe UK is a global leader in medical research and this investment will keep our brightest and best scientists at the forefront of the battle to find a cure."},{"url":null,"title":"f","story":"Eighteen Bordersbars andpubsfeature inThe Good Beer Guide , which details some of the best spots for beer around the UK.Published by CAMRA, the  release marks the th edition recommendingthousands of places for a pint in regions across the country, alongside detailed descriptionsof the pub and often examples of the beers onoffer.Each venue in the book has been visited by an expert volunteer, who consider both the beer on offer as well as atmosphere and location.Heres what you need to know about the Borders pubs that feature in The Good Beer Guide ...Which Borders pubsfeature in The Good Beer Guide  Allanton Inn -

changes in behaviour are offset by a build-up of population immunity.\"Projections are however based on the same family of models used in spring, which did not perform well - predicting a substantial summer surge that didnrsquot really arise.\": Vaccine passports in Europe brought people back to hospitalityThe expert group voiced concern that while the highly-transmissible Delta iant is currently outcompeting other iants - even those with \"immune escape\"mutations - there is still the possibility that it could be overtaken by another strain.The minutes state: \"While there was some reason to be optimistic, it was noted that there is room for evolution of the virus and we must not be complacent.\"Delta is currently outcompeting other iants with immune escape, but the virus had demonstrated signicant evolutionary tendencies and new iants could change that.\"There is genuine scientic credibility about the possibilities for greater transmission ndash some existing iants are more transmissible than Delta.\"There was an acknowledgement that the UK was at a high equilibrium compared to the EU and there is the possibility of a lsquodelta plusrsquo iant arising from high case rates, with the potential for vaccine escape.\"The Delta plus iant - also known as Delta AY.. - is a sub-iant of Delta which made up % of UK positive samples in the week ending November .The most recent evidence, published last Thursday by researchers at Imperial College London, indicates that it is more likely to cause asymptomatic infections and is around  per cent more infectious.However, they said it \"does not appear to dfer\" from the original Delta in any serious way - such as causing more severe illness or being more resistant to vaccines, though its increased transmissibility could lead it to overtake its predecessor.The Scottish Governments Covid- advisors stressed that vaccinations remain the \"main tool\" for battling the pandemic, and that this must include a focus on \"catch-up\" vaccinations to immunise iniduals who have never come forward for the jag at all as well as boosters to counteract fading immunity.Scotland experienced a surge after schools ed in August but, in England, cases have been high but comparatively even since the end of JulyThey also note the puzzle of why England has not experienced a signicant surge in cases since the summer, in contrast to Scotland, despite the Scottish Government retaining restrictions such as facemasks and home-working where possible.: Vaccines were supposed to get le back to normal - so why are scientists talking of lockdowns until  They state: \"Scotland and England have been in tandem for most of the pandemic but not since around the time of the Euros. Infections in Scotland peaked, then declined without intervention and are now plateauing.\"There is an unresolved question as to why England did not peak to the same extent. It may be because things are so delicate that small movements have produced big changes.\"High levels of infectiousness and high levels of vaccination is new territory but the infectiousness of Delta means that we cannot attain population [herd] immunity.\"The spike in neonatal deaths in September is being investigatedThe paper also noted that  members ProfessorAziz Sheikh, of Edinburgh University, and Professor Chris Robertson, of Strathclyde University, areto engage with the UK SAGE expert group regarding data on pregnancy and COVID-.The minutes note that \"vaccination rates for pregnant women are low, with pregnant women sadly making up a signicant proportion of those admitted to hospital with COVID-\", but added thatthere is also \"little published evidence on vaccination during pregnancy\".It comes after an investigation was launched into an abnormal spike in neonatal deaths in Scotland during September, when  infants died within  days of birth."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-people-resent-scotland-parliament","story":"I think it is clear from her previous contributions that Ms Stephenson is not a fan of the SNP.

Game over.John Dunlop, Ayr.FALSE POSITIVES IN PCR TESTSI AGREE with all of Joanna Blythmanrsquos points when she criticises Nicola Sturgeonrsquos recent moves on Covidbut I would like to emphasize a more signicant issue, that of PCR tests.PCR tests are the linchpin justication for government action on covid. A critical part of PCR is the Ct , and this is the number of amplications required to create enough DNA for analysis from a sample from a patient.Information on what Ct values are being used by testing labs has been sparse or non-existent, but a  study lead-authored by I Engelmann reports that labs often use Ct values provided by PCR kit manufacturers which are between  and  cycles.A more accurate method of diagnosis for Covid would be to take a sample from a suspected Covid patient and attempt to culture it inside cells, but this would be too time-consuming for mass screening of millions of people.Engelmann cites a  study lead-authored by J Bullard, where diagnostics were carried out on samples from PCR-Covid-positive patients by way of culturing. Bullard concludes: ldquoOur study showed no positive viral cultures with a Ct greater than .If, as this suggests, most positive test results are  positives then the government needs to radically rethink its covid response.Geoff Moore, Alness.SCOTS TORIES AND THE DEMOCRATIC WILLTHE distressing pictures from the Netherlands and Austria must surely act as a salutary lesson for Douglas Ross and the Scottish Tories.Of course, restrictions on our liberty are unwelcome, but measures taken by the Scottish Government are for our protection.

McDonald, Glasgow.RETURN OF HERD IMMUNITYI WAS astonished to hear the UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid claim at the weekend that ldquoEngland has the lsquoright measuresrsquo in place to curb infections.Askedthe government should be dusting off its Plan B and bringing in vaccine passports and mandatory requirements to wear face coverings, Mr Javid stated that he agreed with the Prime Minister that there was ldquonothing in the data that suggested the government should move forwards with Plan B.He went on to criticise other countries in Europefor not following the UK lead and ending Covid restrictions sooner.With UK infections now running at some , in each of the last few weeks, I find Mr Javidrsquos assertion that the UK is doing well quite extraordinary.It is as though the UK government is now deliberately pursuing a policy of lsquoherd immunityrsquo and thus wilfully exposing thousands of our fellow citizens to infection and adding yet more pressure on our over-stretched NHS.I find this truly shocking.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh.NO CALL FOR FURTHER COVID PASSPORTSIMPLEMENTATION of the Scottish Covid passport system has had very little effect on younger Scots getting the jab, which serves to undermine Nicola Sturgeonrsquos plan to extend the passport system this week.There is now absolutely no justication in extending the passport system further and putting the hospitality industry in Scotland under threat of financial collapse.Dennis Forbes Grattan, Aberdeen.INTEGRATING HEALTH AND CARE SERVICESHENRY McLeish states that ldquoyou have to separate the hotel aspect of [residential care] from the care side when arguing about the need for free nursing and care world first, insists ex-FM, November .That comment could equally apply to the situation in hospital care where aspects of the service provided could be classed as hotel aspects.In integrating services, does this then give the government the opportunity to introduce hotel charges for hospital services And would this be seen as a more affordable than the alternative of providing free residential care in either residential care homes or nursing homes Interesting times and challenges ahead for the integration of health and care services, where a level playing field across both will be required ndash or, no doubt, legal challenges will follow.Bill Eadie, Gfnock."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13230977.jpg?type=article-full","title":"best-online-casinos-australia-real-money-pokies-table-games","story":"Wersquoll be walking you through each site and explaining what works and what doesnrsquot work about it, and wersquoll also be answering your most popular questions related to online gambling in Australia at the end of the article.Letrsquos start.

As well as food sharing, Community Fridges give people opportunities to contribute through volunteering, learning new skills and sharing their existing skills.#Jane Nelson, chair of Greener Orkney, said: #Although the project will start small, we intend it to grow and estimate we will eventually need twenty volunteers to open and close the fridge each day, collect food from suppliers, and ensure the area is clean and tidy.

The current bus service impacts are:  Junction Road will be closed between Castle Streetand Tankerness Lane . Public Bus services affected are X,,,,,S and . Buses will turn left out of Travel Centre, left at Kiln Corner Roundabout, left at the Ayre Roundabout onto Great Western Road, rejoining routes on Pickaquoy Road .Works are planned for Outertown Road, Stromness, starting on Monday, November  to Thursday, December .Meanwhile, folk can expect roadworks on the A junction with Gorseness Road , on Friday, December  and Saturday .Roadworkers will be heading to the B road on Shapinsay between Housebay Cottage and Howe Farm, from Tuesday, December  to Thursday .On Monday and Tuesday - December, roadworks are planned for Old Finstown Road between Zions Loan and Kingsdale.The A St Mary’s, corner at The Inn, will be subject to roadworks from Monday, December  to Friday . The work is programmed to last for up to five days and will be carried out under road closure conditions in order for the folks involved to be as safe as possible. To reduce the impact of this, the closures will be restricted to am to .pm which should enable school transport to operate with a minimum of disturbance.Outwith the road closure times traffic will be restricted to using one side of the road and will be controlled by temporary traffic lights which will result in delays during busier periods.A ersion route will be in place via the Aand the B from St Andrews Primary School to the First Churchill Barrier.Stagecoach has advised that during the hours of am – :pm, the X commercial service from St Margarets Hope to Kirkwall will ert via the Kirkwall to Deerness road past St Andrews Primary School to the First Barrier and on to St Margaret’s Hope as per the existing timetable. Due to the change of route and possible disruptions, OIC asks passengers to allow   minutes on current scheduled times as there are likely to be delays.During the period of closure, there will be an additional X service in operation from Kirkwallas per the current timetable which will serve as far as St Marys and back for passengers residing in the Holm area. Therefore, the pick up  drop off point for passengers will be from Park of Ayre and therefore there will be no service between the First Barrier and Park of Ayre during the period of closure.Posters notying passengers of the ersions will be placed on the X service, Kirkwall Travel Centre and affected bus shelters. It should be noted that passengers can track buses across Orkney on the Stagecoach App which would provide accurate timings.OIC apologises for the inconvenience this will cause during the period of road closure. For further information on the X timetable during this time please contact Stagecoach on   or visitwww.orkney.gov.uk transport for timetable information.As for the council#s flagstone repairs, the works on John Street have been completed, with all barriers and signs now removed and the section reopened, today, Friday, November .In Victoria Street, from Bank Lane towards its junction with Ferry Road at the fountain works have been completed and reinstatements are curing with barriers expected to be removed next week.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

The  year old lorry driver, from Aghay, Crosskeys, raised pound, for Marie Curie this year, bringing his overall fundraising total to pound,. James has participated in the Annual Belfast Marathon Walk for the last  years.He initially set out to raise money and awareness for the NHS after finding himself admitted to hospital following a serious health condition. When released, he decided to put his best foot forward at the Marathon as a way to say thank you to the NHS staff who cared for him during his hospital stay.James told the : “I’ve completed the Belfast Marathon Walk for the past  years.“It’s around eight or nine miles and any money raised goes straight to local causes and charities.“I’ve raised money for around  charities, including Turning Point in Ballymena, the Macmillan Cancer Unit, Mencap, the Kidney Unit at Antrim Area Hospital as well as Causeway and City Hospital.“This is my second time donating funds to Marie Curie and I usually try to pick a dferent charity each year.“I found myself in hospital a decade ago and I needed to have an operation. “The care I received from the staff was fantastic and I decided to complete the first Marathon Walk simply as a way of thanking them for helping me get back on my feet again.“As each year went by, I kept going and tried to help a dferent charity along the way. For example, a neighbour inspired me to donate to Macmillan Cancer Care.“I then chose a number of local charities so that all money raised goes to local causes to help local people.“I have now acquired  medals for each completed Walk and raised thousands which will hopefully be of some help to these deserving charities. “The Walks take me around two hours, five minutes - and what’s two hours, five minutes when you can use it to do some good.”TRUCK SHOWAs a trucker, James’ driving career has helped him get involved with a number of other fundraising activities.He explained: “Around  years ago, I was in Irvinestown, Fermanagh, where I heard about an upcoming Truck Show.“It didn’t go ahead but a group of about  drivers all met in a bar and raised around pound for Marie Curie.“A gentleman there said I should attend the Lady of the Lakes Festival, also in County Fermanagh.“I drove down to the Festival and met up with Joe Mahon and George Gordon and the NI Truck Show grew from there. “Joe owns Mahon’s Hotel in Irvinestown and George runs a haulage company in Lisburn.“A group of ordinary lorry drivers came together for the Truck Show which has now become an annual event.“Unfortunately, due to the Coronavirus pandemic the Truck Show hasn’t been allowed to operate the past couple of years. “We were on course to top the poundmillion mark for monies raised for charities.“We are hopeful that the Show will be up and running next year and we will reach this milestone.”When asked how James felt about raising so much money for charity, he modestly responded: “I never really thought about it, to be honest!“When I first set out  years ago, I never thought that years later, I would still be doing it, but I’m still going and I hope to take part in the next one.“I do feel that I’ve achieved something, both for myself and the charities who hopefully will benefit from the funds.“It’s a great feeling crossing that finishing line and a great accomplishment to have raised some money along the way.“Sometimes people can view truck drivers in a bad light, but hopefully this will let people see a side to us that they don’t normally see.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1637677532788.jpg--covid_19___tue_23rd_november_figures.jpg?1637677532000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211123newscovid 19 tue 23rd november figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

I want our hospitality to be open right through the Christmas period.His comments come after Robin Swann said on Monday that hospitality venues may have to close over the Christmas period in order to stem a rise in cases – although he stressed this was not “inevitable”.The First Minister, however, said the Executive is acutely aware of the economic impact restrictions has had on businesses, in particular the hospitality industry, pointing out financial safeguards are no longer available.There isn#t the furlough scheme or the hundreds of millions coming from London,” explained Mr Givan.I don#t think we#re in a space where we can be looking at closures.Ms O#Neill also said that rollout of the vaccination means we are in a very dferent place to where we were this time last year.“The predictions and the modelling tells us we could be in a very dficult position by mid Decemberwe don’t reinforce the messages,” she said.“We set out our winter plan that we had toolswe needed them and whenever health advice came forwards and said ‘now’s the time we need them’ we responded.”Mr Swann said the agreed plan would help keep society open and safe, adding: We know what we need to do, we know what has worked in the past.But we also know in comparison to this time last year we also have the benefit of the vaccination and booster programme, he added.Meanwhile, Mr Givan said his party, the DUP had not changed its stance on the contentious issue of Covid passports being introduced here.There are plans for the requirement to come into force across Northern Ireland on December . Before then, however, it will be put to the Assembly for a vote.This means there will be a vote before they come into effect.My position on that and that of my party has not changed, he explained.There are dferences at times in what the best approach is, both in the political institutions and right across the societies.What I#m appealing for is inidually we can all make decisions that will make a cumulative effort. You may not support a mandatory passport, but you can support being vaccinated and getting your booster jab. You can practise good hand hygiene, you can try to limit those contacts in indoor settings.All of us can take inidual actions.Related topicsRobin SwannMichelle O#NeillPaul GivanNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On Robin Swann PremiumConcern as ICU nurses quit jobs amid mounting crisis at the Belfast Health TrustExecutive slammed over decisions as it discusses new Covid curbs PremiumNI Covid restrictions: Apathy and mixed messages to blame for drop off in wearing of masks, says professorCoronavirus NI: Health Minister warns hospitality venues may have to close over ChristmasDUP’s Frew under fire over meeting with woman who abused Swann onlineMost ReadIntervention required, says NI Executive on new Covid measures to ‘step up effort’ on halting virus spreadSilence from Orange Order after members attend Tweed’s funeralCoronavirus NI: Health Minister warns hospitality venues may have to close over Christmas‘Strictly confidential’ Belfast Trust files found in desk bought at charity shop – including report on protecting dataArlene Foster ‘delighted’ to be appointed director at peace-building organisation Co-operation IrelandTop VideosPlayVideo: NI couple swap six-bed home for six metre transit vanPlayVideo: #We have  or  Irish flags at the house#, says Garth Brooks on his love affair with IrelandPlayGarth Brooks #what could be worse than disappointing , people #Latest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Four deaths and , new casesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageUK Government refuses to put timetable on Article  use after minister#s Christmas claimAine TonerOpinionChristmas party season is the most socially awkward time of the yearConcern as ICU nurses quit jobs amid mounting crisis at the Belfast Health TrustLatestSergio Conceicao confident Porto will cope better with Liverpool than last matchPSG boss Mauricio Pochettino unwilling to discuss links to Manchester United jobDesigner Kelly Hoppen says she feels ‘very British’ as she collects CBEFormer MS boss Lord Rose appointed chairman of AsdaCare provided to suicidal special forces soldier was inadequate, family say,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

be appointed “as soon as possible”.Read MoreBullying, favouritism, ageism… the accusations that keep haunting BBC NIIt comes following an inquiry conducted by Lord Dyson which found the BBC fell short of “high standards of integrity and transparency” over the infamous Martin Bashir interview with Princess Diana in .An internal BBC review led by Sir Nicholas Serota resulted in a number of recommendations.Mr Johnson has been tasked by BBC director general Tim Davie to lead the subsequent delivery changes around editorial processes, governance and culture.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The review by Sir Nicholas pointed to “a failure of scrutiny at each stage, around the Bashir scandal and concluded the events were a “betrayal of the values and standards which should underpin every action at the BBC, at all levels”.Changes recommended in the review included strengthened governance, a signicantly improved system for raising editorial concerns and whistleblowing, and less defensiveness and more transparency in how the BBC reacts to the outside world.Following the review, the BBC committed to a -point impartiality plan to further raise standards across the organisation and challenge claims of bias.The impartiality plan includes measures like a new whistleblowing policy, more representation of dferent views and viewpoints on and off screen, better governance and more training on impartiality for staff.Mr Johnston will be tasked with leading the project and told staff it was a complex and substantial piece of work which needs to begin immediately.As a consequence, I will be stepping away from my role as director BBC Northern Ireland until next summer, he said.We#ll be putting arrangements in place to appoint an interim director BBC Northern Ireland as soon as possible and I will support them in whatever way I can and stay in touch with local BBC issues and developments.Mr Johnston has been director of BBC Northern Ireland since  becoming the youngest person to hold the position despite a lack of any direct journalistic experience.A married father-of-two, Mr Johnston was born in  and was educated at Ballymena Academy and Imperial College London, where he completed a Master’s in chemical engineering and management.Most ReadIntervention required, says NI Executive on new Covid measures to ‘step up effort’ on halting virus spreadSilence from Orange Order

The Moneyneena woman, along with her husband Chris and young son Oisin, had just moved into their new home in Portstewart weeks before lockdown hit in March . The  year-old was on maternity leave at the time and toyed with the idea of releasing her own music. After uploading one of her songs onto her social media account, Kate was spurred on to keep writing following a positive reaction to her music. “I have been writing songs since I was  but I just never really got the chance to go down this road properly,” explained Kate, who is better known in Ballinascreen as Catherine Kennedy. “It really all happened during lockdown and maternity leave. The whole world shut down so I kind of found myself needing a creative outlet so I went down this path and started off with one single and it turned into the whole album.” Growing up in rural County Derry, Kate was inspired by the musical talent all around her. “Ive loved music as long as I remember. Draperstown is a great hub for music,” the former St Eoghans Moneyneena and St Patricks Maghera student said. “The likes of Maurice Regan and Glasgowbury brought music into the town. I actually live a mile from Glasgowbury so Ive always looked up to the scene. “Ive worked in Danny Ottersons music shop in Maghera and I worked in the Empire Music Hall as well when I was younger so I always had lots of music around me.” Even though she has been singing at wedding ceremonies and other events in local churches since the age of , with some encouragement from her older brother, Kate decided to explore songwriting. “My brother bought me a guitar for my seventeenth birthday and suggested I maybe try and write some of my own songs, so thats when it all started and it was always a nice distraction from doing A-levels,” she said. Fast forward  years and Kate has just released her second single Wrong Side of the Town from her upcoming debut album Fallen from Grace, due for release in the New Year. The new single, which features the unmistakable vocals of Cormac Neeson, lead singer of The Answer and successful solo artist. Despite the new song only being released five days earlier, Hotpress announced it as its track of the day on Wednesday. On Friday night past, Kate and Cormac performed the song live for the first time at an In the Round night of music with Sound of Belfast in the Empire Music Hall. The gig was one which Kate had been dreaming about for some time. “I used to glass collect thereand I used to look up at that stage and listen to all the amazing music so its a bit of a dream that this is happening,” said Kate. “Im a really big fan of Cormacs. He was one of the acts that stood out to me when I worked in the Empire. He was playing in his band The Answer and I had to rub my eyes to check it wasnt Robert Plant. He has just one of the best voices in the industry, I think. “I worked with Mojo Furys frontman, Michael Mormecha for the album and I told him that I would love Cormac to sing on this song and he just asked him and sent him the song and he said he was up for it. “Its really funny, a year before this all came about, I was at a gig and Cormac was playing at it. I said to my husband Chris how cool would he be on Wrong Side of the Town  I had the song written and had this all in my head and its happened. Its pretty cool how it worked out. “This is one of my favourite songs to date. I love the blues rock sound we have achieved using inspirations from some Deep South Americana  Blues music and some soundtracks I love, such as True Detective and Sons of Anarchy. “Wrong Side of the Town explores the often fine and blurry line that can exist between having a really great time, and that of self destruction. The song aims to look at this from ious angles.” Kate, who recently became a mum for the second time to baby Tomas, now three months-old, admits that her music doesnt fit neatly into any category and she is heavily influenced by a iety of artists. “I love a big range of music but Dolores ORiordan of The Cranberries is one of my icons. I also like Amy Winehouse. Theres also a big American theme running through my music,” she continued. “I call it alternative country rock – the closest thing to it would be Sheryl Crowe - it doesnt fit neatly into any category.” So, with her newest single receiving rave reviews and an album launch just around the corner, Kate says she is looking forward to more live performances and is even thinking about her next project. “Ive been delighted with the reaction to the singles – Wrong Side of the Town and Street Lamps - I got really great support for it and Im just looking forward to getting the whole album out and hopefully there will be a nice celebration for it. “Im also looking forward to being able to perform to a live audience. Ive played live over Zoom through a group called Mothers in Music with the Oh Yeah Music Centre who have been really supportive. “Charlene Hegarty from Maghera is the talent development officer with the Oh Yeah Music Centre and she has been helping us Mothers in Music as a group. Its been lovely to have her support. “Theres just something very special about playing live in front of real people. Its so dferent compared to performing over Zoom – its like night and day. Zoom was brilliant for the times that were in it but live music is where its at. Theres just something about the atmosphere and having people in the room at the same time. “Thinking about the future, I love Irish traditional music as well so Im kind of thinking along those lines for the next project maybe. Its something a bit dferent.” Kate says she enjoys making the trip home to Moneyneena once or twice a month and says she is delighted with the support she has received from locals. “I love Moneyneena. Its a gorgeous part of the world. I am delighted to still be living in County Derry, so Im not too far away. “Ive been really taken aback by how supportive people have been. Ive had really nice support and I couldnt be more grateful for their support and encouragement but I dont take anything for granted. Im just going to enjoy it,” she added.

The families are hoping to raise as much money as they can for Foyle Hospice and HURT, an addiction services charity in the city. After the popularity of last year’s lights, which were put up in a bid to cheer everyone up during lockdown, the neighbours decided to go bigger and better this year. People across Derry are heading down to feast their eyes on the amazing winter wonderland display. Laura Meehan, a resident of Racecourse Drive, said she and all the neighbours love the buzz on the street. “There’s always been a couple of houses on the street that have been heavily decorated. Then more and more neighbours asked for theirs to be done. “So, this year, back in January, we all said we would do a big fundraising event this year. There is a donation box in the centre of the street and all the money is counted and split evenly at the end of the night. “You don’t have to pay to see the street, but you can donate in the wee box. We just ask that cars drive slowly because there are kids running around the street. “From five o’clock onwards, the street does not empty but the atmosphere is brilliant. All the neighbours and kids are running around the street. A woman at the top of the street was even making hot chocolates the other night. So many people came down to see the street last year and this year has been really busy already. I think it’s only going to get bigger each year. “This street is the beststreet to live on, everyone is so friendly and looks after each other. It is so lovely and we are so proud.” Residents are askingany companies could please donate selection boxes for when Santa visits throughout December.

Local actress, Rachael O’Connor, will play the lead alongside popular funny man, William Caulfield, who reprises his role as Dame Nanny Cranny. googletag.cmd.push Karen Hawthorne s as the evil Carabosse. Local actor, Conor O’Kane, will play Prince Charming and Orla Mullan as the Lilac Fairy with Keith Lynch as the loveable sidekick, Pickles. It’s been two years since the city has seen a pantomime performed at Christmas due to Covid restrictions. Rachael O’Connor said she is looking forward to ing to the Derry stage after a long time of restrictions and lockdown. The -year-old said:“Its so nice being back in the rehearsal room again. I did my last show in January . Its been such a long time for us all to get here, but weve got here.” Rachael originally trained for theatre in the Millennium Forum when she was  and at just  years old, she appeared on the Voice UK as the youngest contestant in team Kylie Minogue. Rachael went on to perform with Michael Flatley’s Lord of the Dance on the London Palladium stage. Most recently, Rachael has taken to the stage with legendary band ‘DuranDuran’ as backing vocalist on ious shows such as Isle of Wight Festival and The Jonathan Ross Show. The Derry native played Snow White in  at Millennium Forum and loves to perform to a home crowd. She said: “I loved playing Snow White in Derry last time and its funny because when I was younger, my Granny would have taken me and my cousins every year to the pantomime, it was an annual thing. “I was always jealous of all the children on the stage thinking ‘I wish that was me’ and then here we are. Derry is such a great crowd to perform in front of because everyones so supportive and everyone cheers and getsinvolvedand theyre just so lovely. I do always get nervous, especially on the opening night, just because its your first time doing it in front of a real audience, but at the minute Im more excited than nervous.” The pantomime is set to run  shows throughout the winter season beginning November  and wrapping up on January . Rachael’s co-star, Conor O’Kane, set to play Prince Charming in the production, said it is amazing to be back rehearsing again after such a long time away. The -year-old Derry man said: “This is the biggest show that Ive done sinceCOVID. I think a lot of us are thinking the same, with getting the voices back in gear and getting the body back in gear, but everyone is in the same boat and we are all ready and excited, we’re flying. “Everyone is looking and sounding great. Everyone cannot wait to get back to those local audiences for the first Christmas panto in two years.” Conor is   of The Four Harps and is a co-founder ofGOLEM!a company specialising in repurposing and reimagining original texts. He was also nominated ‘Best Male in a Musical by Off West End for his performance in ‘Miss Nightingale’ at The Vaults in . Conor played alongside Rachael in the  production of Snow White at the Forum and said It is lovely to be back working alongside her and sharing the stage with his niece Olivia. He said: “I’ve worked with Rachael before we’ve known each other for years and years. Our first time working together professionally as adults was when we did Snow White in . “Its nice just to sort of circle back and come back to where we both started because we both did the Youth Theatre at the Millennium forum as well. “There is such a buzz around the building and in rehearsals, it’s like getting back to the family, this isn’t the first time for a lot of us. “I think that its the same in the city. People are definitely really looking forward to doing something that feels traditionally part of Christmas, because they didnt get to do that last year. “It’s a whirlwind but we wouldn’t have it any other way.” Tickets for this year’s pantomime are available at the box office or atmillenniumforumADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street -

Local actress, Rachael O’Connor, will play the lead alongside popular funny man, William Caulfield, who reprises his role as Dame Nanny Cranny. googletag.cmd.push Karen Hawthorne s as the evil Carabosse. Local actor, Conor O’Kane, will play Prince Charming and Orla Mullan as the Lilac Fairy with Keith Lynch as the loveable sidekick, Pickles. It’s been two years since the city has seen a pantomime performed at Christmas due to Covid restrictions. Rachael O’Connor said she is looking forward to ing to the Derry stage after a long time of restrictions and lockdown. The -year-old said:“Its so nice being back in the rehearsal room again. I did my last show in January . Its been such a long time for us all to get here, but weve got here.” Rachael originally trained for theatre in the Millennium Forum when she was  and at just  years old, she appeared on the Voice UK as the youngest contestant in team Kylie Minogue. Rachael went on to perform with Michael Flatley’s Lord of the Dance on the London Palladium stage. Most recently, Rachael has taken to the stage with legendary band ‘DuranDuran’ as backing vocalist on ious shows such as Isle of Wight Festival and The Jonathan Ross Show. The Derry native played Snow White in  at Millennium Forum and loves to perform to a home crowd. She said: “I loved playing Snow White in Derry last time and its funny because when I was younger, my Granny would have taken me and my cousins every year to the pantomime, it was an annual thing. “I was always jealous of all the children on the stage thinking ‘I wish that was me’ and then here we are. Derry is such a great crowd to perform in front of because everyones so supportive and everyone cheers and getsinvolvedand theyre just so lovely. I do always get nervous, especially on the opening night, just because its your first time doing it in front of a real audience, but at the minute Im more excited than nervous.” The pantomime is set to run  shows throughout the winter season beginning November  and wrapping up on January . Rachael’s co-star, Conor O’Kane, set to play Prince Charming in the production, said it is amazing to be back rehearsing again after such a long time away. The -year-old Derry man said: “This is the biggest show that Ive done sinceCOVID. I think a lot of us are thinking the same, with getting the voices back in gear and getting the body back in gear, but everyone is in the same boat and we are all ready and excited, we’re flying. “Everyone is looking and sounding great. Everyone cannot wait to get back to those local audiences for the first Christmas panto in two years.” Conor is   of The Four Harps and is a co-founder ofGOLEM!a company specialising in repurposing and reimagining original texts. He was also nominated ‘Best Male in a Musical by Off West End for his performance in ‘Miss Nightingale’ at The Vaults in . Conor played alongside Rachael in the  production of Snow White at the Forum and said It is lovely to be back working alongside her and sharing the stage with his niece Olivia. He said: “I’ve worked with Rachael before we’ve known each other for years and years. Our first time working together professionally as adults was when we did Snow White in . “Its nice just to sort of circle back and come back to where we both started because we both did the Youth Theatre at the Millennium forum as well. “There is such a buzz around the building and in rehearsals, it’s like getting back to the family, this isn’t the first time for a lot of us. “I think that its the same in the city. People are definitely really looking forward to doing something that feels traditionally part of Christmas, because they didnt get to do that last year. “It’s a whirlwind but we wouldn’t have it any other way.” Tickets for this year’s pantomime are available at the box office or atmillenniumforumADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street -

Creator and writer of Derry Girls, Lisa McGee, saw the social media campaign and said yes to his request. Eamonn was born with cerebral palsy which affects his movement and speech. The -year-oldgraduated from his drama course in summer this year and wants to follow his dreams to be a writer and actor. Speaking to the BBC, Eamonn said: I want to inspire people to chase their dreams to write and act. I think its great to show that some things are possible evenyou have a disability. I had a massive smile on my face. His friend Sean added: For Eamonn to have a degree and have cerebral palsy is a massive deal for him and his family. Hes a massive Derry Girls fan so we decided to push hard to get on it. Eamonn messaged the cast directly and I tried whatever influence I have on Twitter to contact Lisa McGee too. It might be a small thing to be an extra in the cast but this was a massive opportunity for Eamonn. We cant say anything about the scene really, but Eamonn was in a pretty prominent position so hopefully he will be seen.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street -

Reporter: Jenner Grfiths Nov   addthis, I thought no it’s too early, nope Jen don’t write about Christmas yet, it is ONLY November! googletag.cmd.push BUT,I know some of you parents will soon be sayingI’ve done all my Christmas shopping, the adverts are on the TV, the songs are starting to be hummed, the children are starting to practice their Christmas songs and plays and the decorations are in the shops . So, I thought, Jen, sometimes you’ve just go to go with the flow… I had an article all ready for you about ideas for presents and then I thought STOP…what about those who dread Christmas, the cost of it, the feeling of how will I cope with the financial part, the wondering who WILL I borrow the money from to pay for everything  For some Christmas really is like this, me and you, can sit in our warm homes, circling the catalogues, putting things in our internet basket, searching and driving for miles for that present that cost hundreds of pounds whose novelty will have worn off by the new year. But for some families it’s dferent, wondering how do I pay for the oil, the bills, the school pants he needs as he’s grown so much and buy that second hand bike he’s got his heart set on. Me or you might say, just budget, save all year, a little every week and it’ll soon add up but for some it just isn’t that easy. I often think, and maybe we all should, ‘there for the grace of God go I’. So, sorry guys, my first Christmas article is about those less fortunate than us. Rather than circling those presents tonight, rather trying to decide between Marks  Spencers luxury goose or Sainsbury’s Finest three bird roast, think what can you do, actually do, to make a dference, to make Christmas special for others. Charity begins at home As a mum who has been skint, yep that was me, I tried to get things from the charity shop, so could you have a clear out, donate your old toys, or maybe even clothes, give them a wash and hand them in. Oh, but do make sure al the pieces are there, no boy wants a train track that doesn’t join together! Join a toy appeal or create one yourself with family and friends - schools and community centres often do these - just make the call, what do they need  Make a box, a person box for a lady, man or family box for those who may be homeless, may be at a refuge. Items like shampoo, toothbrush might be normal for me and you butyou are living on the streets or had to leave your home quickly these things matter, don’t forget to put a treat in there too though! Foodand the foodbank, millions of people use our essential food banks, simply pop a few extra bits in your trolley and donate, donate donate! Furniture,some of you might be getting a new couch   curtains etc for Christmas, but what are you dong with your old one, do you really have to sell it, do you really need the money, could you donate instead  Lots of charitiesmight know of a family who would love yours. Don’t forget too, our animals in shelters, the dogs found wandering the streets in the cold and wet who no one bothered to look for, the cats too old to be rehoused, the rabbits who simply got forgotten when their owners moved. Animal shelters need your support too, many would love to receive your old blankets, again give them a call and ask do you need anything  Christmas tree, everyone expects to have a Christmas tree, it’s traditional, a home is not home at Christmas without one, but a tree can cost from pound. to pound.could you donatea tree, promise a family a tree, donate your old tree   Presentsyes you can buy to give, presents that can help others too, yes they aren’t for your neighbours over the road or round the corner but they are still your neighbours in the world, check out Oxfam and help a child go to school, or CMBUK and help train a doctor or nurse, or Unicef and help a ‘Mum to be’. But remember,help yourself, don’t be tempted to splurge and spend, spend, spend, that credit card will want paying! Do you really want to be still paying for Christmas in August when you could have had turkey instead of goose, crackers from Asda and been strong enough to stick to your money limit and yes this does mean that the kids get one main present not a bike, phone, tv and computer!! Remember Christmas is about being together, about making memories, smiles, it’s about happy days, love and laughter, it really is that simple, for you, me, the dog in the shelter, for all of us everywhere.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field.

Currently, the minimum wage rates are staggered with ious age groups earning separate levels of pay. Those aged  to  are entitled to pound. an hour,  to -year-olds get pound., those aged  and  receive pound. while workers of the age of  and upwards get paid an hourly rate of pound.. Cllr Harkin insists that minimum wage parity for all ages must be imposed and will call upon the Council to send a message to Derrys young people that they have their backs in their right for equal pay. He said: “If we want young people to have hope, to stay here and to thrive here, we need to shake-up the status quo propped up by corporations and the Stormont Executive. “The political establishment has been quick to ly demonise young people for spreading the covid virus – and some have tried to use young people as fodder for sectarian violence – but not a finger has been lted by Executive parties to challenge rip-off wages paid to young people. “Its unacceptable for - yr-olds to be paid only pound. an hour. Under-s are paid less pound an hour. What kind of message does it send to young people that they dont deserve even the basic minimum wage of pound.  “The cynical politics of ision constantly pursued by both sides of the unionist and nationalist establishment does nothing to help young people. “When it comes to standing up for young people its been blah blah blah from the Executive. “Theres been no anti-poverty strategy. Continued failure to properly expand Magee and create the type of infrastructure Derry and the North West needs. “Theyve done zero to promote voting rights for  and -year-olds. Student demands have been ignored. And, egregiously, the Executive has done nothing to challenge rip-off wages paid to young people working in key sectors. “We believe our Council should promote equal pay for equal work and be advocates for our young people, including education about trade union rights. Young workers should receive equal pay for equal work and their contribution throughout the pandemic should be properly acknowledged.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street -

The investment will see the business triple its annual turnover from the licensing of its content in the next financial year. The funds have been secured with Ulster Bank through the UK Government-backed Recovery Loan Scheme. Launched in April this year, the scheme supports access to finance for businesses of any size as they grow and recover from the disruption caused by the COVID- pandemic. Established in  by co-founders Catherine Davies and Mark Nagurski, Makematic partners with high-profile brands – including Amazon, Adobe, Microsoft and Crayola – and non-profit organisations – such as the New-York Historical Society – to produce and distribute short, educational animations and live action videos. Ulster Bank business development manager Aidan McGrath said: “In , Catherine and Mark saw how the education sector was developing and identied the need for a service to respond to growing demand for creative and engaging digital learning resources. “The signs were there for its future adoption, but few could have predicted such a signicant and sudden sht to digital and remote learning. “That sht has amplied demand and presented massive opportunities for growth. We’re extremely pleased to play our role in supporting Makematic to scale-up.” Mr Nagurski says the bank’s support is fuelling the company’s expansion over the coming months. He said: “It has been a very interesting, albeit challenging time in the education space. “There was an overnight sht to digital and remote learning a development that was already in play, but accelerated by the pandemic. “For us, this translates to a strong uptick in new business bookings and clients. “With the support of Ulster Bank we’re now developing a new licensing  that will enable us to take the business to the next level.” Ms Davies adds: “The technology will overhaul our licensing and distribution process, and this is the cornerstone of our next fundraising round as we speak to private investors in the UK, US and Australia. “Previously, we managed our licensing and distribution manually. Our new  will be an automated one, generating a consistent revenue stream while we focus on building the business and brand in new markets and sectors.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street -

The investment will see the business triple its annual turnover from the licensing of its content in the next financial year. The funds have been secured with Ulster Bank through the UK Government-backed Recovery Loan Scheme. Launched in April this year, the scheme supports access to finance for businesses of any size as they grow and recover from the disruption caused by the COVID- pandemic. Established in  by co-founders Catherine Davies and Mark Nagurski, Makematic partners with high-profile brands – including Amazon, Adobe, Microsoft and Crayola – and non-profit organisations – such as the New-York Historical Society – to produce and distribute short, educational animations and live action videos. Ulster Bank business development manager Aidan McGrath said: “In , Catherine and Mark saw how the education sector was developing and identied the need for a service to respond to growing demand for creative and engaging digital learning resources. “The signs were there for its future adoption, but few could have predicted such a signicant and sudden sht to digital and remote learning. “That sht has amplied demand and presented massive opportunities for growth. We’re extremely pleased to play our role in supporting Makematic to scale-up.” Mr Nagurski says the bank’s support is fuelling the company’s expansion over the coming months. He said: “It has been a very interesting, albeit challenging time in the education space. “There was an overnight sht to digital and remote learning a development that was already in play, but accelerated by the pandemic. “For us, this translates to a strong uptick in new business bookings and clients. “With the support of Ulster Bank we’re now developing a new licensing  that will enable us to take the business to the next level.” Ms Davies adds: “The technology will overhaul our licensing and distribution process, and this is the cornerstone of our next fundraising round as we speak to private investors in the UK, US and Australia. “Previously, we managed our licensing and distribution manually. Our new  will be an automated one, generating a consistent revenue stream while we focus on building the business and brand in new markets and sectors.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street -

Many people, regardless of age, are taking on more caring responsibilities for their relatives and friends who may be disabled, ill or older and need support, and the project launches on Thursday, November , to mark International Carers Rights Day. Mayor Warke said he hoped to see lots of local schools bridging the generation gap and engaging with the scheme. He said: “By keeping people at the heart of what we do, we hope to encourage as many schools and pupils to reach out and engage with their family, friends and neighbours aged  plus years in a way suited to them, whilst linking the activities to the National Curriculum. “Intergenerational practice helps bring people together in a purposeful way, which promotes greater understanding and respect between generations, and contributes to creating more cohesive communities through mutually beneficial activities. “This can help build confidence, challenge assumptions and prejudice, and help tackle social isolation and loneliness in both groups. “Using this approach, the Council hopes to build upon the ongoing engagement being rolled out across the District to gauge the views of people aged  plus years.” The initiative is geared towards pupils in Key Stage Two of Primary School and also Key Stage Three of Post Primary schools, and participating pupils are encouraged to complete the activities either face to face, by telephone or digitally, to ensure the safest and most appropriate approach is used. Schools who get involved and participate in the initiative will be entered into a competition which offers a number of prizes include pound, a five-week onsite multi-sport coaching programme as well as a number of family swim passes. Schools will be receiving information on this initiative electronically and for further information please contact the Age Friendly Co-ordinator on    or by email: agefriendly@derrystrabane ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street -

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa, Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa, Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

A long-standing campaigner for greater road safety in Derry, Cllr Duffy has in the past helped bring about a pedestrian crossing on the Skeoge Road and also repairs to the safety railings there as well. She has also been vocal on the demand to upgrade the Buncrana Road to help ease congestion for vehicles heading to and from Co. Donegal. Cllr Duffy hopes her motion ahead of Thursdays main council meeting will help put pressure on the Executive to get Derrys roads sorted out. She said: “Despite a record allocation from Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy to the Department of Infrastructure which allowed for a structural maintenance budget of pound million, we are clearly not seeing the benefit of that investment here in Derry. “The historic lack of investment has now been exacerbated by the fact that resurfacing contracts in this council area have been delayed due to a legal challenge. “The result of all that is more misery for motorists dealing with a road network that is in an unacceptable condition and badly in need of investment. “My motion calls on the minister to deliver that investment as a matter of urgency and I hope all parties can support it.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol. Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Fitzroys on Bridge Street -

James McClures th minute goal saw the Loup take a healthy six-point lead into the half time break, after the hosts had cut loose during the second quarter. However, St Patricks would not score for another  minutes, and their opponents used the time wisely, chipping away at the lead, with just the goal separating the sides at the second half water break. The Magherafelt side defeated in tonights Jack Cassidy Cup semi final. Loups composure had deserted them and by the time an Eoghan Hawe free reduced the gap to one on  minutes, the side in red looked the more likely winners. Time was on Rossas side, but just as the tide appeared to be turning, Loup rode the wave and hit back, John McClure tapping over a free with five minutes to go to settle the nerves. Aidan McAlynn then slotted another free, and despite a late Magherafelt onslaught that yielded a Dan Higgins point, the hosts held firm to reach a decider against Dungiven. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

We need to consider the needs of all our pupils and their respective futures.Cllr Walker added: ldquoI have met with those for and opposed to the new integrated college proposal and am pleased to have done so as it is the right thing to do.

The races also had dfering start times with the longer distances starting earlier in the day.Doing laps often keeps the runners compact in terms of marshalling and spectating but it can mean that those doing the longer distances are tested mentally when they see others finishing.It is sometimes hard to carry on for the next loop when you can see others reaching the end of their efforts. It also means where there is a hill or a tricky part of the race, you will see it more than onceyou are doing the marathon or the ultra. The k route was slightly separate but also included a few steep sections so it was not an easy option by any means.Marguerite Robinson had been training hard to regain fitness after a layoff with injury and had hoped to be ready to use her half marathon slot, which was a deferred entry from last yearrsquos event, that was called off due to Covid- restrictions.However, as race day approached, she realised that on this occasion that she might be taking on more than she could chew and certainly more than she would enjoy so she wisely switched to the K.She was easy with her decision once the race got underway and even more so during the last mile when she was running the drag uphill from the gate to the finish. She completed in . and was th female .Declan Teague has been in fine marathon form recently, packing in three such races in short succession from September into October, but this one was notable as it got him to number  in his tally.Unfortunately since his last race, he has had to reduce his training miles due to niggles and he arrived at the start line knowing that he was going to have to dig deep to get round.He was therefore delighted to hook up with Phillip Vint as the race got underway and said that the camaraderie took their mind off the big climbs and got them through the first hour with ease.Phillip was on his way to his th marathon and in his usual understated fashion he was just there to get on with it.The commitment and consistency of these guys has to be admired.As much as Declan was enjoying the company, he urged Phillip to press on to pursue his own pace. Phillip very gradually eased away over the miles ahead and finished a superb th overall in three hours and  minutes.This would be a commendable time on tarmac let alone on an off road event. Declan stuck to his own rhythm and was happy with his time of . which placed him nd out of the  who completed.Clare Carson was also in for the marathon distance and taking it in her stride she dipped in just under the five hours to add another one to the long list that she is accumulating.They all commented that they found the downhills as tough as the ups and the quad muscles had definitely taken a battering, but despite the testing route, it is one they will likely repeat.Stephen Heasley, who was in Tollymore to take part in the ultra distance, reported back that he was a lsquoDNFrsquo. For those of you who are unsure what DNF means, it is short for lsquodid not finishrsquo.Most would assume that this would be a major disappointment.In Stephenrsquos case though, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he had a change of plan rather than a failure.Although he was finding it tough going, he waited until the end of lap two to call it a day so in fact he completed a marathon while considering his options.For many of us managing to finish a marathon on a good day would be a challenge. To do so on a ldquobad day seems almost a triumph.It was certainly the right decision for Stephen on the day and hopefully he will now take time for recovery before his next escapade.Jonny Holmes had taken part in the NIMAA XC Championships a month ago as a way of trying his hand at cross country running.That event also stood as selection for the NI team for the North South Challenge.

Bobby Dalzell Cup with a comprehensive victory over local rivals Killough at a windswept Ballyhornan on Friday night.Two goals in each half, including a brace from Celtic striker Jay Gibney, was enough to ensure it would be the Hoops who would be contending for this yearrsquos title on December .To both teams credit, the number of supporters that flooded through the gates to watch this spectacle was more than commendable, with hundreds of people in attendance to witness what is historically a feisty encounter between the sides mdash this occasion being no dferent.Killough, donning their new kit, kicked off, but in a matter of moments found themselves defending a free-kick in a dangerous area, although Celtic centre back Gary Carberry saw his effort well saved by lsquokeeper Christopher Mallon.The opening minutes played out to a rapid pace of football, with the wind unsure of which direction to blow resulting in both teams attempting to play on the ground.Killoughrsquos first big opportunity came courtesy of a Connor Kelly free-kick after team-mate Cillian Burns was pulled down by defender Blaine Connolly unfairly.However, Kellyrsquos effort just whisked over the crossbar in what would prove to be a seldom chance for the village side in the opening  minutes.What Celtic seemed to have in their arsenal which Killough lacked was showing clinical precision and accuracy from their set pieces.With seven minutes on the clock, the Hoops would have their first of  corners throughout the match, with the Killough defence failing to clear the danger with any conviction, allowing the ball to float back across the box and into the path of Celtic marksman Jay Gibney.The striker made no mistake with the finish and the deadlock was broken.Referee James McCreesh certainly had his work cut out, as he consistently gave verbal warnings to both teams and their management as he did a commendable job controlling the pace of the contest.However, his patience was tested one too many times and after a quarter of an hour, Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves received the first yellow card of the game for a tackle on Gerard Collins.Celticrsquos Peter Casey struck the resultant free and was unlucky to see his effort kiss the top of the crossbar.The Hoops continued their pressure and were rewarded with a corner. Barry Treacy, whose set piece efforts were fantastic throughout the  minutes, stepped up to strike a low cross into the box for captain Mikey Rice to tap in and double his sidersquos lead.Rice was instrumental for Celtic and deservedly was awarded man of the match for his efforts.A manic couple of minutes ensued after another corner caused Killough problems, the ball this time falling to Casey who saw his left-footed effort crash off the underside of the crossbar and somehow away to safety.Celtic kept their relentless efforts in attack and a moment later they thought they had their third, but their strike was ruled out for offside. Killough then failed to properly dispatch the ball up the pitch, allowing Hoopsrsquo striker Jordan McCoubrey to attack their goal.However, McCoubrey was left frustrated when his appeal for a penalty was waved off by McCreesh.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns received a booking for a hearty tackle on the opposition before team-mate and lsquokeeper Mallon managed to ert the ball away from the net in a dramatic goal line scramble.In what was an admittedly underwhelming performance by Killough, custodian Mallon made a number of inspiring saves throughout the match and kept the final score at a much more respectable tally.Celticrsquos Casey must have thought he had been the subject of a curse, after his third long ranged effort in the space of  minutes struck the woodwork, this time a spectacular  yard effort thumping against the upper left.Killough managed to weather the storm and their best chance of the half came from captain Gareth Georgersquos free-kick which sailed wide of the post before Celticrsquos Connolly picked up a yellow card for a combination of fouls.That signalled the last signicant action of the opening  as Celtic led by two at the half-time interval.Upon the restart, Shaun Megahey managed to sneak past the Killough backline to force a point blank range save from Mallon as changes were made to both sides, including the introduction of Stephen Galbraith for the Hoops.Carberry was the latest entry into the book after dragging down Killoughrsquos Kelly before the village side suffered an injury blow in the form of midfielder Matt McKiernan on the hour mark.The game had settled down at this point, with Killough still deciding whether to stick or twist as they knew they needed a goal, but one wrong move and the game would be put beyond their reach.Mallon continued to impress in goals, with an eye-catching one handed save off a Carberry header, although at the th minute the result was put beyond doubt.A calamity of errors in the Killough defence allowed Gibney to square the ball to substitute Galbraith, who tapped into the open net to completely crush their opponentsrsquo fighting spirit.Killough are known for their resilience and kept fighting to the conclusion, but it was clear that it wouldnrsquot be their day as the clock wound down.Megahey picked up a yellow for the Hoops before his opponents saw a penalty appeal for a hand ball shut down.Tempers continued to flair as Killoughrsquos Ruairi Sharvin added his name to the list of yellow card recipients just before his sidersquos misery compounded when Gibney added Celticrsquos fourth of the match with a neatly struck finish.Killough resorted to shooting from distance but werenrsquot having much luck, with Jack McLoughlinrsquos effort the only to really cause Celtic custodian Nathan Curran to spring into action with a confident one handed save.Groves did manage to loop a headed effort past Curran. However, as per the theme of the match, Celticrsquos defence managed to clear the ball before it could cross the line.McCreesh blew his whistle for the final time to send the Celtic fans into raptures as the players audibly voiced their pleasure at making yet another final.Man of the match and Hoopsrsquo skipper Mikey Rice gave his thoughts on the performance after the contest.ldquoEveryone knows what theyrsquore getting with Celtic Bhoys and Killough, big hits, hard tackles and a great spectacle for the neutral, he said.ldquoYou see the amount of people who came down here, especially for the Newcastle league teams, itrsquos brilliant. It was always going to be a great game and I respect Killough a lot, he continued.ldquoI think there was a few people here watching the match who will be featuring in next weekrsquos semi-final between Dundrum and Ardglass, so hopefully we gave them a wee bit of fear to face us.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran S Megahey, B Connolly, G Carberry M Rice , G Collins, B Treacy, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, N Williams-McCabe.Subs: C Kerr, S Galbraith, S McMahon, C McCartan.Killough: C Mallon, S Og Burns, G George , E Gargan, R Sharvin, M McKiernan, D Burns, K Groves, C Burns, C Kelly, J McLoughlin.Subs: D Looney, T McIlhone, L Murphy, R Burns, D Taggart.Yellow cards: K Groves, D Burns, R Sharvin.Corners: Celtic Bhoys , Killough .Offsides: Celtic Bhoys , Killough ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_castlewellan.jpg","title":"Lease signing paves way for ambitious investment at Castlewellan Forest Park  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have formally approved an agreement which paves the way for a major multi-million pound investment in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Forest Service have signed a draft lease which legally formalises the local authorityrsquos phased takeover of the stunning forest park which attracts tens of thousands of visitors yearly.A pound.m revitalisation project at the park is being backed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the local council, with the latter spearheading the ambitious project to signicantly enhance facilities at the sprawling park, with the lottery funding earmarked to restore a number of key features to help maximise its tourism potential.Construction work has already commenced at the Bothy Yard thanks to funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the EU.Work on the main restoration project is scheduled to complete by December , with the local authority agreeing a lease for the core areas within the park from the Forest Service until .Proposed work includes new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park, a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park. There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue.Caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.The parkrsquos th century greenhouse is also being restored with the reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames, while one of several outbuildings will be converted to an office and volunteer space.Elsewhere, visitor facilities will be created in the Stove Conservatory including an interpretation centre, with a  lt installed to provide access to the terrance for people with reduced mobility.Agreement on the draft lease came at a recent meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee with the news welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillors High Gallagher and Laura Devlin.Mr McGrath said plans to signicantly invest in the park will be a ldquogame changer for the South Down area.He said the cocktail of funding which has been secured to finance the revitalisation project will transform the built and natural heritage of the sprawling forest park andact as a huge pull for visitors to the area.Cllr Gallagher said he was delighted that the lease issue had been resolved and that the project was progressing.ldquoAs a Castlewellan councillor, this project is huge and will bring so much benefit to the wider area, he continued.ldquoThis same lease confirmed that the very popular lsquotouring in the treesrsquo permit for touring caravan owners will remain in Forest Service control until the end of . This was an issue that was raised with me and many local businesses in Castlewellan.Cllr Gallagher said that after , the local authority will assume responsibility for lsquotouring in the treesrsquo and that the local authorityrsquos senior management team recognises the importance of this longstanding tradition continuing.Cllr Devlin said that as a Castlewellan resident and a member of the forest park revitalisation project board, agreeing the draft lease represented a huge step, one she described as ldquohugely signicant.She added: ldquoThis project has been underway for many years and so much work, time and effort has been exerted by council officers, all of the ious agencies, elected members and project board chairperson Sally Montgomery.ldquoTo see all of this work now materialise is superb. I more or less grew up in the forest park as a child and it was so disheartening to see its deterioration over the years so this is one particular project that I am very excited about.Cllr Devlin extended a ldquohuge thanks to everyone who played a signicant part in getting the project to this stage and looks forward to seeing further developments on the ground..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Lions go contactless  ","story":"NEWCASTLE Lions Club have invested in a mobile contactless card payment device for use with their Christmas collections.The card reader was purchased with donations from Lions members and will ensure that % of all donations will go to charity.Club president Liz Murphy hopes themachine will be a success and stresses that the mobile card payment will be set for a pound donation.The card reader card can be used as a contactless or pin number device.

Mallon eventually pointed in the th minute only for Alana McCrickard to take a pass from Dearbhla Magee and fire over a minute later.Mallon responded with a huge score from play and then a th minute point to level the tie at - eachHowever, Dearbhla Magee gave her side the lead once more with a free after a clever move between Aimee McAleenan and Karen McMullan.But Mallon eventually levelled the tie again with a huge free from  metres in the nd minute and then five minutes from time stepped over a free in the left corner where the m line meets the side-line.It was the toughest angle she had faced, but she scored the point and Portaferry held on for a famous first title.Mallon was the player of the match. Portaferry would not have won without her contribution, having scored all eight points, but they also would not have won without the defensive wall they put in front of Fiona McGarry.Mary Jo Mageean, Dearbhla Coleman and Saoirse Sands smothered everything that the Fontenoys threw at them. But on a day like this, everyone put their shoulder to the wheel and it was enough to break the dam.ldquoIt is very hard to win the first. We have tried very hard over the past few years to win this title and it feels so good to actually get there, said Portaferry team mentor Martin Mallon, who was feeling the relief after the final whistle.ldquoI wonrsquot tell you a lie. We were very anxious coming into this final, all of us. You could see it in our play.Girls were tense and nervous out there and Liatroim took advantage.ldquoThey were always going to give us a real battle and you canrsquot give the likes of Dearbhla Magee an inch. I just donrsquot understand how she didnrsquot get an All-star nomination. She is one of the best players in Ireland, he continued.ldquoI felt thatwe got in front, we wouldnrsquot concede.

Would love it. Do I think it will happen  I think it would be impossible.”Askedhe understood how his Irish fans reacted to the news that the gigs were cancelled, he said: “It was conveyed to me. I probably understood as much as I could. But at the same time, you probably couldn’t understand it was like a death in the family to us.“It hurt, hurt, hurt.“My thing is I try not to get emotional as it is still very fresh for me, it was something I never experienced.“It was one of things that was hard to understand.“I’m not sure what it was over here,it was half as bad as it was over at home, then it must have been pretty bad. I don’t know how personal it was, you guys always treated me like I was from here.“If it was personal for you then you know all we all felt. We all went through it together.“I’ve been around the world, there is no place like this.“In Ireland it’s the people that makes it the place you want to be.”He said the opportunity to play to his Irish fans has made him “very happy”.“The chance to come back and to play for those people, that’s a wonderful thing, that all is forgiven,” he added.“I don’t hold a grudge against anybody. I felt lucky for the opportunity, the opportunity was swept away.

Photo: Pacemaker BelfastThe World Cup qualier between Northern Ireland and the Republic has gone down in history as one of the worst displays of sectarian bigotry ever witnessed at a sporting event, however, I have delved into the archives to establish why the subsequent reports are at odds with my own very dferent experience of the match and its aftermath.I uncovered a shocking contrast between what has become the accepted narrative, perpetuated by countless political commentators and pundits, with what was actually reported at the time by those who were there. Contrary to the folklore that sprang from the first misinformed reports of a few columnists, the Northern Ireland fans were widely praised for their behaviour when the potentially problematic fixture passed without incident.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Sports Minister Michael Ancram said the fans’ sporting behaviour had been an example to the rest of the footballing world’”.In the Belfast , Irish President Mary Robinson is quoted as saying the game had “been a triumph for sport on this island”.The only major talking point was a well-documented pre-match spat between managers Billy Bingham and Jack Charlton that continued during the game and immediately afterwards.In a subsequent interview, Republic manager Charlton would complain that Northern Ireland “tried too hard” having clearly expected Bingham’s team to roll over in what was the legendary Northern Ireland manager’s last game in charge of the national side.By the weekend, sectarian, and even Nazi-like racial supremacy, motivators had been attached to Northern Ireland’s will to win, with one Dublin newspaper saying the Northern Ireland team had been “swept forward in a loyalist rage.”In the Dail, Fine Gael TD Austin Deasy said Billy Bingham should be indicted for “inciting national hatred”.Playwright Marie Jones, shocked by what she read in the Sunday papers, began developing the idea for ‘A Night in November’ - the fictional tale of a NI fan so sickened by the sectarian bigotry that he switches allegiance to the Republic.An academic study carried out in reported: “Following the Belfast match, the reaction in some quarters seemed to border on the hysterical.”• See Wednesday’s News Letter for the full in-depth report——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

This was . per cent of those lsquoredrsquo calls being attended to in the response time - making Cardf and Vale the only health board in Wales to meet the  per cent target.The health board also received, amber - less urgent but still serious - calls and , green calls - cases where a non-emergency response is more appropriate..This October saw the highest number of calls for an ambulance than any other October since the May  period when the data was first made available. It was also the firth month in a row where the daily lsquoredrsquo call average was above  ndash with an average of  lsquoredrsquo calls last month.The Wales-wide statistics report that just  per cent of lsquoredrsquo calls received a response time within eight minutes ndash the lowest since the data was first made available in May . It is down . per cent on September.Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ldquoThe pressures the NHS are currently facing, particularly in urgent and emergency care, are worrying for all. Recent figures show the impact that the enormous pressures on the NHS are having on ambulance waits outside of Emergency Departments and how this effects the experience of patients..removeldquoItrsquos important to understand that this is a whole-system issue. There are many factors affecting NHS capacity from staff absences because of Covid or suspected Covid, to more people on wards and in intensive care units needing treatment for Covid and higher demand for other conditions. The social care system is also under unprecedented pressure, meaning the NHS is unable to discharge patients from hospital and therefore has much lower capacity to treat incoming patients.ldquoThe NHS in Wales is working relentlessly to cope with current levels of demand and staff are doing all they can to ensure everyone waiting for care is seen as soon as possible. We thank them and the public for doing all they can to support the NHS.A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: ldquoThe latest data shows the pressure on our health and care system continues to grow. But our hardworking health and social care staff continue to deliver high quality care when people need it.On the ambulance waits, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe ambulance service in Wales, like the rest of the UK, continues to be under great strain. The number of red calls, which are classed as le-threatening, in October were the highest ever on record. The number of calls in October were also  per cent higher than October last year.ldquoEarlier this year we provided an additional pound million to go towards supporting the transformation of urgent and emergency care services to deliver the right care in the right place, first time.ldquoThe ambulance service has also received funding for the recruitment of the equivalent of  staff.ldquoWe encourage people to consider the best options for care, and not necessarily head to their local emergency department. To get the right care first time, people can also use the online  service and their local pharmacist where appropriate.Emergency Department dataThe figures show , people attended the emergency department at University Hospital of Wales Cardf in October. Of these , - or . per cent - were seen within the four hour target. This puts the health board in the middle of the Welsh statistics.The latest data shows that there were,attendances to all NHS Wales emergency departments in October . This was: . per centlower than the previous month , . per centhigher than in the same month last yearbut . per centlowerthan October .MORE NEWS:The average number of emergency department attendances per day in October  was ,. This was:  fewer attendances per day on average than in the previous month,  more than in the same month in  but  fewer than in October .According to Welsh Government targets,  per cent of patients should spend less than four hours at an emergency department.The latest monthrsquos data shows that . per centof patients in all NHS emergency departments spent less than fourhours in the department from arrival until admission, transfer or discharge. This was: . per cent lower than the previous month, . per cent lower than the same month in , and . per cent lower than the same month in . The  per centtarget continues to be missed.Cancer treatment timesThe Cardf and Vale University Health Board is the third lowest health board in Wales for patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment within the first  days after diagnosis.In total  patients in the health board started their first treatment in the month of September, with  within the first  days of being suspected of having cancer. The total percentage is . per cent of patients starting their first treatment within  days. However this, and all of the health boards in Wales, falls below the target of  per cent.Prior to the Covid- pandemic, on average there were just under , patients starting their first definitive treatment per month. This number fell at the start of the pandemic to a low point of  in May  but has generally been on an upward trend since and in recent months has been in-line with or exceeded activity levels for the corresponding months in .In September , , patients newly diagnosed with cancer started their first definitive treatment in the month.This is an increase of . per centfrom August  and an increase of . per centfrom September .The Welsh Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is encouraging the number of patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment and the number of patients informed they did not have cancer have both increased on the previous month.ldquoIn a boost to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the health minister today announced more than pound million is to be invested in replacing ageing diagnostic imaging equipment across NHS Wales.ldquoThis will signicantly improve image quality, often resulting in earlier and more accurate diagnosis.ldquoWe have invested an extra pound million this year to transform the delivery of services and tackle waiting times, but because of the ongoing pressures and effects of the pandemic we donrsquot expect to see real progress before the spring. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A new low for ABC Council. People rightly expect and deserve better.”He also said he would not be naming the person who allegedly made the comment “until we’re confident we can distinguish the inidual from the recording”.Councillor Peter Lavery said he will always stand shoulder to shoulder with anyone who has been bullied.“It was sad to hear Eoin,” said Cllr Lavery. “I will always stand shoulder to shoulder with anyone who gets abused no matter their background. They can always count on me to back them to take on the bullies.”Read this:- Late train service welcomedEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
