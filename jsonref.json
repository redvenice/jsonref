I don’t think I could reasonably go against that mandate.‘What the DUP will do, you will have to ask them.‘And I would have thought actually the Prime Minster is at a greater risk in a vote of no confidence from people who see themselves as pro EU in the party, than from people who are Eurosceptic.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Number students getting class degrees sky rockets","story":"    Some institutions have seen firsts soar by more than 200 per cent, according to the study by the higher education regulatorEntire state\u0027s high school leavers forced to have their...Crackdown could kill off so-called Mickey Mouse degrees:...First university chief to break the £500,000 barrier (no...Share this articleThey could face huge fines or even get booted out of the sector in a bid to control the problem.Mr Hinds said he had told the OfS to ‘deal firmly’ with the worst offenders and insisted that ‘the scale of this increase in firsts and 2.1s cannot be proportionate to improving standards’.He stressed: ‘I sincerely hope today’s figures act as a wake-up call to the sector – especially those universities which are now exposed as having significant unexplained increases.‘Institutions should be accountable for maintaining the value of the degrees they award.’          Last night Education Secretary Damian Hinds ordered a clampdown on universities to tackle the issueThe OfS analysed degree classifications at 148 universities and other higher education providers across England between 2010-11 and 2016-17. The watchdog used statistical modelling to predict ‘expected’ patterns in degree attainment, taking into account factors such as students’ prior qualifications, subject studied, ethnicity and gender.It discovered evidence of ‘unexplained’ grade inflation at a staggering 84 per cent of institutions.This was either relative to the rest of the sector or to the universities’ prior levels.But 52 per cent (77) of providers had a ‘statistically significant unexplained increase’ in first-class degrees, relative to both the sector and their own previous levels of awards. This includes the University of Surrey, where 50.1 per cent of degrees were classified as firsts in 2016-17, compared to 22.9 per cent in 2010-11.The OfS found that over half of the proportion of firsts (27.3 percentage points) awarded in 2016-17 is ‘unexplained’ in relation to factors such as students’ qualifications on entry. At the University of East Anglia, 38.9 per cent of degrees were firsts in 2016-17 compared to 13.4 per cent in 2010-11.Of this 2016-17 proportion, half – 19.3 percentage points – was ‘unexplained’. And at the University of Huddersfield, the proportion of firsts has more than doubled from 15 per cent in 2010-11 to 37.9 per cent in 2016-17.Of this 2016-17 proportion, around two-thirds – 25.9 percentage points – could not be explained by students’ prior attainment and other factors. Between 2010-11 and 2016-17, the largest percentage increases in firsts were at University College Birmingham (up 225.7 per cent) and Leeds Trinity University (up 220.8 per cent).          The 2.2 degree award is now almost extinct at certain universities, said the Office for Students (stock image)The analysis also shows that in 2010-11 just 6.4 per cent of students who gained below CCD at A-level went on to achieve firsts at university, compared to 18.3 per cent in 2016-17. And at nine universities, including Surrey, the combined proportion of firsts and 2.1s awarded exceeds 90 per cent. Among 20 English Russell Group universities, at least 82 per cent of degrees awarded are now firsts or 2.1s. Overall, the percentage of first and upper second-class degrees awarded has increased from 67 per cent in 2010-11 to 78 per cent in 2016-17. The percentage of first-class degrees has increased from 16 per cent to 27 per cent over the same period.The OfS has a range of possible sanctions against institutions including fines, suspension and the stripping of degree-awarding powers. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, yesterday said it was ‘fundamentally important’ that degrees ‘hold their value over time’. She warned that the sector ‘must quickly get to grips with this issue’. She added: ‘If they do not take action, we will use our powers to drive change.’Alistair Jarvis, of Universities UK, insisted that institutions are ‘already taking steps to tackle grade inflation’. Professor Jane Powell, of the University of Surrey, said its academic standards are endorsed by external examiners.She added that a review was under way to ensure ‘all assessments are sufficiently stretching’."},{"url":null,"title":"Customers exploited phone insurance mortgage companies","story":"    Donna Robinson challenged her billMother-of-four Donna Robinson was paying Virgin Media £54 per month but got that down to  £17.64 when she asked for a better deal.That means she will now save £444 over the next year of her broadband and TV bills. Customers of broabband, TV and phone companies have been hit by a succession of small price rises in recent years. She had used Ismybillfair to challenge her costs and said they had risen as it felt like the firm \u0027added £3, then added £3, then added £3.\u0027She said: \u0027It isn\u0027t right.

For the reign of King Jose has seen Old Trafford, the stadium dubbed the Theatre of Dreams in homage to the feats of Bobby Charlton, George Best, Eric Cantona and their ilk, become a pit of despair.How typical of the often amoral, moneybags world of top flight football that in recompense for failure, Mourinho will pocket a reported £15million redundancy cheque. No wonder he was smirking as he was driven away from the club’s training ground for the last time in a friend’s Jaguar.How, then, did it come to this? Why did Mourinho, who had swaggered into the hot-seat at this football institution with a characteristic boast (‘giant clubs are for the best managers and I feel I’m ready for it’) sink so low that he might have been frogmarched out of town by disillusioned supporters had he not been fired?          Mourinho had fallen out with one of his main players Paul Pogba, pictured, who posted this image on Instagram shortly after he heard about this manager\u0027s dismissalNo doubt his managerial shortcomings will be dissected ad infinitum on sports pages across the world.Apart from his own inability to handle failure, there were the cataclysmic clashes of ego with his star players, such as French World Cup winner Paul Pogba, who cost United an obscene £89million, yet sat on the substitutes’ bench where he was dumped humiliatingly by his manager, and watched sullenly as the team was thumped by long-time rivals Liverpool on Sunday.Moribund, out-dated and unimaginative tactics have also seen Mourinho left behind, at the age of 55, by more forward-looking managers. The surliness of his pitch-side behaviour became a default position. It contrasted embarrassingly with the exuberance of managers such as Liverpool’s perpetually smiling German, Jurgen Klopp.Yet according to seasoned Mourinho-watchers, there was another reason for his detached, and frequently tortured-looking demeanour.Like most traditionally great footballing cities, Manchester has always prided itself on the links between the players and the club.The legendary Sir Matt Busby lived in a red-brick house in the suburb of Chorlton-cum-Hardy Sir Alex Ferguson played in his local pub’s quiz in Wilmslow, and dined in neighbourhood restaurants.Yet Mourinho remained aloof, refusing to live among the workaday Mancunians who paid his eye-watering £12million a year salary.          Mourinho, pictured with his daughter MatildeHis bosses, it is said, repeatedly attempted to persuade him to buy or rent a home in the Cheshire commuter-belt. Yet throughout his time in Manchester, he stayed isolated in a penthouse suite, in the five-star Lowry Hotel. He rarely ventured out and became ever more reclusive, dining on room-service and takeaways.After matches on Saturdays, he would leave Manchester as quickly as he could to catch the train to London, where his wife Matilde, and their two children (his 22-year-old daughter is a fashion graduate, and his 18-year-old son was recently rejected by Fulham, where he had hoped to become a goalkeeper) still reside in a Belgravia home.A devout, Catholic family man, it was said that he did not wish to uproot them yet again — his wanderlust and quest for soccer immortality having taken him from Portugal to London (twice), Milan and Madrid.His concern for his family’s welfare was reinforced after an horrific experience a few years ago when a burglar tried to break into their London home while Mourinho watched the European Championships final on TV.Alternatively, it may be that Mourinho, a restless man, forever looking for a new challenge — and with it a bigger salary package — never envisaged staying more than a few years in Manchester.Perhaps, deep down, for all his outward bravado, he recognised the impossibility of building an all-conquering dynasty to compare with that of Ferguson’s 26-year spell as manager.For he is said to have harboured insecurity since his ambitions to be a great player in his own right were thwarted when he was just 19 years old.Then there is his domestic life. Inevitably, given that he has been living 200 miles away from Matilde since the summer of 2016 and his status as a sex symbol, there have been numerous, although unfounded whispers about the state of his marriage.Mourinho and Matilde, or Tami as he calls her, have been married for almost 30 years, and he never tires of expressing his adoration for her. They recently had one another’s names, and those of their children, tattooed on their wrists.          Mourinho spent his time in a luxury penthouse suite in the Lowry Hotel in Manchester ‘My wife trusts me, my wife knows me, she has been with me since I was 17 and she was 15,’ he said recently, harking back to their days as college sweethearts in the Lisbon suburb of Setubal, where their families dined at the same restaurant.A workaholic who has few, if any hobbies apart from keeping in shape, drinking vintage wine, fine dining, and spending his evenings watching football videos, Mourinho becomes similarly passionate when discussing the joys of family life.‘I love to go to the supermarket, to do the shopping and go with my kids to do the things they like to do, to go to a movie and help with the homework,’ he has said. ‘I love to be normal.’There is no doubting his familial pride and devotion.Indeed, when his 53-year-old wife was seriously ill and underwent surgery in a hospital, in Portugal, two years ago, he hired a private jet to be at her side.When he stepped up to collect a prestigious GQ Men of the Year award, his daughter (though he looked askance at her skimpy dress) was on his arm. His son, it’s been reported, is being groomed as a football coach.All that said, there is one past episode that Mourinho never mentions. In 2007, a boutique owner named Elsa Sousa told the Mail on Sunday of the lengthy affair they allegedly conducted when he was managing his first club, in the small Portuguese town of Leiria, and living away from his family.          Manchester United bosses had wanted Mourniho to buy or at least rent a house while in Manchester, however, he preferred to stay in the Lowry hotel at a cost of £500,000She claimed they lived together so openly that she was mistaken for his wife, and that he promised to leave Matilde for her, but reneged on his promise for fear of losing his children.In an amusing aside, she also claimed he had a craving for chocolate biscuits, saying he’d munch them to celebrate a victory and even kept them beside their bed. For his part, Mourinho has never sought to deny her story.Gossips went into overdrive again in February, when a red-top tabloid reported that he had ‘struck up a friendship’ with a 36-year-old ‘bubbly, attractive, super-fit’ policewoman.However, she responded by saying it was all a smear invented by someone with a vendetta against her, adding: ‘I’d tell you the whole story but you probably won’t be interested because there is no sex involved.’In a typically forthright TV interview Mourinho, had already described his goldfish-bowl existence at the Lowry Hotel ‘a disaster’ because he was followed whenever he left his sixth-floor suite, and stories such as this can hardly have helped matters.It might explain why, in recent months, he has barely left the hotel except on work-related business, preferring to spend his evenings with a cabal of mainly Portuguese backroom staff, among them his ‘technical scout’ and close friend Ricardo Formosinho, who drove him away from the club’s training ground for the final time yesterday.In recent weeks, the word among Manchester’s football fraternity was that he had come to loathe his life in the city, and longed to escape. So is this last we shall see of Mourinho?Certainly it is difficult to see him managing another British club again. For despite winning three Premier League titles (an achievement he petulantly signalled in October by brandishing three fingers at the fans), there appears no place for his dictatorial managerial style in the modern game, where the whims of pampered players with powerful agents hold sway. Nor does he any longer seem capable of commanding the loyalty and respect required to build a group of talented iniduals into a team who will sweat blood for him.Perhaps that owes something to his inherent arrogance and sense of entitlement.But whatever truth, the irresistibly charming and handsome young man who arrived here, 14 years ago, has not only lost his job, he has succeeded in turning almost everyone who follows football against him.Back then, it must be admitted, he really was quite special.Today, as he prepares to bank his colossal redundancy check for leaving the once-mighty United as a team of also-rans, he seems decidedly average.Mourinho’s £15m reward for failure: He seemed tailor made for the biggest job in British football but Jose crashed and burned amid dressing room bust-ups and on-field embarrassmentsBy ARTHUR MARTIN AND JAKE HURFURT FOR THE DAILY MAIL With his track record of success – and a love of publicity and Armani suits – he seemed tailor made for the biggest job in British football.Jose Mourinho had, after all, even called himself The Special One long before being appointed the Manchester United manager.But the Portuguese manager’s love affair with English football appeared over yesterday after he was unceremoniously sacked by the Old Trafford club. All that remained was his trademark smile – perhaps because he is in line for a payout of about £15million.      Jose Mourinho signed on as Manchester United manager in July 2016 at Old Trafford            Mourinho, pictured here after being sacked yesterday, was earning £12-million a year as Manchester United managerMourinho, who earned £12million a year, lived in the Riverside Suite at the five-star Lowry Hotel for his 895 days in Manchester at a cost of about £537,000, or £600 a night.The hotel is popular choice for visiting pop stars including Rita Ora, Robbie Williams and Justin Bieber.During his ill-fated spell in the city, Mourinho’s wife Matilde, daughter Matilde and son Jose Mario Jr chose to remain in their rented London townhouse in Belgravia, where a maid and a security guard look after them. The 55-year-old manager may now return to his home in the Portuguese city of Setubal amid widespread speculation that he will not coach a British club again.Mourinho was summoned to a crisis meeting at Manchester United’s training ground at 9am yesterday when executive vice chairman Ed Woodward gave him his marching orders.He emerged three hours later, having shaven, and checked out of his luxurious hotel before heading to London.The move saw United’s share price on the New York Stock Exchange soar by about 5 per cent in the first two hours of trading, adding $150million (about £119million) to the club’s overall value.The manager appeared relaxed and even lowered the window of his Jaguar F-PACE to shake hands with one of the regular Manchester paparazzi and said: ‘Thanks guys, good luck.’ Asked how he was holding up, Mourinho replied: ‘OK, my friend,’ as he posed for photographs.The decision to sack him was made on Monday evening after he had presided over the club’s worst start to a season for 28 years. The club issued a terse statement in which it said Mourinho ‘has left the club with immediate effect’.It thanked him for his work at Manchester United and wished him success in the future – but offered him no praise for his successes, albeit modest. By the time of his departure most of the players had already turned on him.The players reacted to a recent poll showing that 90 per cent of them wanted the manager to leave by asking each other: ‘Who are the 10 per cent that want him to stay?’During his turbulent two-and-a-half years at the club, Mourinho brought in 11 players at a combined cost of around £400million.Among those was Frenchman Paul Pogba who was bought for £89million in August 2016, then a world record fee for a footballer. At the time Mourinho admitted that the deal was further proof football had gone ‘crazy’.Their relationship turned sour within months and yesterday Pogba, 25, appeared to mock Mourinho’s downfall on his Instagram account.It is a spectacular fall from grace for one of the most mercurial, and controversial, managers in the modern game.He became widely known as The Special One when he arrived in the UK in June 2004 after Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich signed him to manage Chelsea for three years. During his first press conference, Mourinho said: ‘Please don’t call me arrogant, but I’m European champion and I think I’m a special one.’He brought swagger and style to the world of football management by wearing a tailored suit and Armani overcoat on the touchline. Previously, managers had tended to wear either knackered tracksuits or shapeless overcoats.Mourinho also brought success and trophies to the clubs he managed. Controversy was never far away, however.As he neared the end of his second spell at Chelsea, team doctor Eva Carneiro claimed Mourinho shouted the Portuguese phrase ‘filha da puta’, which means ‘daughter of a whore’, as she ran on to the pitch against his wishes to treat an injured player.Dr Carneiro, who claimed constructive dismissal against Chelsea, also reached a discrimination settlement against Mourinho.

The watchdog used statistical modelling to predict ‘expected’ patterns in degree attainment, taking into account factors such as students’ prior qualifications, subject studied, ethnicity and gender.It discovered evidence of ‘unexplained’ grade inflation at a staggering 84 per cent of institutions.This was either relative to the rest of the sector or to the universities’ prior levels.But 52 per cent (77) of providers had a ‘statistically significant unexplained increase’ in first-class degrees, relative to both the sector and their own previous levels of awards. This includes the University of Surrey, where 50.1 per cent of degrees were classified as firsts in 2016-17, compared to 22.9 per cent in 2010-11.The OfS found that over half of the proportion of firsts (27.3 percentage points) awarded in 2016-17 is ‘unexplained’ in relation to factors such as students’ qualifications on entry. At the University of East Anglia, 38.9 per cent of degrees were firsts in 2016-17 compared to 13.4 per cent in 2010-11.Of this 2016-17 proportion, half – 19.3 percentage points – was ‘unexplained’. And at the University of Huddersfield, the proportion of firsts has more than doubled from 15 per cent in 2010-11 to 37.9 per cent in 2016-17.Of this 2016-17 proportion, around two-thirds – 25.9 percentage points – could not be explained by students’ prior attainment and other factors. Between 2010-11 and 2016-17, the largest percentage increases in firsts were at University College Birmingham (up 225.7 per cent) and Leeds Trinity University (up 220.8 per cent).          The 2.2 degree award is now almost extinct at certain universities, said the Office for Students (stock image)The analysis also shows that in 2010-11 just 6.4 per cent of students who gained below CCD at A-level went on to achieve firsts at university, compared to 18.3 per cent in 2016-17. And at nine universities, including Surrey, the combined proportion of firsts and 2.1s awarded exceeds 90 per cent. Among 20 English Russell Group universities, at least 82 per cent of degrees awarded are now firsts or 2.1s. Overall, the percentage of first and upper second-class degrees awarded has increased from 67 per cent in 2010-11 to 78 per cent in 2016-17. The percentage of first-class degrees has increased from 16 per cent to 27 per cent over the same period.The OfS has a range of possible sanctions against institutions including fines, suspension and the stripping of degree-awarding powers. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, yesterday said it was ‘fundamentally important’ that degrees ‘hold their value over time’. She warned that the sector ‘must quickly get to grips with this issue’. She added: ‘If they do not take action, we will use our powers to drive change.’Alistair Jarvis, of Universities UK, insisted that institutions are ‘already taking steps to tackle grade inflation’.

Plastic pollution isn’t confined to Britain’s shores. It is a global catastrophe.Across the world, humans are exposed to harmful plastic — consuming particles in fish, swallowing it in drinking water and even breathing it in from the air. Everyone with a conscience wants to do something to turn the tide on plastic.But it’s hard to imagine how vast the problem is. Think of this: the amount of plastic that would fit into the average council refuse lorry is dumped into the ocean every single minute of every day.Scientists now estimate that if we do not act, by 2050 our oceans will contain more plastic than fish. There are already 150 million tons of plastic in the seas, but the horrifying prediction is that this could treble in the next seven years.The figures are simply incomprehensible, but we have to try to make sense of them. Since 1950, a colossal 8.3 billion tons of plastic has been produced (that’s 220 million tons per year). This immense volume of plastic has to end up somewhere. It will not just magically disappear.Discarded plastic is forming giant floating ‘islands’ called gyres in parts of the ocean where the currents naturally swirl. The North Pacific Gyre, which has been nicknamed the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, occupies an area twice the size of France.InspireIt’s a crisis, but it is one we can overcome if we work together. That’s why I am so pleased Environment Secretary Michael Gove is considering a ban, within the next year, on plastic straws, cotton buds and drink stirrers. All of these products can be manufactured with environmentally friendly materials instead.These measures have been driven by the British public’s desire to see action against plastic pollution. The Daily Mail’s own decade-long campaign in the UK has been a considerable factor in shaping government thinking and legislation, especially with the introduction of the 5p charge for plastic shopping bags.The way in which the Mail involved its readers in its Great Plastic Pick-Up campaign this summer — where teams of ordinary people, joined by the Prime Minister, came together to rid their area of plastic litter — shows how the media can inspire people throughout the world to do their bit to help.Everyone has a part to play. The more each of us does, the more governments around the globe will take notice and act.When I was elected in August to be President of the UN General Assembly, I promised the 193 member states that I would launch a global campaign to dramatically reduce plastic pollution. And I knew I would have to lead by example.To make a start plastic bottles have been replaced by re-usable metal containers in our offices. It’s surprising how one change can set a whole campaign in motion. Banning them in my office encouraged me to think more about plastic bottles, ones we may all have seen tossed casually aside.          \u0027Plastic pollution is a catastrophe on a scale that’s difficult to grasp\u0027. This photo taken on June 1, 2018 shows a cow resting on the banks of a sewage drain canal full of garbage in the Taimur Nagar slum area in New DelhiEvery woman\u0027s worst nightmare: Reveller making her way home...Share this articleWhen a bottle is thrown away thoughtlessly, it’s likely to begin a deadly journey — into a gutter or a sewer after a rainstorm, then into a river and finally into the sea. That’s where 80 per cent of our plastic waste ends up.Eventually that plastic bottle will disintegrate into tiny fragments in the ocean. It will break down into particles so small they can be ingested by fish which, in turn, are caught and eaten by a human being. That’s a food chain nobody wants to be part of.A study revealed on the front page of the Mail in September showed it could already be ‘impossible’ for people to avoid eating, drinking and breathing in plastic, with potential harmful effects. Microplastic particles are entering our bloodstream and lymphatic system, and even reaching the liver.Researchers at the Medical University of Vienna found hundreds of microplastic pieces in stool samples from every person in the study. It is proof that plastic pollution is far more pervasive than previously realised.Even the scientists were shocked. ‘I did not expect that each sample would prove positive,’ said the lead researcher.This underlines the importance of immediate action. I want to see the bottle ban I’ve put in place in my office implemented across the UN organisation and beyond.This year, our campaign became a global drive, which will culminate in an international event planned for 2019.Some large companies are already banning plastic bottles, straws, shopping bags, cups, and food packaging.PressureWe have seen this with McDonald’s phasing out the use of plastic straws in the UK, as well as Starbucks piloting the use of paper straws.Likewise, many coffee shops offer discounts if customers bring their own cups.Without public pressure and the support of papers like the Mail, it may have taken longer to get there.All of these measures are promising, but they are not nearly enough.Governments must introduce legislation that bans or imposes levies on single-use plastics, switching to biologically sourcing material. This is where the United Nations comes in. And it’s where I can use my special convening powers as President of the UN General Assembly, to work towards our goal of banning single-use plastics.As our global campaign takes shape, I’m aiming to visit areas facing plastic problems in their water and on their land.Here at the United Nations, we will organise social media campaigns for a world free of single-use plastics. We will encourage industry to show how innovation can be profitable, can create new jobs and finally end plastic pollution.Last September in New York, the World Economic Forum launched a new partnership to halt the growth in global plastic pollution by 2025.It will collaborate with coastal communities battling waste to show how businesses and governments can put a stop to the global throw-away economy.Last year, more than 200 nations pledged to end plastic waste at the United Nations Environment Assembly.In April this year, the UK announced the Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance, and Canada — which this year holds the presidency of the G7 industrialised countries — has championed the issue.We have succeeded in tackling huge global problems in previous generations when the odds against us seemed insuperable. We’ve wiped out diseases such as smallpox, and reversed the damage that was being done to the ozone layer.None of this would have come about without the determination of people to make a difference. That’s why I believe this year we will really begin to turn the tide against plastic pollution. We have to act now. "},{"url":null,"title":"Expose claims Facebook allowed Netflix Spotify Amazon access users private information","story":"    A new New York Times expose has revealed that Facebook gave 150 companies access to hundreds of millions of users\u0027 data without their consent It also allowed Microsoft\u0027s search engine, known as Bing, to see the name of all Facebook users\u0027 friends without their consent. Amazon was allowed to obtain users\u0027 names and contact information through their friends, and Yahoo could view streams of friends\u0027 posts. As of last year, Sony, Microsoft, and Amazon could all obtain users\u0027 email addresses through their friends.  Facebook never received monetary payment for this kind of access, which was permitted even if its users had disabled all data sharing on their profile. It has argued that these major companies were merely acting as an extension of Facebook, which is why any information that a user shared with friends on the site could be shared with the companies without their consent.           Facebook gave Netflix, Spotify, and the Royal Bank of Canada the ability to read, write, and delete Facebook users\u0027 private messagesAnd Facebook denied on Tuesday night that these companies misused users\u0027 data, although it did not touch on the Times\u0027 revelation of just how much data their partners were given access to in the first place. \u0027Facebook\u0027s partners don\u0027t get to ignore people\u0027s privacy settings, and it\u0027s wrong to suggest that they do,\u0027 Steve Satterfield, the site\u0027s director of privacy and public policy, said in a statement.    Satterfield also told the Times that none of Facebook\u0027s partners had violated users\u0027 privacy or Facebook\u0027s 2011 Consent Agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, in which it promised that Facebook users would need to give permission before their data could be shared with other companies.  But Facebook struck data sharing deals with a number of major companies - deals that helped bring in new users and, as a result, drove up its advertising revenue. Facebook\u0027s \u0027People You May Know\u0027, a friend suggestion tool on the site, was one such feature in which the social media giant utilized data acquired by its partners. The tool has been controversial since it was introduced in 2008, sometimes suggesting connections between estranged family members or even a victim and their harasser.   Facebook\u0027s business partners were exempted from the site\u0027s usual privacy rules through the deals, according to internal records. The deals - made with tech businesses, online retailers, automakers, entertainment sites, and media organizations - date back to 2020 and all were still active in 2017. Some still remained in effect this year, as the Cambridge Analytica scandal plagued Facebook and raised numerous concerns about how it was handling its users\u0027 data. Following the controversy, Zuckerberg told Congress in April that Facebook users now \u0027have complete control\u0027 over everything they share on the site.           Amazon was allowed to obtain users\u0027 names and contact information through their friends, and Yahoo could view streams of friends\u0027 postsBut an extensive investigation by the Times has revealed that wasn\u0027t the case as it interviewed more than 50 former Facebook employees and government officials and reviewed more than 270 pages of the company\u0027s internal documents. The Times also performed a number of technical tests to determine exactly what information was being passed between Facebook to its partner websites. Facebook made deals with over 60 makers of smartphones, including Apple. Records show that Apple devices could access users\u0027 contact numbers and calendar entries, even if those same users had disabled all sharing. Apple was also given the ability to hide the fact that its devices were asking for data from Facebook\u0027s users. And Yandex, a Russian social media company  accused of having ties to the Kremlin, could access Facebook users\u0027 unique IDs as recently as 2017 - despite the fact that Facebook had stopped sharing them with other applications for years due to security concerns. Facebook began dabbling in data sharing in 2009, suddenly making some of the information of 400 million of its users available to all of the World Wide Web. It also began sharing information about its users, including their locations and religion, to partners such as Microsoft. Facebook claimed this practice - which it dubbed \u0027instant personalization\u0027 - would help customize the internet to people\u0027s preferences and make the online world a more enjoyable and personal experience for everyone. But the FTC soon caught wind of what Facebook was doing and found that the social media giant had defied promises to keep its users\u0027 information private. Facebook entered into the consent agreement with the FTC, even hiring chief privacy officers and auditor Privewaterhouse Coopers to oversee its practices. But still, records show, the deals that Facebook had made with major companies persisted. Some were even vetted by Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. Two years after the consent agreement, Facebook had agreed to so many partnerships that a tool was built to turn this special access on and off.            The shocking expose comes as Sheryl Sandberg (pictured Tuesday) was doing damage control after a Senate Intelligence Committee report revealed that Russian-backed actors targeted African-American Facebook users in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential electionFormer employees revealed that the same privacy team touted to the FTC only had a limited ability to review these data-sharing partnerships. Facebook has claimed that most of these data partnerships were exempted from the FTC agreement because they were only working \u0027for and at the direction of\u0027 the social media site.   But that claim has been disputed by a number of former FTC officials.\u0027The only common theme is that they are partnerships that would benefit the company in terms of development or growth in an area that they otherwise could not get access to,\u0027 said former FTC chief technologist Ashkan Soltani. \u0027This is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,\u0027 added David Vladeck, who ran the FTC consumer protection bureau. \u0027I don\u0027t understand how this unconsented-to data harvesting can at all be justified under the consent decree.\u0027 Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg says the company needs to do...Mark Zuckerberg lost $15BILLION during a year of...Share this articleThe shocking expose comes as it was revealed that Zuckerberg has lost almost a quarter of his net worth following a year of scandals at the site. Meanwhile, Sandberg has been doing damage control this week after a Senate Intelligence Committee report revealed that Russian-backed actors targeted African-American Facebook users in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election.\u0027Facebook is committed to working with leading US civil rights organizations to strengthen and advance civil rights on our service.

It will be a system that will bring net migration down to more sustainable levels,\u0027 he said.\u0027If you look at the current level of migration, the latest stats show 273,000.

If you go back further than that it was much lower.\u0027What we want to do is bring it to a level where it is sustainable, in the sense that it meets first our economic need and at the same time, though, it is not too high a burden on our communities or on our infrastructure.\u0027\u0027Think Brexit just peaked!\u0027 Radio station caller says the...Theresa May \u0027tears up manifesto pledges on social care and...Share this articleAnnouncing his plans earlier, the Home Secretary said: \u0027We are delivering on the clear instruction to get control over our borders and will bring in a new system that works in the interest of the British people.\u0027It will be a single, skills-based immigration system built around the talent and expertise people can bring, rather than where they come from – maximising the benefits of immigration and demonstrating the UK is open for business.\u0027  Even as late as yesterday evening, it was unclear if the document would be unveiled as ministers struggled to resolve heated disagreements. As part of the blueprint: Migrants must earn at least £30,000 before they are allowed to come to Britain on five-year-long visas.But foreign workers on lower pay could be allowed in where occupations facing shortages or if they work for tech start-ups.Low-skilled migrants can get \u0027temporary\u0027 one-year visas if they have jobs – but once the permit expires they must leave the country for at least 12 months. To stop crops rotting in fields, farmers could hire low-skilled workers on seasonal visas. Freedom of movement for people will end, fulfilling a manifesto commitment. The controversial net migration target of 100,000 looked set to be axed – a move Mrs May resisted. Instead, levels are likely to be \u0027sustainable\u0027. Adam Marshall British Chambers of Commerce warned against restricting the number of skilled workers able to come to the UK with income rules.He told the BBC: \u0027This threshold is of huge concern, I had a call from our representative in Northern Ireland who said that a huge number of occupations would fall underneath the threshold and they won\u0027t get visas for their people.\u0027 Saffron Cordery, deputy CEO at NHS providers, said \u0027high skilled does not mean high paid\u0027 amid concern the rules will block European nurses from working in the NHS because starting salaries are far below the £30,000 threshold.She told the Today programme: \u0027You have got starting salaries for nurses at £23,000 - also for paramedics, midwives. Junior doctors starting salaries at £27,000, healthcare assistants at £17,000, all coming in way below that £30,000 cap.\u0027It is not just health workers, it is social care as well. We have to remember where the skills lay. They lay in those staff under £30,000.\u0027          Net immigration to Britain rose to 273,000 in the first half of 2018 despite a continued fall in arrivals from the EU according to ONS data out today (pictured). The Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill will crack down on welfare payments claimed by EU workers arriving after the end of December 2021.Under current Brussels rules, EU workers arriving under free movement rules can claim the same benefits as UK citizens.Official data from before the 2016 Brexit referendum showed that EU workers received more than £2.2billion in tax credits and housing benefits, £1.1billion in out-of-work payments and £700million in child benefit.But non-EU nationals on visas are not allowed to claim until they been given leave to remain or settlement – typically after about five years.EU citizens and their families who are already in Britain before the transition date will still be able to claim benefits. "},{"url":null,"title":"Third Canadian detained China Canadian media says citing ministry","story":"    Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou arrives at a parole office with a security guard in Vancouver on December 12.

Spanning the 60-odd years since teenagers first defined themselves in opposition to their parents’ values, Another Kind of Life looked at how photographers have explored marginality, whether imposed by mainstream society or self-expressed through gender, sexuality, identity or political rebellion.Among the many highlights were Larry Clark’s still shocking 60s series Tulsa, a powerful, morally ambiguous insider’s exploration of the junkie life, and Philippe Chancel’s seldom seen street photographs of young anti-fascist rockabilly gangs in 1980s Paris. Among the surprises was the work Paz Errázuriz, a Chilean schoolteacher turned activist, who, for a time, lived among and photographed a group of male cross-dressers who worked as prostitutes throughout the dark days of the Pinochet regime. The show roamed far and wide, from Igor Palmin’s images of Russian hippies to Seiji Kurata’s portraits of yakusa gangsters in Tokyo, making it a draw for photography buffs, pop culture scholars and curious millennials.Foam, AmsterdamMasahisa Fukase, who died in 2012 having been in a coma for 20 years following a fall, is best known for his iconic photo book, Ravens. This retrospective, which delved deep into his posthumous archives, was the first chance to see the full range of his work. Alongside rare colour polaroids from the Ravens series, the exhibition looked at his various family projects, including the elegiac Memoirs of Father and his obsessive studies of his wife, Yoko. A deep sense of melancholy ran through the show, leavened by his prescient series of performative proto-selfies, Bukubuku, taken in his bathtub.Foto Colectania, Barcelona Perhaps the most beautifully realised show of the year, In Search of Beauty was a deftly curated overview of the work of the reclusive genius of American colour photography. Leiter’s painterly New York street scenes, all made within a few blocks of his Manhattan apartment, are deservedly revered, but this exhibition also included the languorously erotic black and white portraits he made of his longtime partner-muse, Soames Bantry, and her many model friends. They cast a seductive spell: abstract silhouettes and reclining nudes glimpsed though doorways and screens. What captivated throughout was his masterly eye for colour and composition.Jeu de Paume, ParisOver five decades, American photographer Susan Meiselas has steadily built a reputation as one of the greatest living documentary photographers. Mediations traced that journey, beginning with several of her early black and white series from the early to mid 70s, including Prince Street Girls, her portrait of a gang of Italian-American friends in downtown Manhattan, and the more edgy Carnival Strippers. Her two epic social documentary series on the Sandinista revolution and the diaspora of the Kurds, both shown here, remain classics.The Photographer’s Gallery, LondonIn her too-short life, British photographer, Tish Murtha, who died in 2013 aged 56, made grittily poetic pictures of working-class life, acutely observing a world she knew firsthand. Series such as Elswick Kids, Juvenile Jazz Bands and Youth Unemployment merge the intimate and the edgy, the latter series in particular an evocation of teenage boredom and disaffection back when working-class kids had a lot more time to waste. There is a sense of empathetic anger implicit in many of her pictures despite her tender, observant eye. A quietly powerful testament to one of British photography’s defiant free spirits.Barbican, LondonThe iconic status of Dorothea Lange’s portrait of Florence Owens Thompson, now universally known as Migrant Mother, has tended to overshadow the consistent quality of the epic body of work she made in her lifetime. This retrospective made clear just how creatively productive she was, ranging over 15 series from her early studio portraits of friends and fellow artists through her documentation of Japanese-American internment camps to the photographs she made of the west of Ireland and its people in the mid-1950s. In a separate gallery, Time Folds provided a survey of the work of contemporary British documentary photographer Vanessa Winship, whose quietly resonant portraits and landscapes explore belonging, exile and memory in a hauntingly melancholic way.Hayward Gallery, LondonThe grandstanding German artist has established himself as perhaps the most significant image-maker of our digitally mediated times. This epic retrospective traced his singular journey from the Dusseldorf school of clinically detached documentary to a place where the word photography hardly suffices, such is the extent of the technologically enabled post-production in his recent works. If you want to grasp the scale of the daily traffic of goods in an Amazon warehouse or sense the epic human drama of the stock exchange floor, Gursky evokes the pulse of global capitalism like no other. Unreal on many levels, his images nevertheless reflect the hyperreality of our turbulent times.Les Rencontres de la Photographie, ArlesAn inspired pairing of two underappreciated European flaneur-photographers made for one of the highlights of this year’s Arles’ photography festival. Joan Colom is best known for his clandestine, black and white street portraits of the Barrio Chino red light district of Barcelona – grainy, evocative shots of sex workers and their male customers and pimps. His less-seen colour photographs of the same nocturnal milieu received a welcome outing here. They worked wonderfully alongside Jane Evelyn Atwood’s images of 1970s Pigalle, where peeps shows and prostitutes were a defining part of the everyday landscape of the harsh, working-class streets. Both photographers created surprisingly poetic extended portraits of these seedy urban neighbourhoods.Tate Modern, LondonLangdon Coburn’s “vortographs”, which he started producing in 1916, were blurred geometric arrangements of light and shadow created using mirrors. They set the tone for an exhibition that traces the history of abstract photography, images created either by manipulating light and chemicals or by distorting and fragmenting the subject. Man Ray and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy were among the pioneering artists included here, but it was good to see experimental women photographers such as Garmaine Krull and Imogen Cunninghan afforded the respect they deserve. La Cité, ParisAway from the full-on commercial thrust of the main event in the Grand Palais, Thomas Mailaender’s selection of very strange images, objects and periodicals from his extensive archive made for some much needed light relief during this year’s Paris Photo Fair. Mailaender’s imagination tends towards the darkly humorous with a side order of the surreal and the grotesque. Here, a photograph of Big Foot was exhibited alongside an “authentic” Turin shroud, both purchased on eBay. Another highlight was a fan’s album of photographs of Grace Kelly, each one augmented by Tippexed tears. Obsessive, tasteless, funny – and strangely enlightening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87dff4b3f305c017a403bd39fd7324f582506908/0_96_4464_2678/master/4464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4cc8f461bf10bd491816e9bfe33c235","title":"share your best photographs of the week with us","story":"We’re highlighting the best reader photography in print in the letters pages of the .

Audacious, chilling and darkly playful, her thought experiment about belonging and otherness is quick to ignite, but admirably slow to reveal the full extent of its dystopian proposition.The action begins in a queasily familiar near-future America where “democracy” is administered by an acronym-loving bureaucracy appointed by the Patriot Party, the only political show in town. Citizens are graded by ST (Skin Tone), and schoolchildren must memorise Science Facts such as “cancer is caused by negative thoughts” and “the average female IQ is 7.55 points lower than the average male IQ”.But in a society that mistrusts its citizens, high IQs are a liability regardless of gender – as the precocious teenager Adriane Stohl discovers when her high school valedictorian address leads to charges of Treason Speech and Questioning an Authority. Sentenced to four years of “rehabilitation” in Exile, she is whisked back in time by means of a microchip implant and teleportation to awake like a reverse Rip van Winkle in 1959 Wisconsin. The brave newold world of twinsets, cumbersome Remington typewriters and the cold war could not be more different from the one that has banished her. Or could it?Anyone writing speculative fiction today runs the risk of their nightmare scenario becoming yesterday’s news before the book is published – which may account for Adriane’s skippy, breathless first-person narration her dashes, exclamation marks and broken sentences give the novel a slapdash quality. But its imaginative ambition, intellectual panache and propulsive story offer plenty of compensation.Awkwardly reincarnated as Mary Ellen Enright, a freshman at the fictional University of Wainscotia, Adriane gets painfully hair-rollered by well-meaning room mates, learns the word “girdle”, rediscovers handwriting and attends classes on BF Skinner, whose pronouncement that “a self is simply a device for representing a functionally unified system of responses” serves as the book’s sly epigram.Unable to forge friendships and suffering from the chronic stress of her double status as outsider and impostor, AdrianeMary Ellen falls gauchely and hard for the charismatic psychology professor Ira Wolfman. Is the expert on learned helplessness a secret fellow Exile from the future, as she suspects, or something else? Is she trapped in Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Plath’s The Bell Jar, the Wachowskis’ The Matrix, or Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror? Or is she just a human rat in a “Skinner Box”, doomed to press the same buttons and levers repeatedly in an effort to “make sense of the stimuli, to perceive a pattern amid randomness”? Most crucially, can she ever return to her past life in the future – and should she? Oates takes bleak relish in keeping the reader guessing, while deftly interrogating the novel’s central preoccupation: the voluntary shrinking of the human mind.The Nordic term Janteloven, coined by the Danish-Norwegian writer Aksel Sandemose in 1933 to satirise the mentality of small-town Denmark, enshrines a pervasive, crowd-generated totalitarianism that forbids anyone to seem, think they are, or actually be better than anybody else. Under Sandemose’s rules, extraordinariness, ambition and self-belief are deemed crimes against society, and as a result, pervasive self-censorship and militant mediocrity prevail. Since the brilliant Oates, like the brilliant Adriane, went to university in Wisconsin, one of several midwestern states where Scandinavians settled, it’s hard not to wonder how much retrospective personal rage fuels her exposé of America’s version of Janteloven.Tall poppy syndrome is a child of collective envy, the novel suggests and wherever tall poppies grow, there will be crowds wielding scythes. Whether the syndrome manifests as a survival mechanism in a future America where it’s “better to be a safe coward than a sorry hero”, or as the unrecognised cornerstone of intellectually stunted 1950s academia, Oates’s message is clear: any society that punishes exceptionalism in the name of egalitarianism is a dystopian one. In positing the real “hazard” of otherness as exposure to the crushing contempt of a conformist majority, she is highlighting not so much the banality of evil as the evil of banality. As time-travelling, universally applicable propositions go, mediocre it is not.• Liz Jensen’s The Uninvited is published by Bloomsbury. Hazards of Time Travel is published by 4th Estate.

Solar has been a huge success story, seeing 1m homes and 1,000 schools taking clean energy and climate action into their own hands,” said Neil Jones, a campaigner at the group.Green peer Jenny Jones said the step was a “very bad call”, while people took to social media to brand it “absolutely outrageous” and “shocking”.The change will not affect the 800,000-plus homes that have already fitted solar panels since the feed-in tariff scheme launched in 2010.The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was ending the export tariff, which provides a guaranteed price for all unused solar electricity, to minimise costs to all consumers. The policy did not align with its industrial strategy, it added.The government is understood to be preparing to announce a market-based replacement to the export tariff early in the new year, which would write the rules for how energy suppliers could buy the excess power, though they would not be mandated to do so.However, there is expected to be a hiatus between the export tariff’s demise at the end of March and any new regime, meaning new solar households will be giving power away for some time.The Solar Trade Association said the move was a blow to the industry, and it was wrong the government had made the decision before setting out its new plans.The change is one of a double whammy for solar power in the UK, with energy regulator Ofgem also announcing measures on Tuesday that will see solar households pay more for their energy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/067babb9b9b8d435d7d19481ba6e5be7e057b9d2/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edd4938534a27ccb7f9d83b8742e7d74","title":"bank of england reform spending targets nao","story":"Report says Bank moving in right direction but warns against underestimating scale of changeThe Bank of England must “bear down” on costs and ramp up reforms if it hopes to meet its own spending targets, the National Audit Office has said.The central bank has capped its staff numbers to 4,281 and committed to limiting spending – excluding pensions and the cost of producing banknotes – to £476m per year.While the NAO report said the Bank was “moving in the right direction”, it warned against underestimating the “scale of change” needed to meet its targets.That is despite the Bank’s City of London headquarters hosting about 800 empty desks on any given day, though it has now committed to increase desk sharing and occupancy by early 2020.Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: “The Bank of England has rightly recognised that its central services need reform and has started to take action. However, the Bank should not underestimate the scale of change required. Improvements will only be possible if staff across the Bank are encouraged to embrace a more cost-conscious culture.”The NAO acknowledged that changes will be harder to push through at a “relatively conservative institution” like the Bank of England, but urged the central bank to “step through the changes needed firmly and expeditiously, bringing its people with it”.“It will need to bear down on its existing costs as much as possible if it is to find the headroom needed for investment and live within its self-imposed spending cap,” the NAO added.The report comes as the Bank faces criticism over staff expenses after two of its US-based economic advisers racked up a £390,000 travel bill over two and a half years.It has since cut meal and hotel allowances and clarified when staff can book business-class flights as part of its first publicly released expenses policy. The Bank will also require greater detail in expense reports and force more of its directors to release their reports “proactively”.The central bank recently defended spending £100,000 on its summer party, saying it “carefully budgeted” for the lavish event that featured £58,000 worth of food and drink and over £27,000 on entertainment.Responding to the NAO’s latest report, the Bank’s chief operating officer, Joanna Place, said: “We welcome the NAO’s report and its conclusion that the bank is moving in the right direction.“Our existing transformation programmes provide a roadmap for how the Bank’s central services will operate in future. The recommendations contained in the NAO report will feed into these efforts to update and streamline those functions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0417fa8a15b31eeec9f0b873df707f5ee93b8fcc/0_142_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2d8e70d31b0c4e39343e7f1a21896e6","title":"markets federal reserve interest rate decision uk inflation business live","story":"Will America’s central bankers defy Donald Trump by raising interest rates today?Newsflash: Banking group Santander has been fined £32.8m by the UK financial watchdog, for a frankly shocking failure to handle the accounts and investments of deceased customers properly.The Financial Conduct Authority has imposed the penalty, after concluding that Santander had often failed to do the right thing when a customer died.Failings in its probate and bereavement processes meant that Santander sometimes didn’t transfer money to beneficiaries for several years.According to the FCA, there were weaknesses in Santander’s systems which:The FCA is also unhappy that Santander didn’t come clean about the problems .In a stern rebuke, it says:Santander did not notify the FCA of the nature or extent of the issues it faced, including the numbers of potentially affected customers and assets, and was selective in the information it provided.Accordingly, Santander’s conduct fell below the standards of openness and cooperation expected of an authorised firm.Italian bonds and stocks are rallying this morning, on relief that Rome has reached a peace deal with Brussels over its budget.Last night, the Italian Treasury announced it had reached a “a technical agreement with EU officials” which could avoid an “excessive deficit procedure” being launched against the eurozone’s third-largest member.Any deal still needs the approval of European commissioners, who meet later today. Plus, any budget changes would need to be passed by the Italian Senate. World stock markets have a decidedly edgy feel this morning, as investors wait for the Fed’s rate decision.GSK has agreed to spin off its consumer healthcare business in a £10bn joint venture with rival Pfizer.The FTSE 100 drug maker said that within three years of closing the deal, it will demerge and float the consumer health business, splitting GSK into two distinct businesses – one focused on consumer and the other on pharmaceuticals and vaccines.Investors around the globe will be watching Fed chair Jerome Powell tonight, when he explains tonight’s interest rate decision.Shares could soar, or slide, depending on the guidance that Powell gives for future rate hikes in 2019. Ditto the dollar.Naeem Islam of Think Markets explains:Market participants widely expect the statement to be somewhat dovish and the markets believe that going into 2019, the Fed isn’t going to be this aggressive because of the tighter financial conditions. Mr Powell is likely to indicate two or maximum three rates hikes in 2019. For investors, one to two rate hikes would be considered more dovish to neutral but two to three rate hikes would be aggressive because the economic indicators have started to flash warning light with respect to any aggressive monetary policy.In terms of trading the event, aggressive tone by the Fed would be negative for the equity market and the sell-off may become intense. The Dow Jones may take a nose e and the move could in the range of 300-500 points. However, a dovish statement could support the equity markets and it would restore some confidence so investors expect about 150-250 points move for the Dow on the back of this.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.To hike or not to hike, that is the question facing America’s central bankers today.The Federal Reserve had been certain to raise interest rates at its final meeting of 2018 today, in line with its policy of normalising monetary policy and tackling inflation.But Donald Trump has thrown clouds of uncertainty over the Fed, by repeatedly urging the Fed to leave interest rates alone.But the Fed will also update the markets on its plans for 2019, and many investors predict it will slash its forecasts for future rate hikes. Traders will be watching for dovish signs, such as the dropping of the phrase “further gradual rate rises” from the statement and a softening of the dot plot from three hikes to at most two. In short, if the Fed must hike today, and they will struggle to justify not hiking on current US economic strength then it will need to be a dovish hike to prevent the US equity markets dumping once more. The dollar has traded lower across the week in anticipation of a dovish hike.Earlier this week the US stock market fell to a 14-month low, while Britain’s FTSE 100 closed at a two-year low last night.It could confirm that retailers have been slashing prices in recent months, in an attempt to persuade shoppers to part with some cash."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f41cd0c27d6f0ccde770bc34d841b8888e32301/47_0_1860_1116/master/1860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81c36f2942c616eef5612e30d85b8e1f","title":"the dark history of santas city how rovaniemi rose from the ashes alvar aalto","story":"After the Finnish city was razed to the ground by the German army in the second world war, architect Alvar Aalto rebuilt it to a reindeer-shaped street grid. Then Santa came to town …As soon as you land at Rovaniemi airport in Lapland you see a reindeer. Not a real one, admittedly, but somebody in a Rudolf suit cheerily greeting passengers who have just arrived. A couple of miles from “Santa’s official airport” lies Santa Claus Village, an amusement park complete with elves, real reindeers, huskies, shops and restaurants that draws more than 600,000 visitors a year to this isolated spot at the edge of the Arctic Circle.There are reindeer everywhere in Rovaniemi: humans dressed as them at the airport, real ones pulling sleighs at Santa Claus Village and statues of them throughout the city centre.But the biggest is one few tourists notice: the reindeer head embedded in the Finnish city’s street plan. This was the work of Finland’s greatest architect, Alvar Aalto, when he rebuilt the Lapland’s capital after it was burned to the ground by the retreating German army during the second world war.In the 1930s, Rovaniemi was a quiet trading town of around 6,000 people until Russia invaded in 1939. The Finns fought off their aggressors in the brutal winter war of 1939-40, then allied withGermany for protection from further Russian incursions.The Germans created a base in Rovaniemi, doubling the town’s population. The Luftwaffe built an airfield – now “Santa’s official airport” – and a barracks that would become the site of Santa Claus Village.When the tide of war turned against the Axis powers, Russia told the Finns to expel the Germans as the German army departed in October 1944, they burned Rovaniemi to the ground. The residents had already been evacuated, many to Sweden, an arduous process in which 279 died. Another 200 died on their return to Rovaniemi, killed by mines the Germans laid to protect their withdrawal.This was the scene of desolation that greeted Aalto when he was commissioned by the Association of Finnish Architects to reconstruct the town in 1945. “He saw the burned town as an opportunity,” says Jussi Rautsi, a former planner and researcher at the Alvar Aalto Foundation. Partly inspired by the US president Franklin Roosevelt’s Tennessee Valley Authority, Aalto created a plan for all of Lapland – a land mass as large as Holland and Belgium combined.Aalto started by rebuilding the city with single housing units designed specifically for the climate in Rovaniemi and Lapland so they had as little north-facing facade as possible, and maximum external exposure to the sun in the south-west. In the 1950s his plan expanded beyond the city to include the entire region.Aalto factored in hydroelectric plants being built on the great rivers of Lapland, and commissioned impact assessments to see what the effect would be on the environment, indigenous Sami, reindeer herds, water basins and microclimate. “Nobody in the world had done such a plan,” says Rautsi. “It had all spatial levels: regional, entire town, parts of towns, neighbourhoods, even peripheral estates. This was the only plan of this magnitude in the world.”Aalto conceived Rovaniemi’s “reindeer antler” street plan in 1945: he simply imposed a reindeer head outline on existing topography, highlighting the natural shape of the land and the way the main roads and railway crossed. The football stadium became an eye, and the reindeer was born.Because the Finns had collaborated with the Germans, Rovaniemi could not get financial help from the US in the form of the Marshall Plan aid granted to other war-torn European countries. The Finns were also asked to pay “reparations” to Russia. However, some financial support did come from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and its patron Eleanor Roosevelt.In June 1950, Roosevelt wanted to visit the Arctic Circle, so the Finns built a log cabin near Rovaniemi airport in a week, furnished with chairs designed by Aalto. They told her it was in the Arctic Circle – although it was actually a little to the south. She sent a letter from the cabin to President Truman – said to be the first posted from the Arctic Circle. The cabin subsequently became a tourist attraction, visited by world leaders including the Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev and the Israeli prime minister Golda Meir.As tourism grew, Rovaniemi was rebuilt. The zoning aspect of Aalto’s plan – with different areas for commerce, residential and administration within the lines of the reindeer – was never fully realised. But he did design three buildings for the town’s municipal centre: an undulating concert hall, a town hall (completed by his wife after his death in 1976) and a library that is one of his finest works. There was also a Frank Lloyd Wright-style private home and a commercial block, and he built a small section of housing in the suburbs called Korkalorinne, featuring terraced housing and two large apartment blocks, modelled on the ideas of the British garden city movement.“This was affordable housing, following the social and healthy British garden city ideas,” says Rautsi. “Aalto remained faithful to these principles his entire life. Being well built, Korkalorinne is a popular place to live today. Concerning home size, Aalto’s main idea was easy to understand: people need more space inside in the dark and cold north than in the sunny south.”By 1984, Concorde was bringing visitors to Rovaniemi to see the Arctic Circle. That’s when local entrepreneurs created Santa Claus Village. According to Finnish myth, Santa actually came from Korvatunturi (“Ear Fell”), a rock formation shaped like an ear so Santa can hear the wishes of every child in the world. But Korvatunturi is remote and almost inaccessible: more than 200 miles to the north of Rovaniemi, which already had an airport.A rural-style wooden village was created around Eleanor Roosevelt’s cabin, offering shops, reindeer rides, a Santa, and a post office so visitors could send letters from the Arctic Circle. This is where every letter addressed to Father Christmas ends up – around 700,000 a year.By the 1990s, the Santa myth had taken over. Even part of one of the city’s nuclear bunkers – built for local citizens by the ministry of the interior – was turned into a subterranean Santa-themed park. Tourists – especially those from China, Israel and the UK, who make up most of the visitors – have taken the Finnish version of Santa to their hearts.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0380d6c51c1540441962cc95c48e3dd3f1e8622b/0_163_4960_2975/master/4960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bfaeb6a805cf05f3e904993923a53f0","title":"brexit britain westminster leave remain may corbyn","story":"Party loyalties were trumped by leave and remain, with whips left clueless. May and Corbyn will struggle to regain controlThe ancient Egyptians mummified their pharaohs and sealed them in pyramids. Russian revolutionaries pickled Lenin and displayed him in a mausoleum on Red Square, where he lies to this day. Now Brexit Britain has taken that macabre tradition to the next level, embalming its leader while she is still alive. A waxen Theresa May is entombed in office, still performing basic functions of a prime minister although the last animating breath of her authority has expired.To survive a confidence vote among Conservative MPs last week, May promised not to lead her party into a general election. The result of the ballot was still close enough to be perfectly disabling. She won enough support to continue as leader, but not enough to regain control of the agenda. An astringent European summit then bleached away hope of improvements to her Brexit deal. That document, like its sponsor, is trapped in parliamentary limbo.Labour ambivalence over Brexit is another chemical element in the embalming fluid. Jeremy Corbyn’s motion to censure the prime minister, tabled on Monday night, was a deliberately futile gesture. It avoided the specific wording required by law for a no-confidence vote to count as a trigger for bringing down a government. That meant May could ignore it. Corbyn is not ready to pull the proper no-confidence trigger because he expects the mechanism would misfire. A general election would then be ruled out, forcing the Labour leader to declare what he wants to happen next. And he doesn’t know.Labour’s activist base and a solid chunk of its MPs want a referendum. The shadow cabinet is split, and influential voices in the leader’s office insist that Brexit must go ahead, partly in fulfilment of hard‑left Eurosceptic doctrine and partly in the belief that Corbyn’s best route to No 10 passes through leave-voting constituencies.It is true that May would pass a Commons test of confidence. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s hardline Brexiteer groupuscule has said it would back her, despite orchestrating the failed putsch only a week ago. (So Rees-Mogg and friends think May is not good enough to lead their party but is still adequate enough as a prime minister for the rest of us.)That leaves parliament sliding towards the Christmas recess in a state of presumed confidence in May and presumed rejection of her Brexit deal, but without either proposition having been tested in the voting lobbies. Meanwhile, the leaders of the two main English parties are running out of ways to look busy when in fact they are just biding their time. Various factions of their parties clamour around them competing for attention, offering alleged routes out of the impasse. It is like watching owners trying to coax a pair of cats down from a tree, knowing they are stranded even when they show little sign of wanting to be rescued.Parliamentary deadlock reflects irreconcilable isions in the country, which could, I suppose, be celebrated as representative democracy in action. But the stalemate also exposes a different tension – between the whole Brexit process and the Westminster party system. Leave and remain opinion is not conveniently distributed between government and opposition, yet MPs are used to seeing issues in terms of neatly arranged rows of benches facing each other across the Commons floor. Everyone is struggling to map a new political geography of the chamber where, on the biggest issue, pro-European Tory cabinet ministers are closer in natural sympathy with Labour backbenchers than either group is with its own leader.One attempt to navigate this strange terrain brought a delegation of Labour MPs into Downing Street last week to meet David Lidington, cabinet office minister (effectively May’s deputy) and Gavin Barwell, the prime minister’s chief of staff. The encounter was denounced by Tory Brexiteers as a treasonous plot to arrange a referendum. Accounts I have heard of the meeting sound a lot more circumspect than that. May’s lieutenants are far from enthusiastic about a plebiscite. But they also need a sense of where the numbers in parliament are on various plan B ideas, and how well thought-through those plans are. As one pro-referendum MP puts it: “They have this Brexit mess tangled around their legs, and they just want to be free of it.”Corbyn can probably relate to that. He is also tangled in European questions that interest him little and put an emotional barrier between him and his fan base. He wants to get across the turbulent Brexit water to a safer shore where familiar campaigns on austerity and the NHS can resume. But how?On that question, John McDonnell is a key figure. The shadow chancellor has no affection for the EU, but he is also alert to the role that remainers will play in any pro-Corbyn electoral coalition. Above all, he craves power and seems at least open to persuasion that a referendum, which would split the Tories and energise Labour activists, could get him there.Neither May nor Corbyn want to be the one to say aloud that the best package available from the menu of EU relationships is the one labelled full membership. It is a little easier for the Labour leader, but he still needs a ladder to climb down with dignity from past assertions that the 2016 result is irreversible. That ladder might be a formal consultation with Labour members. Corbyn’s licence to U-turn comes in an envelope labelled “party democracy”. The climbdown is harder for May, but she could yield to parliamentary pressure for a referendum. As long as her deal is then on the ballot paper, she can truthfully say she never stopped believing in Brexit.Those scenarios depend on the meaningful vote being held and lost – and, for now, the prime minister insists it can be won. Unlikely, but not impossible. The more discussion there is of no Brexit and no deal, the more middle-ground Tories find things to like about May’s withdrawal agreement. It bundles Britain into a miserable tunnel of endless negotiation with Brussels, but many Conservative MPs would swallow that pill just to get out of the current mess without a referendum. So would a few Labour ones.The blurring of party lines makes the coming weeks especially hard to predict. The options cannot all be branded in red or blue colours. In the country, leave and remain identity are superseding traditional Labour and Tory loyalties. In parliament, the whips are clueless. Neither May nor Corbyn is capable of dictating a position to their MPs. They look more like passive objects of lobbying and manoeuvring.Politics is now driven by informal Commons coalitions trying to beat paths for the so-called leaders to follow. Whatever happens in 2019, wherever Britain ends up in its relations with Europe, 2018 will be remembered as the year that Brexit fought the old Westminster party system – and won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5308d8e4e5e26923afe8ed211635123e23d148de/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94eb73ea2b360db31aed8e18e6ec9f3e","title":"westminster brexit debates laws legislation","story":"This week in parliament, MPs have considered just one small piece of government legislation. They have also heard a statement from the prime minister about the weekend’s disastrous European council, and on Wednesday, it’s prime minister’s questions. On Thursday, they are off on their Christmas holidays. Another week gone, another four legislating days padded out – with apologies to the backbenchers raising important constituency issues in one-off short debates – with nothing more significant than an amendment to the Mental Capacity Act. It’s not just that Brexit is stalled in parliament. Westminster is stagnating completely.In the shadow of the immediate Brexit crisis, its opportunity costs – the bills left unprepared, let alone debated and passed – are not often considered. Theresa May insists that she has an ambitious programme of social reform she yearns to roll out to fulfil that early promise about a country more at ease with itself. In the aftermath of last week’s confidence vote, it was impossible to miss the real regret in her voice as she confirmed her intention not to lead the party into the next election. She will for ever be the Brexit prime minister. And not even someone as motivated by duty as May is without the vanity of yearning to be remembered for something positive.Brexit is sucking the life out of Whitehall. There is no mental bandwidth, no spare personnel, not even many worked-out ideas that don’t relate to the monstrous project. Every sinew is strained to wrestle against disaster. After the 2017 election, it was announced there would be a two-year parliamentary session to get all the Brexit bills through. The Queen’s speech, in the aftermath of Grenfell, was short not out of respect for the Queen’s advancing years but because the government had nothing to say, and even if it had, there was neither time nor – as important – money to do it with.But, I hear the diligent student of parliament protest, what of the daunting list of bills on the parliamentary website? Look a little more closely. It is mainly made up of unavoidable measures relating either to Northern Ireland’s failure to form a government or keeping taxes coming into the Treasury, and a handful of other stuff that keeps the country afloat. There’s Europe. And after that, it’s like there’s been a lock-in at the local with everyone challenged to come up with their own idea for a new law.Did you catch the debates on the Middle Level Act, which turns out to be about an alteration to navigation on the middle level (obviously) of the Fens in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk? Or notice the new law on what to do if you run over a cat – tell the police – and the two new laws about bats, rolling back bat protection in another sop to the housebuilders. There’s a bill making it an offence, as if it wasn’t already, to attack a retail worker, and another proposing a law against wearing medals with intent to deceive. So many of them are just short-lived jaunts from backbenchers, but seriously?It’s not easy managing business in a hung parliament. Yet back in the 1970s, when Labour had a theoretical majority of about three and a vast balance of payments deficit, the government managed to introduce child benefits, state earnings-related pensions, carers’ allowance, invalidity pensions and a mobility allowance, and reform tenants’ rights. It set up Acas, as well as the first police complaints board and the health and safety commission, and it turbocharged comprehensive education. It suffered countless defeats and in the end it ran into the ground. But it never lacked a sense of purpose.Or take the Edward Heath government immediately before that final Wilson administration: from 1970 to 1974, Heath’s majority was at least bigger, although still only 30. He also had a single huge and highly contentious ambition, which was to take Britain into Europe. In the end, he could only get the bill that we are about to repeal by conceding a free vote. He was prepared to do it because he believed so passionately in its purpose.Even in other circumstances, May could be crippled by her own political personality, her caution, her maladroit people management. But she is unquestionably restrained by the constitutional absurdity of having to balance two rival remits: on one hand the referendum, and on the other the general election result. Neither of them is in any way an adequate guide to the real question that has to be faced, which is the shape of Britain’s future relations with Europe, and the kind of country Britain itself wants to become. Her determination not to confront the reality of these huge questions, and the reluctance of the opposition to challenge her effectively, condemns Westminster MPs to wade through treacle, and the rest of us to hold our heads in despair.• Anne Perkins is a former deputy political editor of the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97ad9f6bf9b5ff09e1e8d143d71a1eea0ffc7080/0_0_1787_1072/master/1787.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb1569c2d44e7932338569cb1a251643","title":"drab to fab six ways christmas party ready hair clips matt red lipstick sparkly socks festive fast","story":"Statement hair clips, matt red lipstick and sparkly socks – how to transform an everyday outfit into something festive, fastParty season is reaching its peak but you’re all out of jazzy wardrobe ideas – sound familiar?

Lawrence has hardly been out of the spotlight while Granik has been a little forgotten. Well, this superlative film has brought her back. Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie play Will and Tom, a military veteran and his 13-year-old daughter who are living a Thoreau-type guerrilla existence in a huge national park near Portland, Oregon. They are trained and disciplined: they have a secret camp with tarps and cooking implements and they know how to avoid the authorities. Periodically, Will sneaks into the city to pick up his free prescription for painkiller meds, which he sells on the black market in order to buy food and supplies. It seems like the ideal setup, but one day they are spotted, and things come to a crisis.Will and Tom’s apparent belief in an eternal, Edenic present is striking. There is no sense that either have thought about what it is going to mean when Tom gets too old to share a tent with her dad (surely that moment has already arrived?) or when she wants to meet people her own age. And that question is brought into sharp focus when they are captured – there is hardly any other word for it – and subjected to psychiatric assessment. In some ways, the clinical coldness of this assessment is exactly the kind of soullessness that they were trying to get away from. And yet the assessment is asking them to think about their lives in ways they had perhaps avoided.In any case, being caught is evidently an occupational hazard: they know how to fake being compliant, going along with the idea of being rehabilitated into society, before discreetly slipping away. It’s a film with things to say about nature and our relationship to it, and how people who do not want to consume, to produce, to surf the waste-byproducts of economic growth that despoil the natural world, should not be labelled as eccentrics or dropouts or tramps. Yet neither is it sentimental about what the father is putting his daughter through. The performances from Foster and McKenzie are wonderful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa307387a798f9a28103fa69621acd98c5ad8e39/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3e175083499d0d3f6ae3e09cec7bc1d","title":"new rules christmas dinner dont ask yorkshire puddings always wear party hat","story":"There’s no need for open warfare over the turkey – as long as we all respect some basic guidelines about how to choose, prepare and consume the feastThere is an exact moment that Christmas Day tensions peak: 12.56pm. In 2013, Magimix found it was at this point, after an average four-and-a-half hours of cooking, that, as frazzled hosts start to bring the dinner together, once happy homes from Aberdeen to Hastings kick-off like Gordon Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares. It need not be like this. Not if we all respect some basic rules about how to do Christmas dinner right. Read on and merry Christmas … hopefully.“Come on,” you say. “It’ll be great.” It won’t. Your hassle-free Christmas dinner means choosing from a set menu of high-profit, easy-to-serve dishes seasoned with the salty tears of bitter, orced chefs and served by disengaged young staff only here because of student debt. It is £50 a head to eat in a ropey chain pub, north of £200 to go “posh”. Everyone will hate you for it.Do not passive-aggressively announce you are “doing” Christmas, regardless of how inconvenient it is for everyone to drive, sleep over or cram into your flat. It is their Christmas, too.Whether that be on smoked salmon and champagne or a whole Cadbury’s selection box (because Christmas), make sure it is in good time. It is demoralising for hosts when bloated guests arrive protesting they are not hungry.On Christmas Day you are free, if not obligated, to get on it early. A poll commissioned by the ginmakers Mason’s reports that we start drinking on average at 11.54am, which is hugely beneficial to our collective enjoyment of the day. Hungover? Hoist yourself out of that despondency. Love Christmas? A nip will heighten your excitement. Despise this forced jollity? Magically, alcohol will make it tolerable, and you tolerable to other people.On Christmas Day, social media is a wasteland populated by tragic stragglers wishing their families “Merry Christmas!” on Twitter (you live with them, just shout upstairs) posing with their gifts on Instagram or posting on Facebook from a sleeping bag in the Boxing Day sales queue outside Next. Staring at a screen on Christmas Day, therefore, is not just rude, it is depressing. The people you love are here IRL. Enjoy them. Failing that, read a book.... with half-hearted offers of help, booze that needs stashing or constant reminders about who won’t eat dark meat or sprouts. It is infuriating.There has been a rash of news stories this year about people charging their families for Christmas dinner. The typical price is £30 a head, prompting one Mumsnet user to declare: “OMG! No! Fuck, that is horrible.” It certainly seems provocative, particularly if, as one couple told the Daily Mail, they price it to turn a profit. However, in an age of rising food costs (last Christmas, the average UK family spent £225 on food and drink), rampant gluttony (we eat on average 6,000 calories on Christmas Day) and soaring expectations (one woman told This Morning she spent £500 feeding her tribe), it raises the question of how we should share the financial burden. Money need not change hands. Instead, in a sensitively Marxist way (“To each according to need, from each according to ability”), a list of shopping and jobs (veg prep, bringing dessert etc) should be split among the party. Broadly, guests can then spend as much time or money as they wish on their tasks. The host must start a WhatsApp group to coordinate this now obligatory in building anticipation before any event. Accept the tsunami of nonessential chat that will ensue. Count to 10. It is Christmas.Confusingly, Christmas dinner is a late lunch, served between 2pm and 3pm. Go into early evening and guests will be too hangry or drunk to appreciate it. Traditionalists will be livid (“Your grandad didn’t vote leave so he could eat Christmas dinner at 7pm, Claire! We’re not French”), as will those who suddenly find that eating clashes with the Strictly Christmas special.Wearing a Christmas party hat is a sign of true maturity. No, it is not cool. You never saw Che Guevara, Ian Curtis or Tupac in a festive titfer, but who are trying to impress? You are eating with your family. They already know you’re a pillock.For one day, after a year of such ision, could we reach beyond politics to find some deeper connection with our kin? Giving it to the in-laws with both barrels won’t make you feel better and will change nothing about Brexit, Trump or Syria.They are the support band here, the B-movie, the Bake Off Extra Slice. You want light dishes, served in modest portions that, from shop-bought paté to jerusalem artichoke velouté, can be brought by guests and served quickly with little fuss. The host will go berserk if you start commandeering kitchen space to prepare a complex winter salad.One type of potato is plenty. Serving mash and roasted spuds takes up precious plate-space better occupied by pigs in blankets. Beyond potatoes, the core Christmas vegetables are commonly acknowledged as sprouts, parsnips and carrots. They offer a clear balance of sweet, mineral and roasted vegetal inflections to the meat. Go beyond that (peas, red cabbage, broccoli, mangetout) and your plate gets very crowded, both literally and in its flavours.Serving everything on sharing platters sounds festive, but it is a fiddly mood-killer. Guests will spend 10 minutes in near silence, shuttling dishes around the table as the food goes cold.Think: a savoury combination of pork, sage, shallots, chestnuts and pancetta. Breadcrumbs, onions and herbs do not a stuffing make. Serve one of those monstrosities dominated by booze-soaked fruits and your guests will be justified in mutinying.The receptacle is irrelevant. The age of the gravy boat has sailed a measuring jug will do. Just keep it coming. It is all gravy, literally.This is not Sunday dinner, they only really go with beef and the host is frantic.From mulled wine and bread sauce to Christmas pudding, there are many heavy, egregiously spiced festive foods created for Victorian palates that contemporary Britons find revolting. A minority of self-appointed keepers of the Christmas spirit take that revulsion as a personal insult, as if declining an eggnog is Grinch-like subversion. No. It is just a vile drink.As host, you may still be stuffed, but you cannot neglect that cheeseboard or first leftovers sandwich. For many, it is more exciting than Christmas dinner itself.

Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino is the current frontrunner.On Tuesday Pochettino refused to rule himself out of the running. “I cannot answer this type of question, because this type of rumour happens in this business, in football,” he said.Given Pochettino signed a five-year deal in May, United would hope that paying up the value of his £8.5m-a-year contract would be the maximum required to smooth any deal.Yet with no buyout clause set in the contract Daniel Levy, the notoriously combative Spurs chairman, could ask for a considerably higher figure. Pochettino is yet to claim a major honour in nine years as a manager, having previously been in charge at Spain’s Eyol and Southampton.Other contenders for the position may include Zinedine Zidane, who won three consecutive Champions Leagues with Real Madrid, and Laurent Blanc, the former Paris-Saint Germain and France manager. Neither is in work.If Solskjaer, the Molde coach, is appointed as Mourinho’s temporary successor it would raise eyebrows given that in his sole previous experience of Premier League management the Norwegian took Cardiff down to the Championship in May 2014. On being sacked the following September the former United striker’s record was 16 defeats from 30 games and five wins, of which three were in the top flight.Just over a year ago Solskjaer described United as a dream job in an interview with United.no, the Manchester United Supporters’ Club Scandinavia.Late on Tuesday, the Norwegian Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, suggested a deal had been done, tweeting at Solskjaer: “Great day for Norwegian football. Good luck keeping control of the Red Devils.” The tweet was quickly deleted. That came after an update on United’s website seemed to highlight Solskjaer’s impending return.Under a video of Solskjaer celebrating his winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final, the headline read: “Solskjaer becomes our interim manager, 20 seasons after clinching the Treble with THAT goal.” The page was then taken down.Mourinho was removed 17 league matches into his third season, United having made their poorest start since 1990, sitting 19 points behind the leaders, Liverpool, and 11 from a Champions League berth.This was a major factor in Ed Woodward choosing to relieve the 55-year-old of the position he had held since May 2016. The executive vice-chairman relayed the decision to Mourinho at United’s training ground.Other reasons included the club’s disappointment at the evolution of the team and dour style of play, plus Mourinho’s performance in the transfer market, with his signing of 11 players at a cost of around £400m.There was also disquiet at his management of younger players and his reluctance to embrace United’s vaunted academy.Woodward’s determination to appoint the club’s first director of football in the face of opposition from Mourinho was a further sign of the manager’s weakening power. He will receive a payoff of around £15m.After three failed attempts to successfully replace Sir Alex Ferguson, United plan to use the time until the close season to assess their options. They want a manager who adheres to the club’s core attacking philosophy, can harness upcoming talent and help lift the mood following Mourinho’s often dour demeanour.Mourinho is said to have been taken by surprise at his dismissal, having fully expected to continue for the game at Cardiff on Saturday and he is believed to want to continue in club management.An indication of his mood was given when his confidant Eládio Paramés tweeted in Portuguese: “Moyes did not fit, Van Gaal did not fit, Mourinho did not fit. The only one that fits is Ed Woodward. Do you understand?”United’s faltering form was underlined by having won once in six league matches, drawing during that sequence with struggling Southampton and Crystal Palace. His final season was also characterised by regular public criticism of his players and a fallout with Paul Pogba.United said a statement: “The club would like to thank José for his work during his time at Manchester United and to wish him success in the future. A new caretaker manager will be appointed until the end of the current season, while the club conducts a thorough recruitment process. for a new, full-time manager.”In two full seasons at Old Trafford, Mourinho won the Europa League and League Cup before finishing second in the Premier League last season and reaching the FA Cup final, where United lost 1-0 to Chelsea. In the period since replacing Louis van Gaal, United’s spending stands at £364.3m on eight buys."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74fc77aad879c92d722742b94efa8617ba0f4f10/401_0_2900_1740/master/2900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25e30a972de41a5253f9d682d3023b9f","title":"leicester city manchester city carabao cup quarter final match report","story":"History repeated itself in the East Midlands as Manchester City sealed their passage into the Carabao Cup semi-finals via penalties and at the expense of Leicester for the second season running. Arijanet Muric, City’s 20-year-old Kosovan goalkeeper, was the hero, denying James Maddison and Caglar Soyuncu in a shootout that was not exactly a masterclass in the art of how to take a penalty.Christian Fuchs blazed his kick over the bar, Raheem Sterling fluffed his lines when attempting a Panenka and, without wishing to take too much credit away from Muric, both the penalties he saved were desperately poor.Maddison hesitated during his run-up and then rolled the ball almost in slow motion towards the corner. Soyuncu also stuttered before striking the ball and it was hard to escape the feeling they telegraphed their intentions as a result.Oleksandr Zinchenko was much more ruthless and emphatically dispatched his penalty, leaving Leicester nursing a familiar and frustrating sense of deja vu.Although Claude Puel defended his players when quizzed not only about the quality of their penalties but also that three of the four were defenders, the bottom line is that this was another missed opportunity for Leicester.Pep Guardiola, in contrast, could reflect on a satisfying outcome and also take encouragement from several inidual displays. Kevin De Bryune marked his first start since the beginning of November with a fine goal, his first for City in eight months. Eric García, a 17-year-old Spaniard, played with great maturity at the heart of the defence on his full debut – “an incredible performance” Guardiola said – and then there was Muric’s contribution in goal. “Aro is so big, his reaction is so quick and he took the right decisions. He deserved the big applause.”With Puel and Guardiola making seven and eight changes respectively to their starting lineups, it was perhaps not surprising that the game felt a little flat. De Bruyne’s inclusion was a boost for City after all his injury problems, however, and it was a lovely goal he scored after 14 minutes. After bamboozling Hamza Choudhury with some dexterous footwork, the Belgian whipped a right-foot 20-yard shot, with very little backlift, inside Danny Ward’s near post.“Great news,” said Guardiola, when asked about De Bruyne’s return. “He played at a high level.”De Bruyne departed after 71 minutes and Leicester equalised moments later. Wilfred Ndidi’s crossfield pass exposed Zinchenko’s poor positioning and Marc Albrighton, who had not long come off the bench, cushioned the ball with a lovely first touch before arrowing a terrific shot into the far corner.Puel celebrated wildly on the touchline but everything unravelled for the Leicester manager come the shootout. “We cannot have a debate about the penalties,” he said. “My players took responsibility.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d11cde6d03ab8aa83a97e0cc8ef20e5ab1ab20f7/0_77_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=557d73f6cb2852984ff8d552277f4533","title":"football transfer rumours arsenal chelsea 54m cengiz under","story":"As nothing especially surprising or notable happened yesterday, it falls to the Mill – the noble, brave saviour that is the Mill – to rescue this whole content operation and bring some big numbers to the party. What would they do without us?It sounds like both Arsenal and Chelsea could be removing their blazers and setting their pocket watches to one side in order to grapple for Roma’s Cengiz Under, who will set one of them back £54m.Should the young Turk choose Stamford Bridge, he probably won’t be teeing up chances for Álvaro Morata to meekly dribble into the keeper’s arms. Po’ old Álvaro, his confidence shot to pieces and looking like a broken man, wants out. Specifically in the direction of Milan, who would take him in, put a blanket round his shoulders and give him a hot chocolate.Meanwhile, it seems that Arsenal are keen on the Real Madrid string-puller Isco, which is strange since they already have an in-form creative No 10 who cut his teeth at the Bernabéu, who is always in the team and everyone is absolutely delighted with. Hang on, let’s just double-check that and take a look at their past few team sheets and … oh. Oh Mesut. Anyway, the bad news for Unai Emery and the Gooners is that Manchester City are still keen on bringing Isco to their gaff, as they seemingly have been for years. Chelsea are interested too, so an undignified scrap may ensue. Excellent.We know two things for sure about Adrien Rabiot: one, he has the sort of hair that David Luiz would sport if he had an office job, and two, he seems to have been arguing with PSG about various things ever since he rocked up there, most notably his contract, which expires next summer. That is all culminating in his inevitable departure, but to where? Barcelona are keen (and some reports say they already have a deal in place with the midfielder) as are Liverpool, but they won’t be getting him on a free if PSG have anything to say about it: they want to sell him in January.Crystal Palace are sans striker. They have no striker. They are a striker-free zone. January is the time to remedy that, and it says here that they’re keen on a loan deal for Dominic Solanke, who now finds himself behind Divock Origi in the Liverpool pecking order. Wolves could be taking their stockpiling of Portuguese players to parodical levels by signing the former Real Madrid man Pepe, who left Besiktas recently. Next up, João Pinto, Paulo Futre and José Pereira, goalkeeper in the 1966 World Cup.A couple of other bits to finish off: Everton want shot of Oumar Niasse, who is apparently still there Southampton are keen on the Fulham keeper Marcus Bettinelli and on the goalie tip, Leeds are looking at making a move for Newcastle’s Karl Darlow.Right, think that’s it. Just one final check and … oh … oh good lord. Manchester United did what? They sacked who? They want which former club hero to take over in an interim capacity before moving for which highly coveted Tottenham manager in the summer?

However, Mourinho in China would make for thrilling viewing. Guangzhou Evergrande failed to make it eight out of eight league titles this year and Fabio Cannavaro has not been able to convince everyone at the club. Mourinho has the stature to follow Marcello Lippi and Luiz Felipe Scolari at Guangzhou and the club have the money and ambition to be interested. Fans and media would love his combative style, something that has not been seen in Asia before, although few think he would come so far east. John DuerdenIt would be a major surprise were Mourinho to get another job in England. For one thing he might not want to – Manchester United seemed to be the only available position he felt like taking on after Chelsea – but more importantly after costly failure at Old Trafford there will be few major clubs willing to take the risk. It is important to remember Mourinho was far from an automatic choice at United: there were plenty of influential voices with reservations and after two choppy campaigns gave way to the anticipated third-season syndrome the doubters will consider themselves vindicated. It is possibly too soon to write Mourinho off, he could easily turn up somewhere and make the best of a fresh start and a clean slate, though in England the clean slate will always be a problem. Let’s face it, the man has not looked happy in his workplace for several years now. Paul WilsonUnless Marseille, with their size, history and fanbase, receive heavy investment in the near future, the only potentially viable Ligue 1 destination for Mourinho is Paris Saint-Germain. QSI have often courted Mourinho since acquiring the club and he told Téléfoot in 2014 he was PSG’s first choice over Carlo Ancelotti in 2011 before rejecting further Parisian advances when with Real Madrid. Although Mourinho remains highly rated by the PSG hierarchy and despite flirtations last season when Mourinho referred to PSG’s talent as special and magic, their interest has cooled a little of late. Not least owing to an admiration of Thomas Tuchel’s slow yet effective evolution of the club. Even if Tuchel’s reign were to deteriorate, it is likely Mourinho would have to wait until summer 2020 for a vacancy to appear, given the capital already accrued by the German. As for the French national team, the FFF will stick with the “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” adage for the foreseeable future. They are world champions after all. Adam WhiteSuggestions Mourinho’s free-agent status could have come at a handy time for Bayern Munich have not been slow to arrive in the conversation. Bayern are adrift of the Bundesliga leaders, Borussia Dortmund, and with not only the manager, Niko Kovac, but major powerbrokers Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge under some pressure. In terms of personality and profile Mourinho clearly ticks a few boxes and Bayern’s squad is stacked with the type of senior players he prefers working with. Ideologically, however, it is not much of a fit. Mourinho’s brand of football would be a tough sell to Hoeness and Rummenigge (not to mention the Allianz Arena public) at the best of times, let alone on his current run and with the team needing a jump-start. He probably would not find a transfer budget to his liking, with the €43.5m spent on Corentin Tolisso from Lyon in 2017 still a club record, and the feeling is Bayern want to go bold and fresh next summer. Andy BrassellThe most obvious landing spot for Mourinho in Italy would be with Inter: the team he led to the treble in 2010. Luciano Spalletti signed a new contract with the club at the start of this season but his failure to make it through to the Champions League knockout stage or mount a credible title challenge could provide a pretext for change. The Nerazzurri recently hired the former Juventus CEO Beppe Marotta to shape their sporting strategy and he might also want to put his imprint on the club by naming the next manager. Juventus themselves are happy with Massimiliano Allegri and would be unlikely to consider Mourinho in any case given the bad blood between them. Roma or Milan could conceivably have vacancies before the end of this season, but Mourinho might not be a popular choice with fans even if those clubs could find the resources to afford him. Paolo Bandini There are only two clubs who could realistically afford Mourinho: Zenit St Petersburg and Spartak Moscow. But the Gazprom-owned Zenit have got a new manager, the fans’ favourite Sergey Semak, who was appointed before the start of the season and Spartak sacked Massimo Carrera to appoint Oleg Kononov last month. So it does not feel plausible to suggest that one of them would even consider talking to Mourinho at this stage.The other factor to take in is that the quality of the Russian league is not improving and not a single club has reached the knockout stage of the Champions League for the past three years. Perhaps Mourinho would think the Russian league is not good enough for him.As for the national team, Russia have just reached the World Cup quarter-finals and the Russian FA has obviously no plans to replace Stanislav Cherchesov, who costs them way less than Mourinho would, and who has already proved he can get a result with a team that cannot be described as one of the best in Russia’s history. Artur PetrosyanMourinho’s sacking will have caused a flash of emotion, a touch of excitement in Madrid. On the Real Madrid board there are still directors, the president included, who harbour the hope of bringing him back one day. In moments of clarity, there is a recognition that to do so carries risks that are not advisable to take but there is a touch of forbidden fruit about him, the unrealisable dream.His name never entirely leaves their thoughts. His departure was bitter and unpleasant his relationship with some in the dressing room broken. Sergio Ramos, the Real captain, would not welcome him back. And yet that is one of the reasons why Florentino Pérez finds the idea attractive: a part of him feels the tug of a purge. Another part wonders if it is really worth it.Not least because of the social impact, the possibility of reopening a ide. Fans too are concerned at the consequences of a return: some fear his arrival, others are repelled by the idea. Yet there are others, a hard core, who would be delighted by it. Whether Mourinho would be is another matter. And if it is not Real, it cannot truly be anyone in Spain.

The amount women earn and the way they spend it is still a taboo subjectAt the beginning of this year, I became one of the many women who have published their money diaries on the internet. I was asked by my editor to record my spending for four weeks over Christmas, to test my assumption that I would not be able to afford to buy a house in London by simply cutting back on day-to-day extravagances such as takeaway coffees. On learning my salary, the personal finance expert Martin Lewis agreed that this was the case when he saw a day-by-day breakdown of where my money was going, he changed his tune.Lewis told me that I could save enough for a deposit – yes, in London yes, by myself. But first I would have to rein in my senseless spending. I concluded the story a bit shamefaced by his gentle admonishment and resolved to do better. Then my diary was published.The response was immediate and visceral I have never experienced anything like it. In a very long, typewritten letter, a reader told me my fecklessness brought shame on my parents and my editor and warned that, if not addressed, it would cause tension with my future husband and our hypothetical children, culminating, potentially, in my alcoholism. “I have not written this in anger,” she concluded, “but out of serious concern for the way you are wasting your money and your life.”Some people saw their spending reflected in mine, they told me privately. Many more were publicly critical of my £181 haircut (too much), my £1 sausage roll (way too little), and for losing a £20 note on a night out (which I wasn’t thrilled about either). It was later raised in a keynote address on financial education at the University of Edinburgh beneath the heading: “Entitled, spoilt and ridiculous or just youthful play?”Would I have shared so freely had I known what was to come? Maybe not. I had no idea that my personal finance could be taken so personally by so many people. In that regard, I was colossally naive.Money diaries are reliably incendiary on social media – hence their popularity. The , the , Ireland’s TheJournal.ie, Man Repeller and many others regularly publish them, but the site most responsible for popularising them is Refinery29. The lifestyle site now publishes anonymous diaries daily in the US and weekly in the UK, overwhelmingly written by and read by women.Lindsey Stanberry, Refinery29’s work and money director and the editor of the series, says its aim is to give women a space in which to share their experiences and knowledge of personal finance when the social stigma against it perpetuates their financial disadvantage.“Money is still taboo,” she says. “One of the reasons that the wage gap has lingered so long is because women have always been discouraged from talking about it, therefore we lack basic knowledge. Having these conversations isn’t easy, but there’s literal payoff.”It is not just the case that women are systematically paid less than men: they are also less likely to ask for a raise or to invest their savings, and are at greater risk of being impoverished by separation or orce. The Billfold – another US site aimed at women and set on breaking “one of the last taboos in our culture: talking about what you earn” – powerfully set out the stakes in A Story of a Fuck Off Fund, published in January 2016, showing how having savings put away can be the difference between having no choice but to stay in an abusive workplace or relationship and being free to leave.With more to gain from free and frank discussion of personal finance, it is not surprising that women write the majority of money diaries. The catch is, for as long as the taboo exists, they may suffer a personal cost for doing so – especially when a diary goes viral. One published in Grazia last month, about a woman earning £40,000 a year and still receiving cash from her parents, received widespread coverage beneath headlines such as “BANK OF DAD: Woman, 30, slammed as a sponger”, alongside choice quotes of critical online reaction.It is not only diarists deemed by the internet to be irresponsible with money who go viral. Last month, a 22-year-old woman earning $25,000 (£19,700) a month from e-commerce was held up as “your brunch hate read of the day” and “cluelessly braggy” for saving the majority of her earnings each month. Refinery29 also came under fire for showcasing such a wealthy woman, although its own analysis had previously found that while readers request diaries of women with lower salaries, those featuring higher salaries get more clicks.“You have to be a near-perfect human” to escape criticism of your money diary, Stanberry wrote in her address to “all the haters”: “When are women allowed to celebrate their wealth? Is it sexist the way we criticise women for their spending habits? Or when they accept help from family?”In my case, some readers were angry that I was put forward to answer the question: “Can one millennial afford to buy a house?” when I was not representative of my generation, earning considerably more than the median annual salary of £28,677 (although my salary is about in line for London).Regardless of the outcome, they said, the exercise fuelled false narratives that home ownership was purely a question of personal restraint in the same way that those “success stories” profiling young homeowners always play down the deposit gifted by their parents.Which is fair enough. Indeed, nearly a year on, I am more sceptical of Lewis’s final assessment that I could afford a house in London on my own. I had begun the diary exercise knowing that I was not prepared to make home ownership the primary goal of the rest of my 20s and much of my 30s. Nothing Lewis said changed that.Many more readers, however, took umbrage with the cost of my haircut separate to any question of its alleged link to the housing crisis, despite it being one of only two I had all year, and costing far less than, say, a football season ticket or a new iPhone – both purchases that would be wasted on me, which others find to be worth every penny.“Life is just more expensive for women,” says my friend Katie, 29. “We can’t wear the same cheap T-shirt and pair of jeans every day for five years and still be treated with respect.” As the self-described “nosiest person in the world about money”, she is a voracious reader of online money diaries, and has published her own, anonymously.Katie lists, with exasperation, clothes, makeup, skincare and beauty treatments – all to some extent necessary for women to be judged equally presentable and competent as a man. Being transparent about those costs makes painfully clear the double standard, she says. “It is a political act to talk openly about money and everyone should do it and be challenged to do it.”Katie is Australian. In hindsight, I connect the breeziness with which I approached publishing my finances to the fact that I spent more than half my life living there and in New Zealand, where there is less of a social stigma against talking about money than there is in the UK. My female friends and I have regular, frank conversations about our own spending, saving and earning, going back years to the starts of our careers, on the understanding that the knowledge empowers us all.With many of them having successfully negotiated salary increases, it has even brought material benefit. But it is testament to our complex, personal relationship with personal finance that even people who are in favour of transparency, in principle, can find themselves going “all cannibalistic” when faced with it, says Devin Friedman, the editor of the online Wealthsimple Magazine, based in Toronto, Canada.Its Money Diaries series made waves online in the US last month with an American couple’s anonymous, personal account of how they came to be an estimated $360,000 in debt. “A lot of people were really angry about it,” says Friedman. “Like: ‘You’re sending your kids to private school, you’re buying sushi, and you’re complaining that you’re in debt?’” The couple declined to be interviewed for this piece.Friedman points to studies (such as this one) that show money only makes people happier if it improves their social rank to emphasise that it is not a strictly logical matter. “Money has bundled into it such emotional power: resentment, inadequacy, fear, the desire to impress. Sometimes reading about people with privilege acting like they’re not privileged can inspire people to get pissed off.”But everyone is better off understanding money better, Friedman says, whether on a practical level or a human one. “It’s anecdotal evidence, but I think women have made more of a point of being transparent than men have. For men, the social imperative isn’t there.” Friedman says the comedian Maria Bamford and the co-creator of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Rachel Bloom, felt it was important to give specifics about their income in their interviews for Wealthsimple.So, in the spirit of gender equality, nearly a year since my money diary was published, am I any closer to home ownership?Absolutely – in the same way that if I take a step south-east, I am closer to Australia. But Lewis’s (very obvious) points that I would need savings sometime, and that I would have more the sooner I started, made a strong impression on me. In 11 months, I have saved six weeks’ salary without going into debt – or even cutting down on coffee. The tradeoff has been bringing in my lunch for four weekdays out of five. I hardly notice the difference.I also use Monzo, the millennial-friendly bank, to keep track of my discretionary income, and the savings app Chip. But really, as Lewis said, the biggest shift I had to make was mental. Once I was convinced of the need to save each month, my spending seemed to contract to accommodate it.The fact that I was able to achieve this without significant impact on my lifestyle is more evidence of what was obvious, first to Lewis, then to my irate correspondents: clearly, I had money to burn. I just had to keep a spending diary to realise it myself. I would recommend the exercise, for anyone lucky enough to be merrily oblivious about where their money is going – but maybe not publishing it on the internet. At least, not beneath your name and your email address.• This article was amended on 19 December 2018 to correct the name of the TV show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4249e06744e387c92b7c3627a5c60be0c79de6d/217_54_2292_1376/master/2292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccaa336e5777649bf185ddd1788cbe3d","title":"kylie minogue glastonbury 2019 legend slot","story":"It will be the singer’s first full set at the festival, after she had to cancel a headlining performance in 2005 to undergo cancer treatmentKylie Minogue will perform the Sunday teatime “legend” slot at Glastonbury festival 2019.The heritage act slot on the festival’s main Pyramid stage tends to draw the biggest crowd of the weekend, and has been filled in recent years by Barry Gibb, Lionel Richie and Dolly Parton.

She was the Grammy-nominated Prince protege who cloaked her experimental R\u0026ampB in layers of Afrofuturist myth under an android alter ego, Cindi Mayweather. She was famed for her live shows. But who was she, really? This was the year Monáe answered that question, stripping away her mythos on Dirty Computer, a searing concept album that drew comparisons with Beyoncé’s Lemonade and Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly. It was a unique coming-out record by a black, queer woman and a state-of-the-nation treatise on American identity in 2018.A day prior to its release, Monáe came out as pansexual in Rolling Stone, dedicating her new record to anyone who felt “ostracised” or “bullied”. As such, there’s a vital message of self-acceptance at the core of Dirty Computer. Sometimes this comes veiled in Prince-like synths and ribald lyrics about trysts on shag carpets (Make Me Feel). At others – such as on Pynk, featuring Grimes and sampling Aerosmith – it comes in the form of intimate whispers about “the lips around your … maybe” that give way to an indomitable groove. Cindi Mayweather is not entirely forgotten, however. On the punning Take a Byte, Monáe infuses her sci-fi canon with queerness, dismissing the confines of robotics she had set out on previous albums The ArchAndroid and The Electric Lady: “Your code is programmed not to love me, but you can’t pretend,” she coos.It’s also a record about womanhood, and black womanhood in particular. “Remember when they used to say I look too mannish?” Monáe asks on Django Jane, a song that celebrates “black girl magic”, while also acknowledging that she has been treated as less-than in a Eurocentric industry. Having starred in two acclaimed, black-led films (Moonlight and Hidden Figures), and been a vocal proponent of the Black Lives Matter movement, this was not new territory for Monáe, but it was more overt than ever in her music. See also Crazy, Classic, Life, which opens with a Martin Luther King-style speech and closes with a rap about inequality and wanting to “break the rules like you”: to be considered on a par with white society.On the hedonistic Screwed, she further widens her view to take in the contradictions of post-#MeToo sexuality. It’s an ode to sexual liberation and a takedown of men “telling me cover up my areolas  while they blocking equal pay, sippin’ on they Coca Colas”. The song’s standout line – “everything is sex, ’cept sex which is power” – may have been cribbed from Oscar Wilde, but in the current US political climate it takes on new significance.Monáe explained her former love of artifice in the Rolling Stone interview, revealing that she had created an alter ego so she “didn’t have to talk about the Janelle Monáe who was in therapy”.In letting it go, she has created her best work yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36b0dcf58cce8b4a2c8ba99b4ce540310636169/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3da0d0f6f38297a97172c4ae72945a6d","title":"2018 a terrible year for facebook podcast","story":"Facebook has been hit by a series of data, privacy and hate speech scandals this year.

Ministers acknowledged the steps that had already been taken, No 10 said, including 320 “no-deal workstreams” across all departments and 106 no-deal technical notices.“Cabinet agreed that with just over three months from our exit from the EU, we have now reached the point where we need to ramp up these preparations. This means we will now set in motion the remaining elements of our no-deal plans. Cabinet also agreed to recommend businesses ensure they are similarly prepared enacting their own no-deal plans.”Downing Street suggested preparations could include reserving space on ferries in order to ensure a supply of food and medicines.Speaking later in the Commons, the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, said his department “will have 3,500 service personnel held at readiness, including regulars and reserves, in order to support any government department on any contingencies they may need”.Citizens will be informed how to prepare through a “range of channels” that could include TV adverts and social media. Ministers agreed to allocate money from a £2bn contingency fund to departments such as the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.HMRC will prepare a 100-page pack for all UK businesses on preparing for no-deal, and will send out about 80,000 emails to businesses.During the meeting, the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, told her colleagues preparing for a no-deal Brexit was a sensible precaution but “just because you put a seatbelt on doesn’t mean you should crash the car”.The justice secretary, David Gauke, who said publicly at the weekend he would resign rather than be part of a government that deliberately pursued no-deal, told the meeting that a “managed no-deal is not a viable option”.“It’s not on offer from the EU and the responsibility of cabinet ministers is not to propagate unicorns but to slay them,” he said, according to a cabinet source.A “managed no-deal” is the approach favoured by Brexit-backing ministers including Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom, who believe the government could pay part of the £39bn the government has agreed it owes the EU to “purchase” a status quo transition period.Downing Street said delivering the prime minister’s deal “remains the top priority”, but when presented with three options on whether to increase, maintain or wind down preparations, there was unanimity in cabinet to implement all no-deal contingency planning across departments. All agreed that they would implement contingencies across Whitehall. Previously, departments had been given some freedom to decide when and what they spent on no-deal planning.The environment secretary, Michael Gove, is among those who have been allocating the most resources, recently advertising for 90 staff for an EU exit crisis centre to respond to emergencies following a no-deal Brexit.Defra, along with the Home Office and the Department for International Trade, are to get the most significant budgets for no-deal preparations.Several ministers pushed for no-deal to become Whitehall’s “central planning assumption”, but Downing Street said its position remained that a deal was the most likely outcome.Speaking after the meeting, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said the default option was for the UK to leave without any exit arrangement in place unless MPs backed the deal.“Parliament needs to back the deal because the consequence of not doing so is we risk the default of no-deal and a responsible government must prepare for that eventuality,” he said. “That is what we agreed at cabinet. That is what we are going to do.”The issues around no-deal planning were not solely financial but also related to decisions over whether to take civil servants off important domestic priorities, one cabinet minister said. “Do you take civil servants off the social care green paper, for example? That’s the choices in front of us,” the minister said.The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, said on Tuesday it was “right and proper” for no-deal planning to be stepped up.“We have been taking no-deal seriously for some considerable period,” he said. “I’m not going to pretend otherwise that we are stepping up our preparations for no-deal. Although, frankly the way to avoid that, as I’m sure others would say very clearly, is having parliament voting to secure that deal.”May is trying to persuade rebellious Tory MPs that the alternatives to her Brexit deal are worse than the deal, before the meaningful vote in the week of 14 January.Leave-supporting ministers emerged cheered from the meeting, because the idea of holding a series of indicative votes on Brexit, which has been gaining ground in recent days, was firmly rejected by the prime minister, who is determined to bring her deal back in January.Mordaunt told the meeting she objected to the indicative votes idea because it was a way to “gerrymander” an outcome."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35779ca90585bd33323644930ddae4ea1bd0102a/0_0_2146_1288/master/2146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75067ad9a15d0ba320fe87c04bfbf94d","title":"business watching in horror as pm plans for no deal brexit","story":"Five leading organisations say UK is not ready and parliament must back Theresa May’s deal British business has issued a stark warning to MPs that they risk plunging an ill-prepared economy into chaos unless they stop playing politics at Westminster and back the prime minister’s Brexit deal.As ministers agreed to a dramatic escalation of preparations for a no-deal Brexit, including putting 3,500 armed forces personnel on standby, the leaders of the UK’s five leading employers’ groups said the country was nowhere near ready.With Theresa May’s deal not due to be voted on until mid-January, and significant resistance among her own MPs, a three-hour cabinet meeting on Tuesday concluded with a decision to “ramp up” no-deal readiness.The Treasury is allocating an extra £2bn to 25 Whitehall departments for the next financial year to get ready for Brexit – including a no-deal scenario.Planned measures include hiring an extra 3,000 customer service and compliance staff in HM Revenue and recruiting hundreds of border officers.The prime minister’s spokesman said: “Cabinet agreed that with just over three months from our exit from the EU, we have now reached the point where we need to ramp up these preparations. This means we will now set in motion the remaining elements of our no-deal plans.”The five business organisations – the CBI, Institute of Directors, British Chambers of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and the manufacturing body EEF – said they were horrified by the infighting at Westminster that has seen a meaningful vote on the prime minister’s plan delayed until the middle of next month.Their statement will strengthen Downing Street’s case that MPs must accept the prime minister’s deal in the new year or face potential economic chaos.“The responsibility to find a way forward now rests directly with 650 MPs in parliament,” the business groups’ statement said. “Nobody wants to prolong the uncertainty, but everyone must remember that businesses and communities need time to adapt to future changes.“As the UK’s leading business groups, we are asking MPs from all parties to return to their constituencies over Christmas and talk to their local business communities. We hope that they will listen and remember that when they return to parliament, the future course of our economy will be in their hands.”They said many companies had yet to make any preparations for what has until recently been seen as a remote possibility, and that it was far too late to start.“Businesses have been watching in horror as politicians have focused on factional disputes rather than practical steps that business needs to move forward. The lack of progress in Westminster means that the risk of a no-deal Brexit is rising,” they said.Businesses of all sizes are reaching the point of no return, with many now putting in place contingency plans that are a significant drain on time and money. Firms are pausing or erting investment into stockpiling goods or materials, erting cross-border trade and moving offices and factories out of the UK. However, Westminster’s bitter factional ide showed no signs of closing on Tuesday night as the SNP and other minor opposition parties tabled a vote of no confidence in the government. The parties criticised Jeremy Corbyn for his failure to demand a full no-confidence motion in the government, with SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accusing the Labour leader of being happy to let Theresa May use delaying tactics to avoid a vote on her deal. “This is not acceptable and people deserve better,” he said.Announcing the outcome of Tuesday’s cabinet meeting, May’s spokesman said ministers “agreed that delivering the deal that the prime minister agreed with Brussels remains the government’s top priority and our best no-deal mitigation”. But he added it was the government’s “continued duty to prepare for every eventuality, including a no-deal situation”.During the marathon meeting, the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, told her colleagues that preparing for a no-deal Brexit was a sensible precaution but “just because you put a seatbelt on doesn’t mean you should crash the car”.David Gauke, the justice secretary, who said publicly at the weekend he would resign rather than be part of a government that deliberately pursued no-deal, told the meeting that a “managed no-deal is not a viable option”.“It’s not on offer from the EU and the responsibility of cabinet ministers is not to propagate unicorns but to slay them,” he said, according to a cabinet source.A “managed no-deal” is the approach favoured by ministers including Penny Mordaunt and Andrea Leadsom, who believe the government could pay part of the £39bn it has agreed it owes the EU to “purchase” a status quo transition period.The former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab wrote in the  that leaving on World Trade Organization terms would be better than “being trapped in a lousy deal” and suggested using the £39bn set aside for the EU orce bill to offer tax cuts to businesses to help with the transition.The former Tory minister Nick Boles responded to Tuesday’s no-deal news from the cabinet by saying he would immediately resign the Conservative whip if it was adopted as government policy – and if necessary, vote with opposition parties to prevent it from happening.The business leaders said the lack of progress at Westminster meant the government had no choice but to step up no-deal planning. “But it is clear there is simply not enough time to prevent severe dislocation and disruption in just 100 days. This is not where we should be,” they said.The statement was signed by Adam Marshall, the director general of the BCC Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of the EEF Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the FSB and Stephen Martin, the director general of the IOD.Downing Street said delivering the prime minister’s deal “remains the top priority”, but when presented with three options on whether to increase, maintain or wind down preparations, there was unanimity in the cabinet to implement all no-deal contingency planning across departments. The public will be advised what contingency measures to take, through a “range of channels” that could include TV adverts and social media.HMRC will prepare a 100-page pack for all UK businesses on preparing for no-deal and will send out about 80,000 emails to them.May will meet the leaders of the devolved administrations in Downing Street on Wednesday in her latest attempt to build support for her deal.She said: “It is more important than ever that the devolved administrations get behind this deal and listen to businesses and industry bodies across all four nations who have been clear that it provides the certainty they need.”Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is implacably opposed to Brexit, but May said: “Now is the time for us to pull together and harness our efforts behind this deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43aedeb62483d363b7b68d2bc788010c282f1c15/0_229_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f65355a2217fda4f5379646f572d156b","title":"this is supposed to be a rich country volunteers on the reality of food bank britain","story":"Food charities are preparing for their busiest Christmas ever.  readers and volunteers share stories from the frontline of povertyMy husband’s work arranged a food bank collection, as part of their corporate social responsibility. I rang up the organiser and said: “I can come, but I’ll have to bring my baby.” He was eight months old and used to sit in a high chair. We get a lot of young mothers who are embarrassed to be there having a baby at the table immediately makes a connection. Straight away, you are talking about sleep, or lack of.Before I started, I thought I was socially aware. Actually, I had no clue. I was living in my own little bubble. My boys come home from school. “Can I get a snack?” “Of course you can.” It has been a massive eye-opener.Quite a few asylum-seeking families who come to our food bank had babies of the same age. The bittersweet thing is they are still coming, so we see their babies grow up. The mums remember my little boy. He will turn three in May.I see lots of single gentlemen in their 60s, who have lived in Sheffield their entire lives, had a health condition and can no longer work. They say: “It’s all fine.” Then you will hear the voice crack and the tears start. They say: “I’m sorry, I tried not to come.” At first I used to come out and cry. Now, it’s more like anger. Things aren’t getting better for these people, our guests. I talk to my boys about it. I hope that, by talking, the next generation will think differently.I worked in engineering all my life. My last firm, where I was manager, closed down. It was winter and it was so boring at home. One day, I went to the supermarket and they were collecting for Sufra. I asked if they could give me a volunteering job.It was so interesting to meet new people. If you help, you feel good. I thought: I’ll carry on here. It’s the opposite of engineering, isn’t it? There, you are working with machines, delivering stuff, forklifts, supplying car parts to other engineering companies. I work five days a week it’s nearly a full-time job. It keeps me out of trouble and I get exercise. My father used to do the same thing in Uganda. He used to help local people who were in trouble with food.There was one guy who asked for food. After he had his soup, he said: “I feel like a king.” It made me very happy. We tell people: “This is your right. You need it, so take it. Don’t feel embarrassed.” Anybody who walks in and says they want to eat, we give to them. Nobody goes hungry here.It was my partner, Liberty, who inspired me. When she became very poorly a few years back with lupus, she found herself having to use the food bank to get by.Last year, she started to volunteer. I’m a scriptwriter and she said: “You’re spending so much time in the library. Why don’t you come and help?” My instinct was: that’s not for me. I’ve never done much charity work. I wasn’t sure what it would involve. But it’s quite something working down there. It really gives you a focus. Everyone digs in and does their best. It’s pretty heart-wrenching at times. You have to bite your lip and offer support. I’m not as good at that as the more experienced people.Some people moan about the quality of the food. The biggest problem is that, because you can’t do fresh stuff, the quality isn’t great. Liberty is trying to get people to donate dried herbs and spices so they can be added to stews. But please, no tins of beans. We’ve got cupboards of them.For my MA, I researched food insecurity. I had no intention, when I came to the UK from California, to focus on that. But I read a lot of articles about food banks.After my degree, I felt compelled to do something. On my first day, I sat with the food bank users while they waited for their parcels. People can request items – whether they prefer tea or coffee, are vegetarian or don’t have a stove. If you are in food poverty, you still have preferences.I’ve been surprised by how open people are. Even if their stories are sad, it makes me feel more connected. When I talk to immigrants, it makes me conscious of the fact that, because of my visa, I am not eligible for benefits, either. I, too, would have to rely on my community. It’s only recently that I’ve felt London is the place I call home.I didn’t plan to set up the Hygiene Bank. In August, I sent a WhatsApp to some friends saying I was collecting toiletries for food banks. They shared it. I started getting messages saying: “I hear you’re collecting …” My partner has a shoe shop in Sevenoaks, Kent, so people dropped donations in. Then they said: “Have you got anywhere apart from the shoe shop? Have you got anywhere apart from Sevenoaks?” Four months on, we have 65 projects nationally and have provided 6.3 tonnes of essential toiletries.On my first visit to a food bank, a woman walked in with two children in school uniform and said: ‘Ooh, shall we get a toothbrush?!’ For these things to be considered treats was unfathomable to me, but they can change the world for one person. Who can present their best self if they aren’t feeling good? It’s isolating, humiliating. These are the words I hear all the time. If we can remove this one symptom of poverty – hygiene poverty – people can integrate. They can go to school, go to that interview.I met a woman who was living in a hostel with two children, getting food from a food bank. She had been married, had a home. Then her husband died unexpectedly – as did mine, seven years ago. Everything collapsed in my life, but my finances didn’t. I thought: “Imagine trying to deal with that on top of the grief.” I was left comfortable, which means I have time to do this. Part of me thinks my whole life has led me to this.When the food bank started, my husband and I were invited to the opening. This is supposed to be a rich country. But I feel blessed to be able to help. I make sure the area is nice for the clients. You don’t rush, you let them take their time. I give them a hug. Some are crying. You say hello, introduce yourself, offer a drink. We say: have a look in the bag. If there is an item you don’t like, we will try to swap it.You have to be ever so careful. We’re giving them pasta, but can they cook it? They might not have the money for electricity or gas. Maybe one of the group might bring along bread. A loaf of bread is a special thing. You haven’t got to cook it. You can just eat.I volunteer with Penny Appeal, which organises biryanis for the food bank. We distribute about 150 of them. They are almost always gone.I try to make sure we’re being joyful and put a smile on someone else’s face. You don’t talk to them like “a homeless person”, you just talk to them like a person. Sometimes I see people I’ve grown up with, gone to school with, and think how quickly life can change.The church that organises it gives a little talk before they distribute the food. A little prayer in Jesus’s name. Faith is a part of it. Being a Muslim, I’ve got nothing against this we follow Jesus as well as Muhammad.My wife is from India. She came over here two years ago and had this image of England as having no poverty. When I expose her to stuff like this, it helps her to understand. You can’t do as much as you want to do, but even a small action gives back to a community. Spiritually, it helps me, it strengthens me.I retired after 40 years in the NHS, working as a midwife with drug users and people who experienced deprivation. I could see the effects of not having money, not having a break in life.A number of people I worked with during their pregnancy come to the food bank, so I get quite a lot of cuddles. Some of the babies are mums themselves now. The way I think is: if you can do something to help, why wouldn’t you?Kirkcaldy is an area of high unemployment. There are a lot of second- and third-generation unemployed families. Last month, we issued nearly 1,000 food parcels. The public in Kirkcaldy is so generous.Anything that is a bit different is appreciated. People are so grateful for jam. Just now, we are getting packets of shortbread. It’s humbling to be able to make somebody’s day that wee bit better.We call it a food pantry the difference between us and a food bank is that we charge a fee of £3. There was a lot of consultation with single parents and people who are these days referred to as “the working poor” (which is not a phrase I like). We charge so that people feel they can maintain their dignity.The pantry is based on the Great Thornton estate. It’s like a shop. We’ve got fresh items – leeks, mangoes, onions, tangerines. We’ve got ambient food, tinned food, frozen food. We’ve got people making friends. When we get to know attendees, we can dig a bit deeper, find out what the issues are and hopefully develop a wraparound project. Every few months, we have cooking demonstrations.We’ve got about 170 members. We get new ones every week, which to my mind is very alarming, given the increasing numbers of millionaires. Many years ago, I worked for a private business and the boss was a millionaire. I worked my backside off for peanuts. I was 29 when I went to university to study social work. It just sits with my values. I enjoy my work immensely, but I’ve never seen it as bad as this in terms of the rank poverty.This is an affluent area. I’m from the north and the first thing I noticed was all the BMWs and Audis here.The senior school has what they call a links worker. One pupil had turned up at school and he hadn’t showered because he had no running hot water. The links worker knew I was attached to a church and asked if we could help, so we did a hamper for the family. Then I emailed the council to say that it was appalling that a mum was living in those conditions. Eventually, they got social housing.A friend of mine and I were talking about it and we decided to start a food bank in Wallingford. That was eight years ago – she’s now our manager.I grew up near Halifax in a very poor home. My dad liked his drink. We didn’t eat. The three eldest worked, so they got fed. But the three youngest didn’t. Mum would send us to the shop to get food on credit. I’m not complaining. I’ve seen a lot of life. But I never expected in the 21st century that I would be working in a food bank."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84f526f206e5c8224518fc72c12d0be33c584847/0_3_4878_2928/master/4878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ab00ae1a024d849dafe4ad5e2573021","title":"cricket england sam curran ipl king","story":"Sam Curran emerged as the big winner from the English hopefuls in Tuesday’s Indian Premier League auction, capping his meteoric rise in international cricket with an £800,000 deal to play for Kings XI Punjab.The Surrey all-rounder will be one of five English newcomers in the IPL next year, with Jonny Bairstow signed by Sunrisers Hyderabad for £245,000, Liam Livingstone securing a £55,000 deal at Rajasthan Royals, and Joe Denly (£110,000) and Harry Gurney (£80,000) heading to Kolkata Knightriders.While Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler, Moeen Ali and David Willey had already been retained by their teams, availability was always going to be an issue for others. England’s World Cup players must return to the UK by 24 April for ODIs against Ireland and Pakistan and thus miss the backend of the seven-week IPL that runs to 19 May.Accordingly, Jason Roy, Tom Curran, Adil Rashid, Joe Root and Liam Plunkett did not enter the auction, preferring to start the summer at their counties. Alex Hales and Chris Woakes went unsold, while the names of Eoin Morgan and Mark Wood did not emerge after the shortlist was trimmed down midway through.Sam Curran, who is centrally contracted by England but seemingly not part of their World Cup plans, had no such issue. And despite an unspectacular Twenty20 record – and the auction’s graphics displaying his brother Tom’s picture – his match-winning performances in the summer’s 4-1 Test series win over India prompted a bidding war, with Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Capitals missing out to Kings XI Punjab.“What a year! Couldn’t be more excited to join the @lionsdenkxip at the @IPL in 2019,” the 20-year-old tweeted, having attracted the highest price for an overseas signing in an auction that saw the eight teams add 80 players to their squads.Bairstow’s deal comes after stopping off in Sharjah on the way back from the Sri Lanka tour and smashing a timely 84 off 24 balls in a T10 match. With teams able to retain players for future seasons, Sunrisers have seemingly taken the view that – one of three players to score 1,000-plus ODI runs this year – is a sound long-term investment, even the England opener will play only the first four weeks of next year.Denly twice went unsold in the auction before tempting KKR into a bid. The Kent all-rounder was recently named in England’s ODI squad for the Caribbean but cannot yet be said to have booked his World Cup place.Though Gurney, Nottinghamshire’s former England left-armer, and Livingstone, the Lancashire batsman, picked up relatively minor deals – after tax and various fees, the sums will not be life-changing – the lure of impressing at the IPL is too great.It means missing the first seven weeks of the English summer, which next year includes all but the final of the Royal London One-Day Cup. With the 2020 edition of that competition being played at the same time as the controversial 100-ball tournament, it is a situation that counties will soon have to get used to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd2376a3474d03f962b2252efc7db2659b8c70e5/0_144_2526_1515/master/2526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb7181ddb0882f6dc924cc42b89b2d84","title":"geordan murphy appointed leicester head coach rugby union","story":"• Tigers have lost eight games on the bounce• ‘We are working hard to improve performances and results’Geordan Murphy has been appointed as Leicester’s permanent head coach despite a run of eight straight defeats that has left the Tigers at “their lowest ebb”, according to the former Ireland full-back.Murphy, who has spent 21 years at Leicester as a player and coach, was handed the role on an interim basis when Matt O’Connor was sacked after the first game of the season but has managed four wins from his 15 matches in charge.The Tigers are all but out of Europe after Sunday’s home defeat by Racing 92 and are three points from the bottom of the Premiership, but the Leicester hierarchy is determined to avoid another overhaul, having sacked Richard Cockerill, Aaron Mauger and O’Connor in the past 24 months and finalised the decision to appoint Murphy permanently at Monday’s board meeting.“We’ve had a challenging start to the season and we are working hard to improve performances and results, but this is also the start of a journey for this coaching team and playing group,” said Murphy.Leicester are also closing in on a new defence coach, having conceded 292 points in the Premiership this season – the worst in the league – and a further 121 in Europe. Dave Ellis, who worked with France at the 2011 World Cup, and Mike Ford have been linked to the role. “We are looking at how and what we can add to the coaching team in terms of experience and quality,” Murphy said. “It has to be the right fit for the team.”Leicester’s decline has been evident since 2013 – the last time they reached the Premiership final – while Saracens have replaced them as top dogs in England. The Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, has applauded Leicester’s decision to seek continuity. “One of the mistakes Saracens made in a previous era was to chop and change,” said McCall. “One of things we’ve done better over the last 10 years is to have some continuity. It builds relationships.”Meanwhile, London Irish will play their home games at the new Brentford Community Stadium from 2020. The Championship leaders have reached an agreement with Brentford FC to play at the stadium in west London, which is currently under construction and will have a capacity of 17,250.

All images captured on the Google Pixel 3A decade ago, grabbing a burger was a quick fix, something we did when we were short of cash, time or imagination. For modern diners, going for a burger is a quest. A quest for excellence: gastronomic, ethical and aesthetic excellence. In cities around the globe, dishes that would once have been termed fast food – pizza, grilled cheese sandwiches, tacos and hot dogs – are being taken as an art form, with fiercely loyal cult followings on social media and five-star newspaper reviews by food critics previously accustomed to starchy tablecloths and foamy, fiddly haute cuisine offerings. On Twitter and other social media platforms, diners furiously debate the merits of a Bleecker burger over a Patty \u0026amp Bun burger on the Mexican front, Breddos and DF Mexico vie for the crown of best tacos in London, and the gloves are off between devotees of Pizza Pilgrims and Franco Manca.This is the golden age of flash food – poshed-up fast food – when the most sought-after meals around the UK are sophisticated versions of simple staples.“I think haute cuisine has been put in its place,” says chef Gizzi Erskine, author of Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over. “We now take comfort in simple dishes that mean something to us, that may have been pushed to another level from technique and ingredients. Plus, we care much more about the ingredients – provenance, breed and how things are farmed – so there’s a new understanding that a great piece of meat cooked simply is enough.”A menu is one of the most telling barometers of any society, indicating our shifting aspirations, economic circumstances, ethical and health preoccupations and how we choose to socialise. “This is definitely a sociological trend as much as about food tastes,” says Damien Gabet, editor of Square Meal magazine. “It’s no longer cool to shout about that Michelin-starred meal you ate off starched tablecloths, but there’s cultural capital to be gained from going out and Instagramming a meal from the most hyped food truck in town.”Social media has significantly fuelled the trend for superlative versions of simple dishes. “Fine-dining fare doesn’t actually photograph that well and generally looks fussy and drab,” says Gabet. “Whereas, dishes such as tacos and burgers have distinct outlines and vibrant colours.”In London, few figures have done more to champion affordable new restaurants, informal supper clubs and food trucks than Clerkenwell Boy, an anonymous food influencer with close to 200,000 followers on Instagram (@Clerkenwell_Boy). “I started Instagramming to try and make food more accessible and less elitist,” he says. “Because, while there is a place for special-occasion fine-dining, on a Tuesday night with friends, we generally want affordable but delicious meals served family-style, in a no-frills setting but with relaxed and friendly service.”And while we might be dining out more, this doesn’t mean we’re lowering our standards. “If we go out for a burger, we want it to be the best burger in town,” says Clerkenwell Boy. “We want to eat simply, but we want it to be the absolute best version of that dish.”As Trish Caddy, Mintel’s senior foodservice analyst, puts it: “Millennials – the generation most likely to consider themselves as ‘foodies’ – have developed an acquired taste for artisanal flavours such as dry-aged meats and smoked cheese, partly out of a desire for visceral, intense experiences that stimulate their senses.”And although consumers are increasingly health-conscious, there’s also been a shift in what we consider an “unhealthy” meal. Burgers and pizzas are no longer demonised there’s a new understanding that excessive sugar, sweeteners, additives and heavy processing are the real culprits in poor health and obesity.“So, instead of eating low-quality processed meats such as fatty pepperoni and sausages, millennials are seeking out functional ingredients like fermented foods that tap into the ongoing gut-friendly food trend,” says Caddy. “For example, sourdough pizzas, which feature purported health benefits that come from the fermentation process, have a distinctive sourness compared to ordinary pizza bread dough. This suits millennials, who have grown accustomed to food with intensive flavours as well as health benefits.”And if diners are rediscovering simple pleasures, the good news is that these dishes are also immensely satisfying to prepare. “Cooking should be about everything from sourcing great ingredients to the therapeutic rituals of breaking down the recipes,” says Erskine. “And everyone should be able to eat, and cook, this way.”Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5faabfe9667ee2cd4464d8524194f0f59fdc91ee/0_0_1035_621/master/1035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c22ffb112a6c6c5b0aa920226f69f539","title":"the slumflowers guide to peckham londons coolest neighbourhood","story":"We spoke to blogger and author Chidera Eggerue (AKA the Slumflower) as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series – where innately curious people reveal the ‘ordinary’ places and things that inspire them. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithVibrant, arty and home to one of London’s most erse communities, Peckham has cemented itself as a true cultural hotspot – with creative hub Peckham Levels, the legendary Bussey Building and no shortage of galleries and cafes just a few of its draws. But long before SE15 was named by Time Out as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, it was the stomping ground of blogger and best-selling author Chidera Eggerue.With 187,000 Instagram followers, Eggerue is now known globally by her online moniker, the Slumflower – a name borrowed from Street Etiquette’s concept of a rose growing from concrete. Her debut book, What a Time to be Alone: the Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, is now in its third print run and she has recently published her second, Scribble Yourself Feminist. Growing up in south-east London, Eggerue mirrors the Slumflower message of growing, glowing and flourishing in an urban environment. Here, she presents her very personal guide to Peckham, reflecting on the everyday extraordinary places that fire up her imagination …Taste some proper Nigerian foodI live with my mum and two brothers and I don’t really eat out much as my mum is an amazing cook. She makes jollof rice, egusi (a type of melon seed) soup, beans and yam. She also shops local and buys her meat and vegetables from the market in Peckham.But if you want to know a good Nigerian restaurant in the area, I would suggest 805 Restaurants – I get plantain and jollof rice. Afterwards, stop by Cafe Spice, a small, yellow shop opposite the Bussey Building. Look out for a Nigerian snack called a puff puff, which is very sweet and like a fried doughnut.Kick back with a drinkJohn the Unicorn is really nice, or Prince of Peckham – it does great chicken, and has really good DJ sets and there’s a party room upstairs. It’s quite new but it’s where I’d go with friends now. People do of course go on to club nights at the CLF Art Cafe – known locally as the Bussey Building (during the summer months there’s a rooftop bar and cinema), but I’m like an 80-year-old granny and just go home!Head to the only cinema worth knowing aboutOnce a month I take myself on an evening date to watch a film at Peckhamplex. I’ve been going there since I was born and it’s still the only cinema I go to – at a fiver a ticket, you can’t go wrong. I saw the new Incredibles film recently, which I loved it was so cute. Going there and having time to myself is important. What is now above it – the creative workplay hub that is Peckham Levels – used to be a multi-storey car park. My dad used to park there before we went to the cinema and he’d whizz around the levels, it was so much fun. Frank’s Cafe is there now, on the rooftop, but it’s not really my thing.Look out for inspiring wall artWhen I was younger, there was a wall by Peckham library with photos of famous black actors, who I very much aspired to be. The bus I took to secondary school went past it, so I’d see them every day from age 11 to 16. Now the murals are on the walls of the Peckhamplex, which I love.Hit up my beauty go-tosPaks Hair and Cosmetics is where I get my hair treatments, conditioners and extensions. I also go to Anna’s nail shop once a month to get my nails done. (Find it in Ali Baba’s barber shop on 127 Rye Lane.) It’s £25 and quite expensive. I always get pointy nails shellac all the way. I get the brightest, neon colours I can. My tip? Get Anna’s son to do them – he’s the best.Get a coffee fixI get my coffee at the Costa on Rye Lane every day, but it’s not very Peckham! It used to be a Mothercare. My mum would always go in there with me and just the other day I was looking at an old film of me in there, which we still have on tape. There was more footage of me in my pram and walking through Peckham. There were green buses then – they were so cool – and the McDonalds is in shot, which is still there.Find some headspaceSexby Garden in Peckham Rye Park is my hideout, my reflection spot – my secret favourite place.

As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we explore how she started a culturequake that’s been felt throughout the media ever since. All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithLiv Little walks into Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour office with a smile that is as big and bright as her red puffer coat, impressive considering how exhausted she is. We’re here to discuss the rise of women and non-binary people of colour in media, an industry in which Little has emerged as a bright new star. It’s the reason we asked her to be part of the  Labs’s and Google Pixel 3’s Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, where innately curious people discuss how they discover the extraordinary all around them. Little collapses into the waiting arms of a slouchy upholstered chair, humbly receiving congrats on the runaway success of her independent digital and print zine, gal-dem, from a producer who has popped in to say hi.In a year that has been “Feminist AF”. In the age of #MeToo, self care, #BlackGirlMagic and #GirlsDoingWhateverTheFuckTheyWant, it’s not surprising that 2018 has also been the year of Little and gal-dem. It’s hard to find a young woman who better sums up the cultural shift. Her publication, with a corrective emphasis on intersectional feminism, is produced by a team of outspoken, socially conscious, whip-smart young women and non-binary people of colour, from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds. It’s a refreshing change from the publishing world’s longstanding homogenous population of largely white, mostly cisgender, predominantly privileged and Oxbridge-educated citizenry.“I wanted to connect with other women and non-binary people of colour. I wanted it to be a free space where people can come and read about experiences like their own,” Little explains of gal-dem’s beginnings. “I realised that it’s a big thing for a black woman to see yourself reflected back.”Add Little to the list of young women interrogating and disrupting historically white, tough-to-break-into professions globally – women such as the newly elected 29-year-old Latinx US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or the black British book publisher Sharmaine Lovegrove.Little and gal-dem reflect the moment as much as they are the moment. And their rise coincides with a new wave of women and non-binary people of colour who felt their voices were not being heard in the everyday, so did something extraordinary to get it out there – notably carving space for themselves in the UK media world including Slay in Your Lane authors Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinené, journalist Afua Hirsch and the influencer and body positivity activist Chidera “The Slumflower” Eggerue.Meanwhile, gal-dem’s growing team of more than 15 editors, writers and assistants have been juggling projects that rival those of legacy publishing giants with exponentially larger staffs – a truly extraordinary achievement. There was the takeover of the  Weekend Magazine in August, during a month when black women ruled the September glossy monthly covers. And then there was the summer launch of gal-dem’s partnership with Liberty London and Dialogue Books to create a literature course, aptly titled Rewriting the Canon and dedicated to iconic authors of colour. Add to that an exhibition they curated in June about the Windrush generation for City Hall and a week-long pop-up with Penguin in November to celebrate the launch of Michelle Obama’s global phenomenon of a book, Becoming. The pop-up featured events that centred on various themes in the former first lady’s memoir – from a discussion about black motherhood to a talk with businesswoman and activist Gina Miller.This hardly scratches the surface of the long list of wins gal-dem has had since Little first launched the project as a student at the University of Bristol back in 2015.Little had an “overwhelmingly positive” childhood, growing up in south-east London with a close relationship to her Buddhist mother and human rights worker aunt (her mum’s identical twin). She didn’t experience the negative and isolating aspects of being a woman of colour navigating white environments until she started university, where she studied politics and sociology. “My childhood was very much about me being comfortable enough to know that my voice is as important as anyone else’s. And then I went to uni and saw a disparity in circumstances that I had never seen before. I was around the super elite for the first time – people who had cards with family bank names on them, people with very conservative beliefs. It was different from what I was used to back home with my mum’s erse roster of friends. I was in a place where I was studying things and suddenly I had this feeling of: ‘Why is there no space for me?’”It was a question women of colour were asking the world over – using everyday, free platforms such as Instagram to create and market the kinds of extraordinary imagery and storytelling they wanted to see, but couldn’t find in mainstream media. And so gal-dem became the UK’s biggest success story in what emerged as a global wave of independent upstarts by women and non-binary people of colour, including Well Read Black Girl – a US-based online book club and content platform-turned Brooklyn literary festival – and Azeema Mag, an annual print zine dedicated to women within the Menasa region (Middle East, north Africa and south Asia).Now, gal-dem is not just a space for Little, but hundreds of contributors around the world, with content that is as erse as its readership. A scroll through the site reveals stories and news that feel very much like the charged WhatsApp threads taking place between women of a certain mindset – outspoken, socially conscious women who identify with prominent outspoken, socially conscious women such as Roxane Gay, Tracee Ellis Ross, Michaela Coel and Yara Shahidi. The articles on gal-dem have titles such as Are you a woke pixie dream girl?, Why Solange is my style icon, and The sex-deprived lives of young women who move back home. The tone strikes a balance that’s difficult to achieve between critical and cheery, knowing and earnest. And it resonates with women of all backgrounds. “I’ve received a lot of emails from white mothers saying that it’s been a really useful resource to help them understand their daughters. And I get a lot of young people asking me what to do to start a magazine,” she says.That leads us to the other extraordinary part of Little’s trajectory that she’s a media success story at a time when the industry is having an identity crisis. “It’s hard because the media is not always the nicest industry to be in and progress through. The environment can be hostile,” Little says, before thinking back to her time navigating jobs at television networks. “I’ve been in situations where I was the only person in the room who looked like me. You can find yourself tokenised.”But for the past year, she’s made gal-dem her full-time job – with the exception of freelance roles as contributing editor of Elle UK and a factual executive producer at the BBC – devoting all of her energy to turning her platform into a viable business. Does it sound like an empire in the making? For Little, it’s all to play for. “It’s now just a case of growing it further,” she says. And with that, a second producer comes in to greet her. It’s time to go on-air.Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/918f8648f8865da47d41868357fe6094ac7b10cc/243_197_848_509/master/848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01eda81d4cbd9e912c3e7365ac96461e","title":"10 ways to make the everyday extraordinary","story":"In this fast-paced digital world, it’s all too easy to live life on autopilot. From rethinking your routine to noticing art and culture around you, as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, here are 10 ways to appreciate the magic of the everyday. All images captured on Google Pixel 3Most of us are settled into our routines. Wake up, check emails, grab a coffee, hop on the train, get to work. It’s not our fault, it’s the efficient way that our brains work. “Having this autopilot mode allows the conscious mind to be freed up for other tasks,” says Gemma Griffith, a director at the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice at Bangor University.However, autopilot mode can have its downsides. By being so wedded to our ingrained habits and routine we can risk becoming disconnected from other people and our surroundings, and missing out on everyday magic. For Griffith the remedy is simple: “It’s about switching back to ‘being’ mode rather than ‘doing’ mode and focusing our attention on the present moment”. Here are 10 ways to shake up your routine and relish the everyday.Take time outYou don’t have to trek to the top of a mountain to find inner peace. Whether you’re on your commute or taking a lunchtime stroll, take the time to open up your awareness. “Focus on your walking, how your feet feel on the ground, the temperature of the weather at that moment, and the sounds you hear,” says Griffith. Coax your mind into the present moment by taking a different route home or trying out a new lunch spot.Be more basicFashion’s love affair with utilitarian dressing continues, with pared-back basics the lynchpins of Instagram’s most followed fashion icons. “The current appetite for streetwear and the rise of high-street stores that specialise in stocking classic key items, such as brands like Arket, prove that the trend for basics is going nowhere,” says stylist Laura Martin. The humble white t-shirt, the classic hoodie and ordinary gym trainers have never been more on trend. The good news is, they’re probably already in your wardrobe.Rethink your favourite foodsThe internet has turned eating into an art form. While home chefs could once have lived a lifetime using only Mrs Beeton’s Cookery Book for company, today we are googling ambitious dishes then feverishly photographing and hashtagging the results. But have we forgotten the simple pleasure of ordinary meals and ingredients? As the zeitgeist turns towards a balanced approach to eating, bloggers such as the Ugly Vegan are performing the seemingly revolutionary act of sharing unfiltered, familiar dishes. For your next evening in, why not grab a bag of imperfect veg and create something extraordinarily ordinary?Notice art around youYou don’t have to go to a gallery to appreciate great art and design: seek out signs of creativity all around you. If you’re in London, look up Art on the Underground’s Brixton mural map, leading to examples of street art in the area dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Manchester? Check out the street art tours on offer by writer Hayley Flynn, who set up bespoke tours of the city to put a spotlight on the local landscape of the Northern Quarter, which is packed with rich history. Over in Bristol, the tourist office has published free, downloadable walking tours of Banksy’s work.Discover hidden librariesFrom repurposed old red phone boxes to shelves at the train station, hidden libraries are popping up everywhere. The literary scheme Read Now, Write Now has teamed up to create book exchange shelves along the Wirral train line, and Clapham North tube station in London has a book swap shelf located at its entrance. Over in Crossmichael in southern Scotland and Amberley in Stroud, locals have turned their old phone boxes into mini libraries. The pleasure in these new makeshift lending libraries? “You get to discover new gems,” says Fruzsina Bekefi who runs a monthly book swap out of east London reading nook Libreria. “It’s a great way to widen my horizons and inject a bit of serendipity into my life.”Find a new perspective There are more than 4m posts for #lookup on Instagram and with good reason: from intricate architecture to stunning skies, there’s so much you could miss if you keep your eyes trained on the ground. And as we shuffle along our daily tramlines, our thinking can get stuck in a rut too. Head up a hillside or tall building for a fresh look at where you live, or mix up your commute by getting off a stop or two early and walking the rest of the way.Discover hidden historyWhether you are a fan of poets, musicians, athletes or writers, it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled for the English Heritage blue plaque scheme. The plaques dotted around London point out where notable creatives lived in the city, from children’s author AA Milne to the black composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The English heritage scheme has also influenced other local areas across the UK to celebrate their histories, too – so look out for blue plaques in Brighton and Hove, South Tyneside and Leeds (thanks to the local Leeds Civic Trust).Shake up your workoutIf your idea of exercise is headphones and a running machine, why not break the habit and explore a more sociable way to exercise? GoodGym hosts running meet-ups across the UK, combining fitness with an activity that benefits the local community. Jog to meet an isolated elderly person, sort out cans at a food bank or pitch in to tidy someone’s garden. A recent study from the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine in the US proved that team exercise can lower stress and improve quality of life.Appreciate moreBusy doesn’t have to equal stress – it’s all about how you approach it, says Griffith. “Do a routine activity mindfully, whether that is brushing your teeth or eating breakfast in the morning, by adjusting your senses to what you are doing,” she says. The benefits of mindfulness are worth it. “It’s a practise that lowers the stress hormone cortisol. It encourages those who apply mindfulness to their daily lives to have more compassion for themselves and others,” says Griffith.Get back to natureGwyneth Paltrow’s love of grounding has been well documented (and much maligned), but how about a spot of forest bathing? This new nature buzzword refers to a rising trend in green spaces inspired by a Japanese tradition. Try it by heading to your local forest or woodland trail and soaking up everything you see, touch, hear and smell. Even if you can’t make it that far afield, swap that “al desko” lunch for some much needed vitamin D – it’s the perfect pick-me-up when daylight hours are in such short supply.Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8048655da8f878ec75b9775351916a6efa192c93/0_85_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff557879c9ada9124295a51248e0b7b9","title":"elon musk boring company tunnel party tonight los angeles","story":"As thousands gather for the first public viewing of Musk’s ‘loop track’, skeptics wonder whether it will live up to its promisesElon Musk enthused that this was no ordinary tunnel opening, but something epic and “incredibly profound”. Skeptics wondered whether it was just a hyped-up coming-out party for a hole in the ground.In the end, the first public viewing of Musk’s latest visionary project – an underground “loop” track that promises to revolutionize transport in the 21st-century city – turned out to be a grand mixture of imaginative futurism and showbiz razzamatazz, not to mention a showcase for a novel tunnel-boring technology that may be the most significant development of all.Whether the technology succeeds in increasing the speed of tunnel construction fifteen-fold, as Musk said he hoped it would, or heralds the beginning of a vast underground network of transport channels beneath our cityscapes, is anybody’s guess.Musk, for one, didn’t sound completely sure. “We’re obviously in the early stages here,” he told reporters. “This is a prototype. We’re figuring things out. What’s really important is that there is a path, finally, finally, finally… to alleviating traffic congestion in cities. If what we’re saying is true, and we think it is, there is finally a solution.”The test tunnel, a 1.1-mile underground track that runs near the headquarters of Musk’s SpaceX company in an unlovely corner of south Los Angeles, was built with relatively conventional tunnel-boring technology for about $10 million. But Musk’s underground construction arm, known as the Boring Company, has already envisioned a second- and third-generation technology that would simultaneously dig the hole, move the dirt out, and automatically install the reinforced concrete tunnel walls.The idea is that, one day, cities will have so many underground layers of tunnel networks that a driver of an autonomous electric car could join the loop at any point and be whisked at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour to a destination programmed in advance. Musk said a station could be just a glorified parking spot with an elevator to take the driver down into the system, or something grander with double-helix spiral ramps.Musk was vague about the timeline and vaguer still about the costs. True to his wayward reputation, he suggested at one point that anyone could copy the technology he was developing free of charge because all he cared about was alleviating traffic congestion. At another point he fantasized about building “infinite real estate underground” on Mars.“I hope we’re one day building tunnels on Mars,” he said. “That would be a glorious day.”Back on planet Earth, a small army of black-clad Boring Company employees was on hand to escort journalists and a crowd of VIP guests down into an area known as the Pit, hop into a Tesla X fitted with special tracking wheels that attached to the sides of the track, and make the test run into the narrow, all-white tunnel.The ride was bumpy – according to Musk, they’ve had problems with their paving machine – and the vehicles went no faster than 40 or 50 miles per hour. Some participants likened it to an amusement-park ride, others to an airport shuttle, or one of those TV hospital dramas where a patient under the knife undergoes the beginnings of the journey to the Great Beyond.Just a couple of minutes into the ride, the tunnel lit up with an eerie green glow to indicate the terminus, and an elevator carried each car up into a residential back alley. It took at least twice as long to make the drive back through traffic, past the Hawthorne municipal airport and the SpaceX building, lined with more white tubing where the company experiments with ultra-high-speed transport technologies.Several cities have expressed strong interest in Musk’s vision – whether to provide a high-speed transportation link, as Chicago hopes to do between O’Hare airport and downtown, or to create a more mundane tunnel network for sewage, electricity and gas lines that could be serviced without the need to break up roads and create more congestion.Everything, though, depends on whether Musk and his colleagues can deliver on their promise of a tunnelling technology that cuts the dizzying cost of installing new light rail or underground train tracks. Musk himself called this “the proof of the pudding”.“We definitely do not have all the answers here,” he added. He even appeared to make fun of would-be funders who have offered to sink their assets in the Boring Company without the usual process of due diligence. “We have people hounding us to invest nonstop,” he said, “which is weird because they haven’t seen the financials. They just assume this will work, and they’re probably right.”The tunnel opening looked, in many ways, like a proof-of-concept demonstration for those investors. And it was plainly a struggle for Musk and his colleagues to get even this far.The opening was originally scheduled eight days ago, only to be scrapped for what the company at the time said was completion of a snail habitat required under environmental regulations. On Tuesday, though, Musk said straight out the system had not been ready.He also appeared to give a more honest answer to the question of why the public was not being invited to try out the tunnel free of charge, as originally promised. The Boring Company explained: “Due to unbelievably high demand, tours through the Hawthorne test tunnel are by invitation only.” Musk said, flatly, that the change of plans was because of “regulatory constraints”.For the grand opening, employees of all three Musk companies – Tesla, the Boring Company and SpaceX – did their best to create a carnival atmosphere, with a large outdoor bar, a museum-style display of the various drilling technologies, and a wall of Elon Musk’s tweets charting the loop project’s progress, all adorned with theatre-style black velvet curtains.One of the weirder landmarks near the tunnel entrance is a medieval-style watchtower, with a brick façade and heavy wooden door – a nod, apparently, to Musk’s love of all things Monty Python. A couple of months ago, Musk said he wanted to hire someone to dress up as a knight, stand at the top of the tower like John Cleese in Monty Python and the Holy Grail and “yell insults at people in a French accent”.Given the constant traffic rumbling past on Crenshaw Boulevard, however, it seemed unlikely the insults would ever be heard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7ad164e95751f06ec320709a7a653843c1c1e11/0_326_4300_2579/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c00505f5e8b823565d9bcf0248bd769","title":"tell us what was your favourite tv show of 2018","story":"As our critics’ countdown continues we want to hear what you’ve been watching this year and which moment stood out the mostJodie Whittaker’s first series of Doctor Who, the surreal second season of Donald Glover’s Atlanta, Michael Palin’s journey to North Korea and a live Halloween episode of Inside Number 9 – all feature on the ’s varied rundown of the top TV in 2018.

Vacancies created by lawmakers who won election to other offices in November then allowed women to gain additional seats.Before 2018, New Hampshire was the first state to have a female majority in any legislative chamber, when women held a majority in the New Hampshire state senate in 2009 and 2010.“It is unprecedented at this point to see a majority female legislature overall,” said Kelly Dittmar, an assistant professor of political science at Rutgers-Camden.Studies of women who have served in Congress are probably comparable to female gains in state legislatures, she said, and the studies have found that “the more women you have in the body, the more that their perspectives and life experiences are integrated into policy debates and deliberations”.Dittmar said the milestone in Nevada could help change attitudes of what a state legislature should like.“That might influence young people. It might influence other women to see that body as both friendlier to them as well as more responsive to their concerns,” she said.Nguyen, an attorney, and Duran, a grievance specialist with the state’s casino workers union, will hold their seats until the next general election in 2020.“It’s a great victory,” Duran told the Associated Press in a telephone interview.“Women are proving to have more knowledge and aren’t afraid to show that power that they have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b60d8afa79852962ba1558bf165c6b518fcdf3b8/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49fa4b97e6aa4f967c04a6be6689da1a","title":"how your holiday shopping drives us amazon workers to exhaustion","story":"In the third installment of The Amazon Diaries, a worker describes the madness that is the six-week ‘peak’ seasonTime at Amazon is measured in the amount of “peak” you work. Peak, we are told, is the time when Amazon associates shine. We are forged in peak we are made complete by packing and shipping the Christmas and holiday dreams of people worldwide. Records are set, and we have fun while making history.Peak refers to the “peak” season, lasting from the week before Black Friday through Christmas. During this six-week period, the volume of packages running through our fulfillment, sortation and delivery centers soars. Full-time workers receive “mandatory extra-time”, working up to 60 hours per week with exhausting 11.5-12 hour days, while part-time workers are encouraged to take as many extra shifts as possible. Our workforce doubles with “seasonal” workers who are paid less, not given benefits, and put on a restrictive time-off allowance, ensuring they’ll be working through the holiday season. Walking into my sort center, where packages are organized on pallets ready to be sent out to customers, it’s clear it’s mid-peak. Posters are scattered throughout the warehouse showing an associate holding an electronic scanner, like she’s in a photoshoot for Charlie’s Angels, with the slogan, “Be All Peak Pro”. We’re told to post our #Peak18 rallying cry to the company’s Instagram page, @amazonvestlife. My friend tells me that if I ever post him to @amazonvestlife he’ll kill me. Guiding us through a “stand up”, management tells us we’re going to “kill it” today, to set new records for boxes processed on our shift. Aren’t we psyched to break records? Management claps and hoots. We’ll be rewarded, they say: a handful of associates randomly drawn may win a Kindle or an Echo Dot. My friend whispers to me, “We set the records, pay us in cash.”Soon the early excitement and anticipation of the first few days of peak madness have dissipated we’re mostly just exhausted, and counting down the days until it’s over.Walking on to the sort floor the day after Cyber Monday, boxes of various sizes flood the conveyor belts. The normally orderly warehouse has trash strewn everywhere, random pieces of wood, tape, gloves and broken product on the concrete floor. Shoddily built pallets of boxes, normally stacked and wrapped with relative precision, are cascading on to the ground. Our friends and co-workers walk past us, their feet dragging like zombies after having worked the last 10 hours, many for six days in a row. A few folks who learned their lesson last year refuse extra-time – they say that one five-hour shift is hard enough, doing two is unbearable.As I reach my station I bargain with a friendly manager not to go to the hardest trucks for the day, my shoulders and neck aching from 10 hours of non-stop pushing the day before (and the day before, and the day before). He does me a solid and lets me take on an easier task. I see stress in the bags under his eyes, knowing that he is expected to work around the clock under immense pressure. A manager in his cohort had walked out mid-shift earlier in the week, fed up and pissed off.The whir of the belt picks up, marking the beginning of shift. From the jump we’re pushed to the limit, and it won’t stop until the moment we leave. Blue lights blink, signaling that we’re working too slow. A new “seasonal” manager looking to impress upper management comes by and tells us to pick up the pace while he just walks by without offering a hand. Thanks, buddy.Several of us in break room conversations, in the back of trucks, in the smoking area, and working the line, whisper and share articles about worker actions during peak: “Did you hear they are going on strike in Europe?” “I heard they are walking out the day before Christmas in Germany, Italy and Spain.” “I hear people are walking out in Minnesota this year – it’s happening in the US!” “Did you hear what happened in New York? I heard they were forming a union.” “We need to do that here!”And just like that, the day after Christmas, peak ends. Managers start talking to floor leaders, asking which seasonal workers busted their ass. Last year, that was when the culling of seasonal associates began, people fired mid-shift by text message. Not an hour later, texts went out seeking volunteers for overtime for the next two weeks. The text was accidentally sent to some of those who had just been fired. One of them, my friend, kicked a pallet over, said “fuck this” and marched out the building. Promises of conversion vanish for some, while others say good riddance and are on their way.Our backs may be aching, our bodies exhausted, our pay still the same, but at least we broke some records. America’s sweatshop firing on all cylinders hundreds of millions of “customer promises” fulfilled. @amazonvestlife."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3736147.1545164782!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish university makes first brexit inspired academic appointment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Séamus Davis graduated with  a BSc in Physics at UCC in 1983 and has since gone on to become a leading global figure in the field of quantum matter. Photograph: Clare KeoghThe first in a series of world-class academic appointments aimed at capitalising on Brexit and uncertainty in the US is to be announced on Wednesday.UCC has made a joint appointment with Oxford University of a leading experimental quantum physicist, Prof Séamus Davis.The appointment is being supported through a Science Foundation Ireland research professorship, which provides for top academics and researchers to be appointed on salaries of up to €250,000.Irish higher education chiefs hope to support further joint professorships for outstanding researchers between Irish and leading UK universities.They believe uncertainty in the UK and US scientific communities due to the combined effects of Brexit and US president Donald Trump’s controversial policies has the potential to make Ireland a more attractive location.Latest figures indicate there has been a huge fall-off in international students in the UK due to a perception it is not as welcoming as before, while there has been a 30 per cent increase of applications in Ireland.Prof Davis, meanwhile, will spearhead a pioneering research programme to study quantum materials for quantum technology.In a statement, he said the rapidly accelerating “second quantum revolution” promises transformative advances in science, industry, economy and society.“In Ireland a spectacularly sophisticated research ecosystem has been nurtured and has rapidly grown, and I am very much looking forward to returning home to Cork and to working with my colleagues in UCC,” he said.The research programme focuses on direct, atomic-scale visualisation of electronic states in quantum materials, and requires a highly specialised ultra-low-vibration (ULV) laboratory environment.Irish policy-makers hope the appointment will enhance our reputation for quantum materials and quantum technology research, as well as enhance the training and experience of the early-career researchers involved.John Halligan, Minister of State for Training, Skills, Innovation, Research and Development, said the appointment was a “significant achievement for Ireland”.“Recruiting world-class researchers that have led groundbreaking research developments is a priority for the Irish Government, as is fostering partnerships with both national and global institutions,” he said.Prof Mark Ferguson, director-general of Science Foundation Ireland, said the appointment would bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise in quantum physics to Ireland.“This is the first joint appointment under the SFI Research Professorship programme, and we hope to fund many more joint appointments in the future,” he said.UCC president Prof Patrick O’Shea said Prof Davis’s work at the interface between discovery and innovation will be crucial in advancing us into this “new age of opportunity”.Prof Davis graduated with a BSc in Physics at UCC in 1983 and has since gone on to become a leading global figure in the field of quantum matter.For the past 10 years Prof Davis was based at Cornell University and was senior physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. He is a fellow of the prestigious US National Academy of Sciences.His research achievements to date include the design and demonstration of the first spectroscopic imaging scanning tunnelling microscope, the invention of quasiparticle interference imaging, breakthrough work on the Cooper-pairing mechanisms of correlated superconductors, discovery of the superfluid Josephson effect, and the discovery of several new phases of electronic matter.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Eamon WardThere can be few rescuers in any coastal community anywhere occupying the tough and lonely position held by west Clare farmer Bernard Lucas.Bernard and his wife, Caitríona Lucas, trained as advanced search-and-rescue coxswains with one of the Irish Coast Guard’s leading voluntary teams in Doolin, Co Clare. More than two years ago, the 41-year old mother of two became the first Irish Coast Guard member to die on duty . She drowned when the rigid inflatable boat (rib) she was in capsized on September 12th, 2016, during a search for a missing man with a neighbouring unit in Kilkee.In his first interview since publication of one of two State investigations, Bernard is calm and measured as he recalls how his wife had not expected to go to sea that day. She had agreed to make up the numbers when Kilkee were short of seagoing crew.He was not initially aware that the Kilkee unit was the focus of a rescue when he responded to an emergency tasking some hours later. “I was in Milltown Malbay when I got a phone call and turned the car around for Doolin,” he says. “At that stage we just knew a boat had capsized off Kilkee.”He was en route to the location with fellow Doolin volunteers Conor McGrath and Davy Spillane when a message over the VHF radio directed their rib into Kilkee. A Garda car was waiting at the pier head. Bernard was driven to a cliff top, where his wife was being attended to by paramedics before being flown by Irish Coast Guard helicopter to Limerick University Hospital. Several hours later, she was pronounced dead.The two Kilkee crew with her – coxswain James Lucey and second coxswain Jenny Caraway – were rescued. The damning final report of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) has identified a catalogue of safety defects and lack of regulatory compliance, and criticises the Irish Coast Guard for failing to have an effective safety management system in place.Although its role is not to apportion blame, the report states that the Kilkee rib had critical equipment deficiencies, that it was out beyond its operational limits, that it should have had a passenger boat licence and that its coxswain should have had the necessary certification for this.It also notes how recommendations arising from a similar incident in a shallow “surf zone” off Dingle in 2014 had not been fully acted upon by the Irish Coast Guard in order to prevent a recurrence. And it says criteria for launching in a situation where the focus is on “recovery”, as opposed to search and rescue, should be reviewed.In its response to the MCIB draft report, which it described as “flawed” and “misleading”, the Irish Coast Guard pointed out that more than a million “man hours” had been spent on more than 30,000 rescue missions since 1991 and that this was the first fatality. It also argued against passenger boat legislation – on the basis that rescue ribs are not ferries – and defended the Kilkee unit’s decision to launch.The Irish Coast Guard also defended its safety-management system and contended that it represented a “significant leap” for the MCIB to suggest a “tragic accident in one instance in one Coast Guard unit is representative of a whole organisation”.Bernard is taking legal advice on the report, so he does not want to comment on its specifics, and he is conscious that a separate Health and Safety Authority (HSA) investigation is pending. He is also due to meet Minister for Transport Shane Ross, who holds responsibility for the Irish Coast Guard, this week.However, in a submission to the draft MCIB report, which has been published as part of a length appendix to the final version, Bernard raised a number of issues relating to faulty equipment that the investigation had identified but, in his view, had not adequately explored.He also stated that he believed “bullying and harassment” at Kilkee in the preceding couple of years was “a contributing factor in this accident”. Kilkee had “lost an awful lot of experience” and “morale within the team was very bad”, he noted.The MCIB report does record management difficulties at Kilkee, which led to a number of coxswains with local knowledge leaving the unit. Irish Coast Guard senior management was first alerted to the issue in late March 2016, and met with volunteers in July. At a further meeting, on September 9th, 2016 – three days before Caitríona’s death – Kilkee volunteers were informed that their officer in charge was taking up a new posting, and that the deputy officer in charge, Orla Hassett, would take over in the interim.Hassett had previously initiated a grievance procedure, after she says she was isolated and excluded from training schedules by her senior officer, Martony Vaughan. Her concerns about safety were compounded by two incidents with a ladder deemed unsafe at the Kilkee base. She fell off it, and one of her colleagues also fell off it and had to be airlifted to hospital with an injured back.Events overtook the new management transition, as the sea search for missing school inspector David McMahon was initiated on September 10th. Bernard’s submission to the MCIB states that there seemed to be “confusion about who was in charge during and after the accident” two days later.It took more than four hours to rescue coxswain James Lucey from an inaccessible cave entrance. Several jet-ski teams risked their lives to try and approach him. Doolin Coast Guard and Kilrush Fire Service cliff teams eventually managed to get him a line and he was winched to safety by the Irish Coast Guard Rescue 117 helicopter from Waterford.Hassett had to ask for Garda help to requisition a privately owned rib, and then boarded Kilkee’s D-class rib and rescued one of the two Kilkee crew, Jenny Caraway.Bernard believes that the Irish Coast Guard’s management system allowed no recourse for volunteers who might have concerns that could lead to differences with an officer in charge. His colleague Davy Spillane, musician and also an advanced search-and-rescue coxswain, agrees. “If you questioned issues, you were told by your senior ‘This was not a democracy’ and were pointed to the door,” Spillane says. Bernard recorded one key instance in September 2017, at a memorial ceremony in Doolin for his wife and for the four Irish Coast Guard helicopter crew who lost their lives in a crash off the north Mayo coast in March 2017. After the ceremony, he says he was admonished by his officer in charge, Mattie Shannon, for travelling to Blacksod six months previously to assist in the search for the helicopter crew.“I just couldn’t stay at home,” Bernard says. “ I suppose I was up there the best part of two weeks, and I had brought my all-weather gear with me – but I went as a civilian. I met Michael Hurst, officer in charge of the Ballyglass unit, and he was very welcoming and asked me to put on my gear.”During one of many shoreline scans, Bernard found a glove worn by one of the crew. He also met the families. More than most, he understood their shock and pain.Mattie Shannon, who retired from the officer-in-charge post after 30 years of distinguished service with Doolin, has declined to comment on Bernard’s claim in relation to participating in the Blacksod search but said: “I wish Bernard every goodwill in his endeavours and solace and peace to him and his family for Christmas.” It is understood that Shannon would have been under pressure to ensure there was no “self-tasking” during a highly pressurised search situation when the emphasis was on avoiding further accidents or casualties.Bernard says he recorded the exchange and submitted it as one of two complaints to the Irish Coast Guard, but it was not admitted on the grounds that Shannon had already retired.The Irish Coast Guard says it would not be appropriate to comment on inidual grievance processes in the interests of all those involved.There was another key moment for Bernard just over 12 months ago, when he learned that Martony Vaughan, former officer in charge at Kilkee, was transferring back to the Doolin unit.“I wasn’t suggesting any blame – it was just that it was so insensitive. I asked the Irish Coast Guard to defer it until at least the reports were completed,” Bernard says. “That didn’t happen.”“The Irish Coast Guard was my life, it was what I did, and I felt protected by my comrades. That was all blown apart when I heard about this.”“It made it impossible for me to be there and prevented me from grieving. I needed the Irish Coast Guard. I was clinging on by my fingernails.” Spillane believes that Bernard has been effectively abandoned by headquarters at a time when he needed support. The Irish Coast Guard says an offer of counselling support was offered to an inidual last February. Meanwhile, Spillane has been left in his own limbo, he says. There was no official debrief for the Doolin crew on its return to base from Kilkee, he says. Such debriefs allow for issues to be aired and provide a “safe space” after traumatic circumstances.As part of Irish Coast Guard practice, so-called “hot” debriefs take place immediately after every operation to allow for any issues to be aired, and a “cold” debrief may take place some days later if there are outstanding issues. Neither happened in Doolin on this occasion.A separate critical incident stress management debrief was offered to both the Doolin and Kilkee units several days later, but it was attended by two senior Irish Coast Guard officers – against normal practice. During a safety check also attended by Irish Coast Guard management, Spillane reported that his dry suit had begun to fill with water.Further examination showed the seal was at fault. Unbeknown to him, a similar problem had been identified with a dry suit neck seal in Kilkee. The Irish Coast Guard says its dry suits are serviced annually by service agents.Orla Hassett, who is a paramedic by profession, is on sick leave from volunteering with Kilkee. She is one of several members taking legal action on post-traumatic stress relating to the incident and events before and after. She also made a lengthy submission to the MCIB, questioning the accuracy of its location of the incident, among other issues.Like Bernard, Hassett believes the MCIB report did not adequately address equipment failure. The MCIB report confirms that life jackets worn by the three crew were not inflated, and that helmets came off. Volunteers wear life jackets that have to be manually inflated, but this can restrict manoeuvrability in a situation where one is trying to swim or board a rib.Hassett says volunteers understood that the type of life jacket used by the Irish Coast Guard has sufficient buoyancy to keep a head above water in a situation where the wearer is unconscious – as Caitríona Lucas was latterly. Drone footage from the scene confirms she was washed ashore under the cliff with the rib and was holding on to the port bow section but was repeatedly washed off by waves.“After approximately three minutes, the casualty lost her grip and was next sighted lying face down in the water and drifting freely with the seas,” the report states. Preliminary post-mortem evidence confirmed she had sustained a head injury.The Irish Coast Guard says it would not be appropriate to comment on equipment issues while a separate HSA investigation is ongoing, but says its equipment is maintained to a very high standard.It says that while no certified life jacket can be guaranteed to “self-right” an unconscious user – and this is stated in a manufacturer’s warning panel – “the buoyancy provided should ensure they will in the great majority of cases”.It also says it has conducted independent testing of life jackets in Britain and found them to be “fully compliant” for use in Atlantic waters.Co Clare solicitor Joe Chambers, who is acting for Hassett and two other clients, says the care provided to the volunteers “post incident” by the Irish Coast Guard was “late and limited”, and the trauma was in some cases “compounded by its actions. He says his three clients continue to receive private help at their own expense.Kilkee still has no fully restored search unit, and the Irish Coast Guard says it has appointed a project manager, and training is ongoing , with a view to returning the unit’s D class boat to “full operability” next spring.Minister for Transport Shane Ross has pledged to implement the MCIB report recommendations in full. He says he has broadened the national search-and-rescue framework review, and has also instructed the Irish Coast Guard to accelerate its work in developing an independently accredited ISO safety-management system.However, Lucas, Spillane, Hassett and her Kilkee colleagues Lorraine Lynch and Gary Kiely firmly believe that the Minister must also address the fundamental culture within the Irish Coast Guard which, in their view, is anathema to effective teamwork and safety.The Irish Coast Guard says it does offer both critical incident stress management and confidential counselling for volunteers in the aftermath of stressful incidents. It also says it recently contracted a human resources company, which verified that its code of practise in relation to handling grievances represented “good practice for the type of operation involved”.It says training has been and “continues to be” provided by sectoral managers, officers in charge and deputies on “grievance management and other HR supports”.Former Kilkee officer in charge Martony Vaughan did not respond when contacted by The . The MCIB said “all relevant facts are contained in the published report “ and it had “no further comment to make”.The HSA investigation is understood to be nearing conclusion."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3735975.1545161957!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit heckler ejected from irish embassy annoyed at envoy s second vote joke","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJournalist Joanna Bell (left) with Kim Kardashian. File photograph: Joanna BellTwitterA Daily Mail journalist who was ejected from a party at the Irish embassy in London for heckling the Ambassador’s speech said she was annoyed at his suggestion of a possible second Brexit referendum.Joanna Bell, a Daily Mail journalist who is originally from a village near Dundalk, Co Louth, was asked to leave the Embassy’s Christmas party on Monday evening after disrupting the speech given by Irish Ambassador Adrian O’Neill.Ms Bell interrupted Mr O’Neill’s address at the festive drinks reception after he made comments intended to be humorous on the possibility of the UK’s departure from the EU being put to a second vote.When the Ambassador spoke about the risks to the Northern Ireland peace process from Brexit and the potential for a hard border affecting Border communities, Ms Bell reportedly shouted: “Bor-ing!”At another point, she shouted “Brexit!” before being escorted from the room at the Embassy near Westminster.The Embassy’s “Politics \u0026amp Press” party, a popular event in London’s social calendar for politicos and journalists, was attended by prominent figures from politics and the media. British chancellor Philip Hammond, Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley and Jonathan Stephens, permanent secretary of the Northern Ireland Office, Lord Jeffrey Archer and his wife Mary, and former UK defence secretary Michael Fallon were among the guests at the event.One attendee said the journalist’s outburst was “totally out of sync with the people in the room” who were at the event on business, including some who were there because of the importance of the Brexit process.Ms Bell, a former Irish customs officer, voted for the UK to remain in the EU in the Brexit referendum but describes herself now as “a staunch Brexiteer” and a “big advocate of democracy” in support of the 2016 vote.She believes that European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and others in the EU have behaved in a “contemptible manner” towards UK prime minister Theresa May and this has made her switch her support.Suggestions of a second Brexit referendum have reminded her of how Irish voters were asked to vote again on the Lisbon Treaty referendum in 2009.Speaking to The , Ms Bell said her unfortunate ejection from the Embassy followed a\u0026nbspresponse to the suggestion\u0026nbspby the Ambassador that a second Brexit referendum should take place.\u0026nbsp“A second referendum would have the highly unfortunate consequences for this polarised and still combustible island. It’s not that mandates should never be withdrawn or a referendum reconsidered,” she said.“If, however, a democratic outcome is to be re-considered, it must first be respected. What could be more damaging than a second referendum if Remain wins as narrowly as it lost the first? We would find ourselves in a precarious state.”However, witnesses at the reception insisted that the Ambassador had never said that the British should hold a second referendum, but rather had made a humorous remark about its future options.Ms Bell in a statement to The  apologised unreservedly to the Ambassador and his wife for disrupting their party.“Obviously, I profoundly regret the excessive robustness and perhaps lack of finesse with which I expressed my disagreement with the ambassador,” she said.“I had, I confess, enjoyed a good lunch with an eccentric aristocrat who is a staunch Brexiteer.”Ms Bell said she worked as a customs guard on the Border in Cavan, Monaghan and Louth in 2006, based out of Dundalk.The Department of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the incident at the Embassy.Mr O’Neill, known for his calm and unflappable manner, is said to have noticed Ms Bell’s interjection but “handled it fairly diplomatically,” said one attendee.In his speech, the Ambassador told guests that he was grateful for the “goodwill and friendship” the embassy has benefited from in London.He also thanked them “for that sense of friendship towards the embassy, towards Ireland and above all towards continued warm and friendly relations between our two countries”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The Chinese government will continue a multi-year effort against pollution, poverty and financial sector risks, while underlining commitment to the multilateral global trading system,  President Xi Jinping said at a Beijing ceremony celebrating 40 years of reform and opening up. Photograph: Qilai ShenBloombergA major exhibition at Beijing’s National Museum, which celebrates 40 years of reform and opening up, credits late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping with getting change under way – but the real star of the show is President Xi Jinping.A erse range of displays in The Great Revolution exhibition shows the first Chinese share certificate from 1984, the first patent issued a year later, as well as ration coupons from the 1960s, robot legs for amputees, a model of China’s domestic airliner C-919, and the high-speed train – one of the great technological achievements of the last decade.The scale of the exhibition, covering China’s political, economic, cultural and military life in the past four decades, makes it feel like a rallying call as China tries to maintain a stable economy during an increasingly tense trade war with the US.Security at the museum is tight. Crowds of People’s Liberation Army personnel are visiting the show, while People’s Armed Police units march up and down outside. The vast exhibition space is packed with cadres, police officers and work units from government offices.There are exhibits marking landmark events. Ireland’s Peter Sutherland is depicted in negotiations with officials about China joining the World Trade Organisation, which it eventually did in 2001.China was effectively closed to the outside world during the period of ideological chaos known as the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). After the death of Chairman Mao in 1976, the economy was in disarray. New leader Deng Xiaoping introduced various market economy reforms and opened the country up to foreign investment in December 1978, and since then the economy has been transformed into the world’s second largest.Deng also put in place a political system where power was shared at the higher echelons, and introduced term limits to make sure a dangerous cult of personality did not emerge again.Xi has abolished term limits, however, and this exhibition shows how he has very much placed himself at the core of the party. The president’s philosophy, the “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”, has been enshrined in the constitution.Deng’s face is one of the first things you see when you pass through the vast central area, lined with giant screens, and enter the exhibition proper. There are sections dealing with presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, but the lion’s share of the political section of the exhibition is devoted to Xi.Under Xi, the Communist Party has a more prominent role in public life. Private companies such as the carmaker Geely, and Alibaba, whose billionaire founder Jack Ma was recently outed as a Communist Party member, have high profiles at the show – but it is state-owned enterprises and products that really stand out.Reform of the military has seen cutbacks in personnel to about 2 million troops, but also brought massive investment in technology. In the military section you are confronted by images of the country’s two aircraft carriers, spearheading an exhibit of homegrown rockets, tanks and other military vehicles. Here Xi sports his camouflaged uniform in his role as head of China’s military.One of Xi’s main policies has been a crackdown on corruption, and there is a room dedicated to the success of the campaign, decorated with a large, glowing hammer-and-sickle emblem.Since the party’s disciplinary arm, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, started its investigations in 2012, more than 1.5 million corrupt officials have been punished.Among the items on display here is a letter of self-criticism by Lu Wei, the former internet chief who once visited Facebook’s US headquarters and hung out with Mark Zuckerberg before he fell victim to the anti-graft campaign.“I have made serious and unforgivable mistakes, politically, economically, at work and in life, and abandoned the principle and the bottom line as a member of the Communist Party,” he writes.Lu mentions bringing shame on his family, and refers to charges against him that he exchanged favours and influence for sex.“We argued a lot about my lifestyle. She has given up on me. She once told me angrily that ‘I cannot manage you, but the Communist Party will regulate you sooner or later.’”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3736167.1545166881!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu dismisses london s talk of managed no deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May’s cabinet agreed to ramp up preparations in case MPs were to reject the withdrawal agreement next month. Photograph: Leon NealGetty ImagesThe European Union will on Wednesday publish contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit, a day after Theresa May’s cabinet agreed to ramp up preparations in case MPs were to reject the withdrawal agreement next month.Ministers agreed to implement no-deal plans “in full”, including reserving ferry space for supplies of food and medicine and keeping 3,500 armed troops in readiness to deal with any disruption.The EU will make clear that it will not negotiate any “mini-deals” with the UK but will instead take unilateral action to protect European citizens and businesses from the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit. The Bank of England warned last month about the potentially catastrophic impact of Britain leaving without a deal, which could lead to long delays at ports and an abrupt plunge in the value of sterling.The EU has already outlined minimal plans to allow flights to continue between the UK and EU in the immediate wake of Brexit, although British airlines will not be allowed to fly routes from one European airport to another unless they have a base within the EU. There will be measures to avoid disruption in the financial sector, including allowing some transactions to continue to be cleared in London.But the EU wants to snuff out speculation in London about a “managed no-deal”, which some Brexiteers have suggested would see Britain paying the EU for a transition period and for sectoral deals to ease the impact of an abrupt Brexit. Ireland will on Thursday publish an updated no-deal plan, which will outline further details of measures at ports and airports and a call to business to escalate its preparations.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

However, Theresa May’s circle has a sudden pep in its step amid a bout of pre-Christmas optimism about next month’s vote on her Brexit deal.Brexiteer shop steward Jacob Rees-Mogg, who last week called on the prime minister to resign even after she won a confidence vote in her leadership, fell meekly into line on Tuesday.“She won the vote, and therefore I have to accept the result of a democratic vote – similar to what I’ve been saying about the referendum. We have had a referendum. A decision has been made, and, as I say, I am not in favour of a losers’ vote,” he told the BBC.Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group (ERG) of backbench Brexiteers said they would support the prime minister in a vote of no confidence tabled by Jeremy Corbyn, a promise echoed by the DUP. The DUP’s 10 MPs, who have not supported the government in recent votes, have been on more cordial terms with May’s team in recent days.May told the backbench 1922 Committee last week that her Brexit deal could only win a majority in the House of Commons with the support of the DUP. And some of her advisers now believe she can win that support in time for next month’s vote. This newfound optimism at Westminster finds no echo in Brussels, however, after the prime minister’s disastrous performance at last week’s European Council. The other 27 leaders told her there would be no further reassurances beyond those set out in the meeting’s official conclusions, and they stressed that there could be no change to the withdrawal agreement.They were sceptical about her chances of winning parliamentary approval for her deal even with further reassurances about the backstop. And they left the meeting convinced that making any concessions to Britain now would be to “throw good money after bad”, as one senior EU official put it.There have been no Brexit negotiations, even on the most technical level, since last week’s summit, and there is no prospect of any until the new year. With the Commons debate on the Brexit deal starting in the week of January 7th, that doesn’t offer much opportunity for the backstop breakthrough May needs to win over the DUP and her own Brexiteers.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaTheresa May’s cabinet has agreed to ramp up planning for a no-deal Brexit, telling government departments to make contingency planning their top priority. The plans include chartering ferries for supplies of food and medicines and putting thousands of armed troops on standby to help with any disruption.At the end of a 2½-hour meeting in Downing Street, ministers agreed to implement no-deal planning in full.“Cabinet agreed that with just over three months from our exit from the EU, we have now reached the point where we need to ramp up these preparations. This means we will now set in motion the remaining elements of our no-deal plans. Cabinet also agreed to recommend businesses ensure they are similarly prepared enacting their own no-deal plans,” the prime minister’s official spokesman said.The government will contact businesses directly to advise them on how to prepare for the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal and use television advertising and social media to inform the general public. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson said he had not yet received any formal requests from government departments for help from the armed forces in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“What we are doing is putting contingency plans in place, and what we will do is have 3,500 service personnel held at readiness, including regulars and reserves, in order to support any government department on any contingencies they may need,” he said.MPs will vote on the prime minister’s Brexit deal in mid-January but it appears unlikely to win a majority without changes to the Northern Ireland backstop. EU leaders told Mrs May in Brussels last week that they could offer clarifications about the backstop but that the text of the withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated or amended.Conservative MP Nick Boles, who wants Britain to remain in the customs union and the single market, said on Tuesday that he would resign the party whip and vote with Labour rather than allow a no-deal Brexit to happen.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said he did not believe the prime minister would ever authorise a no-deal Brexit because it would leave every part of Britain worse off.“It would also mean no common security arrangements in place and a hard border in Northern Ireland. It would be catastrophic for the UK. That’s why no deal has never truly been a viable option. It is a political hoax, and deep down, deep down, I think the government, and this prime minister, knows it,” he said.“I know from personal experience how seriously she takes security arrangements for the United Kingdom. To put us in a position where that could be jeopardised is not something that, deep down, I think she thinks could possibly be acceptable for this country.”Labour activists who favour a second referendum have called on Jeremy Corbyn to convene a special conference to agree the party’s plans for Brexit over the next few weeks. Mr Corbyn said on Monday that he was tabling a vote of no confidence in the prime minister over Brexit but he has resisted calls to table a no-confidence vote in the government itself."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website.

However, the company has blamed unsafe conditions and said it could bring legal action to recoup the cost of damage to the ship and the Russian Embassy has launched an investigation.The 16,000 tonne ship was grounded in the early hours of Tuesday morning and the Falmouth coastguard and the RNLI undertook a day-long mission to rescue it and its 18 crew members.Volunteers battled through gale force 9 winds to get the Kuzma Minin which had sailed from the Netherlands to the UK some days previously, safely afloat.There were worries that if they did not manage to float it at high tide, around 1.15pm, they would have to wait until the tide came back in at around 1am, leaving the crew members stuck onboard. Luckily, they managed to tug it out to sea at around 2.30pm.Dramatic footage showed a coastguard pilot being winched onto the ship from a helicopter to help those on board.However, the deputy director of the Murmansk Shipping Company, which owns the Kuzma Minin, said the ship had become stuck due to unsafe shipping conditions off the British coast.Murmansk is one of the primary shipping companies operating in northern Europe and Arctic Russia The ship got caught on some sort of chain that was on the bottom of the strait, Ildar Neverov told state news agency RIA Novosti.That is to say there were unsafe shipping conditions in the place where the ship was located. As a result, it passed some distance out of control and ran aground. The situation is under control.He said that he may bring legal action, adding: “We will clearly state our position on the fact that the conditions for safe navigation in this area have not been created... we will definitely look at recovery of damages.”The Falmouth coastguard declined to comment.It was thought that the weather conditions contributed to the accident, and Met Office had issued a yellow warning for severe weather with 65mph winds forecast. Gales were recorded at up to 74mph in Cornwall and 40 knots on the River Tamar - disrupting traffic.Former Falmouth senior pilot captain David Barnicoat told BBC Radio Cornwall: It’s a classic grounding in bad weather and strong winds. The wind overnight was pretty horrendous. Where I live I hadn’t heard wind like it for quite a few years.It sounds as if she dragged anchor and the engines may not have been ready or she may have had some other problem. Once that anchor breaks from the sea bed and you start dragging then you have no control whatsoever.The Falmouth coastguard has been contacted for comment about the safety of the shipping conditions. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the 590ft ship had dragged its anchor and has a list of about five degrees.The RNLI added: Falmouth RNLI volunteers have been afloat since 6.15am in horrendous conditions assisting a 16,000 tonne Russian cargo ship which ran aground off Gyllyngvase beach earlier this morning (Tuesday 18 December).Volunteer crews were woken abruptly to the sound of their pagers shortly after 6am, with a request from Falmouth Coastguard to launch the all-weather lifeboat Richard Cox Scott.With coxswain John Blakeston at the command, the lifeboat proceeded to the scene off Gyllyngvase beach, arriving shortly after 6.20am. The lifeboat has been standing by the vessel since to ensure everyone’s safety.The volunteers have missed a day at work and have re-arranged their plans for the day to help the situation, illustrating their dedication and commitment to saving lives at sea.Winter solstice: Why pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year (a day late) Brexit latest news: Sajid Javid refuses to say whether Government remains committed to driving net migration down to the tens of thousandsWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?Managed no deal: What exactly does it mean for Brexit - and what will happen?Prison guards send \u0026#34thank you\u0026#34 letters to well-behaved inmatesComment: The Government\u0026#39s strategy for combating sexual harassment falls well short of what is neededThai internet star apologises over alleged criticism of Miss Universe gown designed by king\u0026#39s daughterComment: We\u0026#39ve won the War on Terror, but Russia presents a rising new threatNicola Sturgeon makes second EU referendum her top Brexit target ahead of Theresa May talksComment: If Tory Leavers truly believe in Brexit, they must be willing to bring down this train-wreck governmentElon Musk unveils landmark tunnel in Los Angeles in bid to eliminate city trafficWomen told mammogram was a \u0026#39false positive\u0026#39 are twice as likely as those with negative result to end up with cancerNo more excuses: health chiefs vow to step up war on salt as targets to cut content missed Universities warned to curb \u0026#39spiralling\u0026#39 grade inflationCashless revolution \u0026#39happening too fast\u0026#39 as millions of consumers face exclusion from shops and restaurantsTheresa May\u0026#39s flagship immigration policy hit by last-minute Cabinet rowBusiness watches political infighting \u0026#39in horror\u0026#39 with just 100 days to go until BrexitExercise could be as good as drugs at cutting high blood pressure Mother of two appeals for release of husband held on drug charges in Bali The Long Song, episode 1 review: a pertinent, unexpectedly comic tale of slavery’s endWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"best dates poor substitute senses good news governments scrapping","story":"Forget the labels – have a good sniff instead Currently, my fridge contains, among other things: one browning, increasingly squishy aubergine, a very floppy parsnip, half a bag of pre-cooked grains opened at least a week ago, and a block of feta of indeterminate age (what can I say, it’s nearly Christmas and we’re running food stocks down before going away).According to my extremely unscientific polling on this state of affairs, the world can be broadly ided into two different attitudes as to the contents of my fridge: those who (like me) see these sad, abandoned, possibly toxic foodstuffs as an opportunity not to be wasted, and those who think they should go straight into the bin.

It’s irresponsible behaviour.”Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana, 31, who has a masters in design from a French university, created a range of swimsuits and two Thai silk evening dresses for the Miss Universe pageant, which took place in Bangkok at the weekend. Mr Kitjanut did not specify Ms Wanchaleom’s alleged crime. But her reportedly negative comments about one of the princess’s dresses sparked online outrage on Monday.Miss Thailand, Sophida Kanchanarin, made the top ten of the Miss Universe finalCriticism of the royal family is taboo in Thailand, where several people have been convicted under strict lese majeste laws.  After her post went viral, Ms Wanchaleom issued an apology, saying that she “did not have any intention to insult or disrespect the high institution.”She added: “I deeply regret and feel guilty for my actions.”The furore is the latest controversy to stain the Miss Universe contest, which has been striving to portray a more progressive image in the modern world. Last week Miss America, Sarah Rose Summers, also generated online fury in an Instagram Live post where she made light of the fact that Miss Vietnam and Miss Cambodia could not speak good English. Ms Summers apologised and said she “would never intend to hurt another.”Miss USA Sarah Rose Summer in her swimsuit during the Miss Universe 2018 preliminary round in BangkokMiss Philippines, Catriona Gray, who won the competition to the delight of her entire nation, faced her own internet backlash when she was accused of “romanticising” poverty. In answer to a question about the most important lesson she had learned in her life, she referred to her work in the slums of Manila, the Philippine capital.“I’ve always taught myself to look for the beauty in it, to look for the beauty in the faces of the children, and to be grateful. I would bring this aspect as a Miss Universe to see situations with a silver lining,” she said.Ann Van Wijgerden, a charity founder who has worked with Ms Gray, jumped to her defence, however, arguing that she was not guilty of “social pornography” by using her slum work to promote herself.   “The way that Catriona has worked with us, that’s not the case…Someone like Catriona coming and just physically being here, and just her smile is the deepest message that you have not been forgotten,” she told CNN Philippines. Please review our commenting policyWinter solstice: Why pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year (a day late) Brexit latest news: Sajid Javid refuses to say whether Government remains committed to driving net migration down to the tens of thousandsWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?Managed no deal: What exactly does it mean for Brexit - and what will happen?Prison guards send \u0026#34thank you\u0026#34 letters to well-behaved inmatesComment: The Government\u0026#39s strategy for combating sexual harassment falls well short of what is neededComment: We\u0026#39ve won the War on Terror, but Russia presents a rising new threatNicola Sturgeon makes second EU referendum her top Brexit target ahead of Theresa May talksComment: If Tory Leavers truly believe in Brexit, they must be willing to bring down this train-wreck governmentElon Musk unveils landmark tunnel in Los Angeles in bid to eliminate city trafficWomen told mammogram was a \u0026#39false positive\u0026#39 are twice as likely as those with negative result to end up with cancerNo more excuses: health chiefs vow to step up war on salt as targets to cut content missed Universities warned to curb \u0026#39spiralling\u0026#39 grade inflationTheresa May\u0026#39s flagship immigration policy hit by last-minute Cabinet rowBusiness watches political infighting \u0026#39in horror\u0026#39 with just 100 days to go until BrexitCashless revolution \u0026#39happening too fast\u0026#39 as millions of consumers face exclusion from shops and restaurantsExercise could be as good as drugs at cutting high blood pressure Mother of two appeals for release of husband held on drug charges in Bali The Long Song, episode 1 review: a pertinent, unexpectedly comic tale of slavery’s endGrizzly Bear Cubs and Me, review: the cute cubs didn\u0026#39t get the memo about this being a serious documentaryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2018/05/03/TELEMMGLPICT000162097837_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0ggGNY_A2dHyghdflyNWj5P8.jpeg?imwidth","title":"women told mammogram false positive twice likely negative result","story":"Research on more than 1 million women suggests cases defined as \u0026#39false positives\u0026#39 could be a clue to later diseaseWomen who experience a “false positive” result after a mammogram are twice as likely to end up developing cancer as those who get a negative result, research suggests.Every  year, thousands of women are given the “all-clear” after being told that apparent abnormalities are not malignant.But research on more than 1 million women suggests that such cases – normally defined as “false positives” – could actually be a clue to later disease.The study, led by Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute in Barcelona, tracked cases who underwent screening in Denmark, Norway and Spain, between 1991 and 2010.During the time 1.15 million women underwent 3.5 million mammograms, resulting in 10,600 cancers being detected. A further 5,700 cancers were detected in between screening.The research found that women with a “false positive” result – abnormalities, which were then found not to be malignant – had twice the chance of those with negative results to end up developing breast cancer.Such women remained at a higher risk for 12 years after receiving a false positive result, the study found.Scientists said the findings, published in the British Journal of Cancer, suggest that patients should be given “personalised” screening strategies based on their inidual risk - with more frequent mammograms for those who experienced a “false positive”.In cases where women had two false positives, the risk was four times that of those with a negative result.Experts said other studies suggest that as many as three in four women told their result was a false positive were wrongly classified in the first place, and should not have been given the all-clear.In other cases, mammographic abnormalities could be a risk marker indicating a higher chance of later disease, scientists said.Baroness Delyth Morgan, Chief Executive at Breast Cancer Now, said: “These could be really important findings. Further investigation is needed, but this study suggests that a ‘false positive’ result may be able to act as a marker for women who could benefit from more frequent screening.“Crucially, we’d urge women who have received a false positive not to worry unnecessarily about their risk of developingbreast cancer – but simply to attend screening when invited, check their breasts regularly and report any unusual changes to their GP.”She said it was important to note that the link did not show that false positives caused a higher risk of breast cancer, but could signal other factors which increase the chance of disease.“There could be a number of factors involved – for example, screening abnormalities could come as a result of women having a higher breast density, which is known to increase breast cancer risk,” she said .“Our risk of breast cancer can depend on a combination of our genes, family history, lifestyle, reproductive history andbreast density. While there is much more research to be done, we are hopeful that tailoring screening to a woman’s inidual risk could one day help detect more cases earlier, while enabling those at particularly low risk to avoid unnecessary screening,” she added.Georgina Hill, from Cancer Research UK, said: “While this large study showed that women given a false positive breast screening result were more likely to go on to develop breast cancer, the reasons behind this are unclear. It may be that women are more likely to notice breast changes after a false positive result, or there is something about these women’s breasts that makes their mammograms harder to read and puts them at an increased risk. But it’s important to remember that most women who are given a false positive result do not go on to develop breast cancer.”Winter solstice: Why pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year (a day late) Brexit latest news: Sajid Javid refuses to say whether Government remains committed to driving net migration down to the tens of thousandsWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?Managed no deal: What exactly does it mean for Brexit - and what will happen?Prison guards send \u0026#34thank you\u0026#34 letters to well-behaved inmatesComment: The Government\u0026#39s strategy for combating sexual harassment falls well short of what is neededThai internet star apologises over alleged criticism of Miss Universe gown designed by king\u0026#39s daughterComment: We\u0026#39ve won the War on Terror, but Russia presents a rising new threatNicola Sturgeon makes second EU referendum her top Brexit target ahead of Theresa May talksComment: If Tory Leavers truly believe in Brexit, they must be willing to bring down this train-wreck governmentElon Musk unveils landmark tunnel in Los Angeles in bid to eliminate city trafficNo more excuses: health chiefs vow to step up war on salt as targets to cut content missed Universities warned to curb \u0026#39spiralling\u0026#39 grade inflationTheresa May\u0026#39s flagship immigration policy hit by last-minute Cabinet rowBusiness watches political infighting \u0026#39in horror\u0026#39 with just 100 days to go until BrexitCashless revolution \u0026#39happening too fast\u0026#39 as millions of consumers face exclusion from shops and restaurantsExercise could be as good as drugs at cutting high blood pressure Mother of two appeals for release of husband held on drug charges in Bali The Long Song, episode 1 review: a pertinent, unexpectedly comic tale of slavery’s endGrizzly Bear Cubs and Me, review: the cute cubs didn\u0026#39t get the memo about this being a serious documentaryWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/27/16/rtx4bn3j.jpg","title":"big four accountancy firms cma proposals deloitte ey kpmg pwc","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

It would be funded by a mandatory levy on accounting firms.“We need to build a new house,” Mr Kingman told reporters.KPMG is on the accountancy naughty step again over Ted Baker auditThe new watchdog - the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority - would directly regulate auditors, be forward looking and draw a line under a creaky, leaky, ramshackle and “excessively consensual” FRC perceived to be too close to the Big Four, Mr Kingman said.The new watchdog would also have additional powers to pursue any company director if it found wrongdoing.FRC chief executive Stephen Haddrill has already said he would step down next year. The board of the new regulator would decide whether to keep on current FRC staff.Separately, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Tuesday published interim findings of its audit market review, which it began a few months ago.What would happen if the big four accountancy firms were broken up?Carillion: Will watchdogs now finally try to break up big auditors?Deloitte UK admits to substantial BAME gender pay gap “We propose that FTSE 350 audit should be carried out jointly by two firms, at least one of which should be from outside the Big Four,” the CMA said.The subsidiaries of a company would be ided up among the two auditors, with both approving the consolidated accounts.New laws would be needed to implement many of the Kingman recommendations and the CMA proposals, which will be finalised in early 2019.The business ministry welcomed the recommendations, but it may have to hold a public consultation. It faces a parliament clogged by Brexit and a new regulator is unlikely to emerge before 2020.Rachel Reeves, chair of parliament’s business committee, said a new regulator should be able to spot signs of corporate failure and step in before it was too late.“We will take a close eye to the CMA and Kingman recommendations and examine what needs to be done to deliver on these reports,” Ms Reeves said.European Union and British reforms introduced in the past two years to increase audit market competition ended up with companies switching between the Big Four rather than hiring smaller rivals like Grant Thornton or BDO.“These intractable problems may take some years to sort out,” said CMA chairman Andrew Tyrie. “If it turns out that the proposals are not far-reaching enough, the CMA will persist until the problems are addressed.”Mr Kingman said a new regulator would bring an end to current industry self-regulation through professional bodies like the ICAEW. FRC oversight of actuaries should be moved to the Bank of England, he said.In France, joint audits are already common and help smaller accountants like Mazars to break into the top end of the market. Joint audits are estimated to cost about 20 per cent more than having a single auditor.The CMA said if joint audits did not work, a possible alternative would to be ensure that some major audit contracts were only available to non-Big Four accountants - a step the industry proposed in the summer.The CMA stopped short of calling for a break-up of the Big Four but proposed putting their audit and advisory services into separate operating entities.An audit business would have its own board, staff and profit pool for bonuses so it can focus on quality book-keeping.Other recommendations include giving the new regulator powers to intervene in a firm’s audit, and a “duty of alert” that requires auditors to tell the regulator if they have serious concerns about a company’s viability.The CMA recommendations are open for public consultation until mid-January.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The remarkable surge in value was followed by a series of price crashes that saw bitcoin tumble by thousands of dollars in the space of just a few days, before a steady decline took hold of the market and forced the cryptocurrency down to today\u0027s price of just $3,400.If losses continue, the price collapse could be worse than any previously experienced by bitcoin.Today is an opportunity to look back at all the people who told you that this was going to be a new world, that you were missing out, or that you didn\u0027t understand the new paradigm taking place, and cut them out of your life, said Clement Thibault, a senior analyst at online financial platform Investing.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBitcoin holds a big promise of sovereign and sound money – the bubble we experienced a year ago was an unfortunate consequence of human greed and short term thinking.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearOther analysts say it is difficult to predict\u0026nbspwhether bitcoin will continue to fall, as the nascency\u0026nbspof the cryptocurrency industry means it is still adjusting to many different price factors.One year on from bitcoin’s all-time high, many are questioning how cryptoassets are valued, and whether they are a sensible investment, said Mati\u0026nbspGreen, a market analyst at online trading firm eToro.As a relatively new concept, cryptoassets are still finding their feet in terms of value. It’s important to remember that all assets, in every market, experience a process of price discovery, and that cryptos are no different. Given the rapid growth of the crypto industry in the past years, this process has been accelerated, but long-term investors should not be deterred.CoinMarketCap)Like many other analysts, Mr Green is quick to note that this is not the first cycle that bitcoin has experienced in its 10 year history.Five previous cycles saw bitcoin fall by an average of 85 per cent from its high before eventually recovering to a level above that high.Can Norwegian waterfalls stop bitcoin from destroying the planet?The latest price fall may seem dramatic due to the numbers involved but it still only represents an 83 per cent fall in value from its December 2017 price. But bitcoin only needs to fall by another $1,000 before the latest losses become record losses.\u0026nbspAs for a short 2019 outlook, I don\u0027t see Bitcoin reaching new highs in 2019, Mr Thibault said.I believe too many would-be early adopters got burnt badly last year, and once an asset has been labelled a bubble, a gamble, or a speculative investment, it takes time to rebuild the trust and appeal needed to push the asset forward.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Averse to exercise. You see him on the Vitality posters on the Underground. It’s a clever advertising ploy because the point is to get you to do more exercise. And the surprising thing – if you look more closely – is it’s all about insurance.It used to be you bought life or health insurance, stuck the paperwork in a drawer, and then forgot about it, until you got ill or they called for the priest. That has all changed – as Herschel Mayers, CEO of Vitality, explained to me. Born in Zimbabwe, he was brought up in Johannesburg, and ides his time between South Africa and London. After a few years with Liberty, Mayers co-founded Discovery Life, now the largest insurer in South Africa. He joined forces with Prudential in 2014 to set up Vitality. Now 58, he trained as an actuary, so he’s good at mathematics and statistics and probabilities and improbabilities. But stick with me here, because he is also good at making it simple. Personal confession: many moons ago I turned down the opportunity to go about selling insurance because I thought of it as too doom-laden and didn’t want to scare the pants off people (“You know you’re going to die, don’t you? Stop kidding yourself, you’d better be prepared!”).The genius of Herschel Mayers lies in changing the narrative. He has spun insurance around 180 degrees and turned it away from being about dying or getting ill and made it all about keeping fit and well and living longer. He made me feel healthier just talking to him. A View from the Top: ViaVan London chief Jess Oppetit A View from the Top: SlimFast boss Lindsay Reisser-WestonHouzz CEO Adi Tatarko on running a $4bn internet startup A View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techVitality has a so-called “wellness philosophy”, but this isn’t as hazy and airy-fairy as it sounds. You know all those good intentions you blithely announce around New Year and then it all goes to pot until the next round of solemn promises? Mr Mayers doesn’t want you to revert to couch potato. “Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you and exercise is good,” says Mayers. The interesting question he asks is, “How do you get people to change their behaviour for the better?” His answer is more carrot than stick – or, as it is now known, “behavioural economics”. This is how it works: you sign up to Vitality. Vitality straight off the bat gives you a 40 per cent discount, providing you agree to go to the gym regularly. And they give you juicy little incentives along the way if you stick by your commitment – free cinema tickets, coffee at Starbucks, an Amazon Prime subscription. The benevolent Mr Mayers is, in effect, paying you to keep hitting the cross-trainer or doing your 10,000 steps every day. The more steps, the less smoking, the better the incentive. Conversely, your discount is “eroded” over time if you slack and go back to your bad old ways. Can’t I just phone in or email to say how good I’ve been? Mayers has anticipated my would-be cunning deception. “That’s why we give you an ‘activity tracker’. We monitor your good behaviour.” So you actually have to clock in at the gym. They know if your heartbeat goes up or not. “It has to be verifiable,” says Mayers. So don’t think you can just sneak outside and have a quick fag. Such is the joy of social media. “We have daily interaction.”But, I can’t help wondering, isn’t that a bit tyrannical? \u0026nbsp“It would be, if we were forcing you,” says Mayers, reasonably enough. “But we’re not forcing you, it’s your choice to buy into the system in the first place. You don’t have to do it. But it makes more sense.” The logic of the deal is the “shared value model”, developed originally by Professor Michael E Porter at Harvard, a theory Mayers has translated into practice. The Vitality customer or “member” is given a subtle (or not so subtle) “nudge” in the direction of staying in better nick for longer. The value, or benefit, is shared by both the insured – who gets to enjoy life more, both quantitatively and qualitatively – and the insurer, who pays out less on claims. Everyone is a winner, including the nation as a whole, which gets one more useful and productive citizen to add to the GDP, and the NHS, which has one less chronically ill patient to look after for years on end. “By changing behaviour,” says Mayers, “we want to create additional economic value.” Call me a nanny-state guy if you will, but, realistically, when you’re up against the proliferation of cardiac-inducing fast food and fried chicken outlets, you need to do something to try and level the playing field. It’s not exactly King Canute trying to hold back the tide, it’s more Canute, or in this case Vitality, providing everyone (or at least the million or so members of the club) with surfboards to skim across the waves rather than just sit there on your backside getting swamped. “We are making a difference,” says Mayers. “People do go for check-ups and our claims are lower.” The Harvard-inspired theory is working so well that Mayers has now extended it into the realm of investing or saving. You know that other good intention you have, to put a bit aside from your wages for your retirement? And you know how it would be better to start sooner rather than later, ideally in your twenties? “Everyone knows this, but they don’t do it,” says Mayers. Well, guess who is going to give you a gentle nudge in that general direction? Vitality’s persuader in this case is a 20 per cent bonus at the end of it, when you collect your pension payout – providing you’ve behaved well and haven’t started too late or withdrawn it all too soon. Makes sense to me, so much so I suggested it to my two twenty-something sons. They scoffed (as is their wont). “But they are offering all these incentives,” I said. “Maybe they could consider paying off our student debt then,” they said.A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It would be funded by a mandatory levy on accounting firms.“We need to build a new house,” Mr Kingman told reporters.KPMG is on the accountancy naughty step again over Ted Baker auditThe new watchdog - the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority - would directly regulate auditors, be forward looking and draw a line under a creaky, leaky, ramshackle and “excessively consensual” FRC perceived to be too close to the Big Four, Mr Kingman said.The new watchdog would also have additional powers to pursue any company director if it found wrongdoing.FRC chief executive Stephen Haddrill has already said he would step down next year. The board of the new regulator would decide whether to keep on current FRC staff.Separately, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Tuesday published interim findings of its audit market review, which it began a few months ago.What would happen if the big four accountancy firms were broken up?Carillion: Will watchdogs now finally try to break up big auditors?Deloitte UK admits to substantial BAME gender pay gap “We propose that FTSE 350 audit should be carried out jointly by two firms, at least one of which should be from outside the Big Four,” the CMA said.The subsidiaries of a company would be ided up among the two auditors, with both approving the consolidated accounts.New laws would be needed to implement many of the Kingman recommendations and the CMA proposals, which will be finalised in early 2019.The business ministry welcomed the recommendations, but it may have to hold a public consultation. It faces a parliament clogged by Brexit and a new regulator is unlikely to emerge before 2020.Rachel Reeves, chair of parliament’s business committee, said a new regulator should be able to spot signs of corporate failure and step in before it was too late.“We will take a close eye to the CMA and Kingman recommendations and examine what needs to be done to deliver on these reports,” Ms Reeves said.European Union and British reforms introduced in the past two years to increase audit market competition ended up with companies switching between the Big Four rather than hiring smaller rivals like Grant Thornton or BDO.“These intractable problems may take some years to sort out,” said CMA chairman Andrew Tyrie. “If it turns out that the proposals are not far-reaching enough, the CMA will persist until the problems are addressed.”Mr Kingman said a new regulator would bring an end to current industry self-regulation through professional bodies like the ICAEW. FRC oversight of actuaries should be moved to the Bank of England, he said.In France, joint audits are already common and help smaller accountants like Mazars to break into the top end of the market. Joint audits are estimated to cost about 20 per cent more than having a single auditor.The CMA said if joint audits did not work, a possible alternative would to be ensure that some major audit contracts were only available to non-Big Four accountants - a step the industry proposed in the summer.The CMA stopped short of calling for a break-up of the Big Four but proposed putting their audit and advisory services into separate operating entities.An audit business would have its own board, staff and profit pool for bonuses so it can focus on quality book-keeping.Other recommendations include giving the new regulator powers to intervene in a firm’s audit, and a “duty of alert” that requires auditors to tell the regulator if they have serious concerns about a company’s viability.The CMA recommendations are open for public consultation until mid-January.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This includes the prestigious Royal Academy of Music and the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama.The report, which focuses on 148 universities and other higher education providers, also finds that graduates who entered higher education with the equivalent of grades CCD or below at A-level were almost three times more likely to graduate with first-class honours in 2016-17 than in 2010-11.\u0026nbspMore than three-quarters (78 per cent) of first and upper second-class degrees were awarded in 2016-17, compared to 67 per cent just six years before. And the percentage of first-class degrees has risen from 16 per cent to 27 per cent, the report finds.\u0026nbspNicola Dandridge, chief executive of the OfS, said: “It is fundamentally important – for students, graduates and employers – that degrees hold their value over time.“This report shows starkly that there has been significant and unexplained grade inflation since 2010-11. This spiralling grade inflation risks undermining public confidence in our higher education system.”Government unveils plan to tackle ‘grade inflation’ at UK universitiesStudents ‘should sit national exams to stop grade inflation’Number of first class degrees soars sparking grade inflation warningShe added: “We absolutely recognise how hard students work for their degrees, and accept that improved teaching and student support, and increases in the qualifications students gain before university, could explain some of the increase in grades.\u0026nbsp“However, even accounting for prior attainment and student demographics we still find significant unexplained grade inflation. The sector must quickly get to grips with this issue.”\u0026nbspMs Dandridge warned that the regulator would use its powers against universities if they did not work together to solve the problem. They could be issued with sanctions and fines, and in the most extreme cases, universities could be deregistered.\u0026nbspEducation secretary Damian Hinds said: “I am urging universities to tackle this serious issue and have asked the OfS to deal firmly with any institution found to be unreasonably inflating grades.”\u0026nbspThe minister added: “Students across the country work hard for their results and they deserve a grading system that properly recognises this.“We want and expect to see results improve over time, but the scale of this increase in firsts and 2:1s cannot be proportionate to improving standards.“I sincerely hope today’s figures act as a wake-up call to the sector – especially those universities which are now exposed as having significant unexplained increases. Institutions should be accountable for maintaining the value of the degrees they award.”Nick Hillman, from the Higher Education Policy Institute\u0026nbspthinktank, said: “Clearly there has been a real issue with grade inflation and the incentives, such as league table positioning, to push through higher grades are so strong that only collective action is likely to prove successful.”Last month, university bosses admitted that a continued rise in the number of top degrees could undermine confidence in the value of a degree, making them less useful for students and employers. \u0026nbspThe report by Universities UK, GuildHE and QAA, the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, recognised that increased competition to attract students has incentivised universities to perform well in league tables – which rate institutions on the number of top degrees awarded.\u0026nbspA UK-wide consultation has been launched to look at how the value of degrees can be protected.\u0026nbspAlistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: “Universities are already taking steps to tackle grade inflation.\u0026nbsp“The report we recently published outlines a number of measures to protect the value of qualifications over time that are currently being consulted on by the UK Standing Committee for Quality Assessment.\u0026nbsp“It is essential that the public has full confidence in the value of a degree.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jose Mourinho after he was sacked by Manchester United with immediate effect.

And thus did Charles Dickens become the man who invented Christmas as we know it today.\u0026nbspThe great Dickens scholar FG\u0026nbspKitton said so in an essay in 1903, and the great Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens proved it to be true by starring in the 2017 film The Man Who Invented Christmas.Charles Dickens: The man who invented Christmas plagiarised JesusAnd yet, bah, humbug and damn those pesky experts: lots of them disagree.\u0026nbspIndeed, no less an authority than the US university-based Dickens Project now advises: “It is the smart thing to say that Dickens was the man who “invented” Christmas. Show you are smarter by disputing it.” A Christmas Carol\u0026nbspcomplete with John Leech\u0027s illustration of Mr Fezziwig\u0027s ball\u0026nbspIt is true that industrialisation meant fewer people were exposed to the rural squirearchy’s habit of opening their doors to the lower orders and staging grand Christmas celebrations – of the kind seen at Crewe Hall in Cheshire, where Dickens’ grandfather had been the butler, or in the pages of A Christmas Carol, where The Ghost of Christmas Past reminds Scrooge of how much he had enjoyed the dances organised by old Fezziwig.But in 1843, outside the ranks of the aristocracy and aspirant upper middle-class imitators, Christmas was alive and well.\u0026nbspPrevious attempts to kill it had, after all, foundered on the stubborn resistance of “Merrie England”.Puritan MPs may have ordered December 25 to be kept as a fast day in 1644, to avoid giving “liberty to carnal and sensual delights”.\u0026nbspAnd Oliver Cromwell may be famous as the man who banned Christmas.\u0026nbspBut the “rude multitude” broke the head of the major who tried to enforce the “Ordinance for abolishing holy-days” in Canterbury in 1647, and by 1656 MPs meeting in parliament, on Christmas Day, were reduced to wailing: “The people keep up these superstitious observances to your face … We are returning to Popery.”Created with Sketch.15 Christmas films to watch on Netflix  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (“Home Alone”, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.

After A Christmas Carol, people become obsessed with celebrating Christmas.“Before, there were people who were, like Scrooge’s nephew, doing their own family Christmases, but after, suddenly everyone is thinking: ‘We should be doing that.\u0026nbspWhy haven’t we got people coming round and playing blind man’s buff?’“It all starts to get much bigger.”Newspapers began to notice the establishment of “plum pudding clubs” to help less well-heeled Victorians meet the cost of their Christmas dinner, so they too, like the Cratchit family, could hear “the pudding singing in the copper”.\u0026nbspOther clubs helped them buy a goose, maybe even a “prize turkey” as big as the boy asked to fetch it by the reformed Scrooge.And, says Ms Hawksley, fewer employers wanted to look like the unreformed Scrooge: “It became fashionable for people to expect that they could have time off at Christmas.”Nor did Dickens stop at A Christmas Carol.\u0026nbspHe wrote four more Christmas books.\u0026nbspThen in 1850 he brought out the first “Christmas Number” of his newly created magazine Household Words, working with other writers to pack it with stories for the consumption of “the teeming millions”, as Reverend JH\u0026nbspMorgan called the intended readership of the two-penny weekly.He became, as the Morning Chronicle put it, “the chief literary master of the ceremonies for Christmas”.But, Ms Hawksley\u0026nbspemphasises, when he started it all with A Christmas Carol, Dickens had been seeking to do far more than simply become a sidekick to Father Christmas.\u0026nbsp“It was done as a protest,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “Christmas Carol was written from the heart, from Dickens feeling a desperate need to create change.”Gustave ​​Doré (Alamy)These were the “hungry Forties”, a decade when Britain was in the grip of economic depression, when harvests failed and food prices were rising beyond the reach of many on low incomes.\u0026nbspIn May 1843 Dickens had railed against the wealthy attendees of a City of London charity dinner, calling them “sleek, slobbering, bow-paunched, overfed, apoplectic, snorting cattle”.\u0026nbspThey offered a stark contrast to the poverty he was encountering with ever greater frequency on his customary long walks through London.Then in October Dickens was invited to give a fundraising speech at the Athenaeum in Manchester.\u0026nbspThis was the same Manchester where Friedrich Engels was beavering away at what would be published as The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844.\u0026nbspEngels sought to shame the Victorian manufacturing class by documenting the “the misery and grime which form the complement of their wealth”.\u0026nbspHe told of workers living in overcrowded slums complete with “foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement”, forced by “barbarous” employers to “work 30 to 40 hours at a stretch”, with child factory hands dying or being reduced to “a crowd of cripples” before they could reach adulthood.\u0026nbspHe wrote A Christmas Carol in just six weeks.\u0026nbsp“He saw galloping poverty,” explains Ms Hawksley, “And a government doing nothing about it.\u0026nbspHe couldn’t let it continue.\u0026nbspHe was desperate to do something.”Into the mouth of Scrooge, Dickens inserted what, in his Manchester speech, he had called the “cruel absurdities” of the age.\u0026nbspTo the charitable gentleman seeking alms for the poor, Scrooge offers only a reference to the treadmill of the workhouse, which was about the only official social security option then available.When the gentleman suggests the poor would rather die than enter the workhouse, Scrooge answers: “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”The remark comes to haunt Scrooge once the ghosts start arriving, but it wasn’t far off what many thought about the poor being an unconscionable drain on the finite resources of a population that could not keep expanding forever.\u0026nbspIn most of his books, Dickens wanted to shame his readers into doing something,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “What he wants people to realise is that every single person is, like Scrooge, responsible for the poor they are ignoring.“The point about Scrooge’s conversion is not that he buys the most expensive turkey.\u0026nbspIt’s that the turkey will feed a family.“For Dickens, it’s not about diamonds, or going out and buying a load of plastic crap like people do at Christmas today.\u0026nbspIt’s about the fact that buying decent food and giving Bob Cratchit a salary increase will save Tiny Tim from dying.”Nowhere, says Ms Hawksley, is the central message of A Christmas Carol more clearly stated than when the Ghost of Christmas Present shows Scrooge two emaciated children, a boy named Ignorance and a girl called Want.\u0026nbsp“Beware of them both,” the spirit tells Scrooge –\u0026nbspand the reader.\u0026nbsp “But most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.”“Dickens was saying,” explains Ms Hawksley, “that if you let Ignorance and Want grow up like that, they will become the Bill Sykes, the cruel and violent adults, of the future.“Ignorance and Want are, in Dickens’ mind, about the most important characters in the book, the whole message, the whole point of it.”Alston: Poverty UK\u0027s \u0027biggest challenge\u0027 and\u0026nbspMPs are in \u0027state of denial\u0027 about itWhat frustrates her more, however, is that 175 years after Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol, Britain remains blighted by the kind of poverty he was hoping to eradicate.“Dickens was writing about this in 1843,” she says.\u0026nbsp“How in 2018 can we have the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty talking about child poverty in the UK?\u0026nbspHow can there be so many homeless people on the streets of London?“How can I be hearing news stories that Christmas 2018 will be a so-called “bumper year” for the numbers of children suffering in cold houses because people can’t afford to heat their homes?\u0026nbspThere is absolutely no excuse for it when today we have so much more in terms of money, housing and knowledge of sanitation.”How London is living a modern day Christmas CarolWhat does Christmas Carol still mean to us?In the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, after “crying his eyes out” over A Christmas Carol, the author Robert Louis Stevenson, wrote enviously: “Oh, what a jolly thing it is for a man to have written books like these and just filled people’s hearts with pity.”In the 21st century, Dickens\u0027 great-great-great granddaughter is grimly ambivalent about how the work continues to generate similar reactions.\u0026nbsp“Every year,” says Ms Hawksley, “I meet people who have read A Christmas Carol for the first time, who say, ‘I can’t believe how good it is, how it still resonates.’“That’s wonderful in terms of Dickens’ writing, but depressing in terms of society.\u0026nbspIt frustrates me that A Christmas Carol is still so deeply relevant.\u0026nbspIt bothers me that 175 years after Dickens was writing about the children Ignorance and Want, we still have so much child poverty.”“And that,” she says, “Is what would make Dickens spin in his grave.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to

That comes as a free game that is available to players who subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online, which now requires a fee.New version of Nintendo Switch could come next year, report claimsLast year, Nintendo unveiled that it would revive the NES Classic – making many more them after they had initially quickly sold out. That gave hope to fans who longed for the consoles to stick around, and for new games or consoles to be released as well.But Mr\u0026nbspFils-Aime\u0026nbspsaid that the existing two consoles represent extent of our classic program. That suggests there will be no extra consoles, such as the Nintendo 64, which fans have continuously asked Nintendo to reduce into its own miniature system and rumours had suggested may be on its way.And he also ruled out new additions to the Classic consoles\u0027 line-up of games. There\u0027s no ability for add-on content with our classic consoles, so when you purchase the console it’s coming with that set roster of content, he said.But he did point out that new games have been added to the Switch\u0027s set of NES games, suggesting more might come through that service.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse.

To be blunt, there is no sign of that happening.On Tuesday, the Netherlands produced a nice example of the way Brexit has gone down in other European countries. Prime minister Mark Rutte, usually thought of as a friend of the UK, took out a full-page newspaper advert warning his people to pay attention to the “chaos” over the North Sea in Britain. Far from setting an example for other breakaway states to follow, Britain’s withdrawal is a cautionary tale to\u0026nbspthe continent – where the narrative is one of a once-respected nation making a fool of itself.Even the most rebellious EU member states, led by right-wing populists, are not planning to leave. When the Hungarian foreign minister was asked on British radio recently whether his country would consider leaving the EU – given its constant skirmishes with Brussels – he simply\u0026nbspsaid no. Neither is the issue on the agenda in Italy, where far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini is, if anything, driving EU policy on migrants, rather than retreating from the union.There are suspicions that many of these\u0026nbspnew wave populist politicians do secretly want to leave – but dare not say so publicly because it is a politically unpopular position. This in itself underlines just how far outside the mainstream support for exiting the bloc has become.Polling from across the continent is emphatic. In Denmark, usually seen as the second most Eurosceptic member state after the UK, voters would stay by 55 per cent to 27 per cent,\u0026nbspa 28 per cent gap in favour of the EU, according to broadcaster DR. This represents a substantial swing away from Euroscepticism since polling\u0026nbspin\u0026nbsp2016, undertaken\u0026nbspbefore Britain’s own vote.Government to step up no-deal Brexit plans with £2bn in extra fundingPerhaps the most staggering numbers are even closer to home. Some Brexiteers have suggested “Irexit” – Ireland leaving the EU – as a solution to the border problem which has dogged\u0026nbspwithdrawal negotiations. There is almost nothing on this earth less likely to happen: the latest poll by Red C shows a full 92 per cent of the Irish population wanting to stay in the EU, with just 7\u0026nbspper cent voting for exit and 1 per cent saying they did not know either way. In Dublin the figure in favour of membership hits an almost implausible 96 per cent.There will be all sorts of factors behind these numbers as well as Britain’s example: the abatement of the euro crisis and of the migration crisis will have played a role. One explanation that is popular in Brussels is that the unity of the remaining EU27 in negotiating Brexit has actually brought them closer together – uniting them behind a common foe (or “partner”, as they would publicly refer to the UK).It’s worth bearing in mind that Brexit hasn’t happened yet –\u0026nbspif the UK somehow ends up prospering outside the bloc, perhaps other countries will start to get itchy feet. But they don’t like the look of what they’ve seen so far.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted on Tuesday that “there is no such thing as a ‘managed no-deal’”.The business groups’ statement, released overnight, came as ministers stepped up their £2bn contingency plans for a no-deal scenario including placing 3,500 military personnel on standby to support the government.After Ms May was forced to delay the meaningful vote on her withdrawal agreement until mid-January her cabinet agreed on Tuesday that no-deal planning should proceed\u0026nbsp”in full”.

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Downing Street said that advice on no-deal preparations would\u0026nbspalso be going out to households by various channels over the coming weeks.The Treasury will supply an additional £2bn on top of the £2bn already provided, with the Home Office receiving £500m for border security and handling the settlement scheme for EU nationals who want to remain in the country.Another £400m will go to Defra, the environment department, for projects including ensuring clean drinking water, which the UK treats with chemicals and gases imported from the EU.The Department for\u0026nbspInternational Trade, which would need to accelerate efforts to replicate dozens of agreements between the EU and countries such as Japan, Mexico and South Korea, is expected to receive around £130m to recruit more trade negotiators.Ms May returned from a European Council summit in Brussels, where she failed to secure enough assurances to make her proposed withdrawal deal viable. Her\u0026nbspplan still looks\u0026nbsplike it will be defeated when put to a Commons vote in the new year.\u0026nbspAnnouncing the effort to step up no-deal preparations,\u0026nbspMs May’s\u0026nbspspokesperson\u0026nbspsaid she still believes she could win changes to the deal.He added: “Cabinet agreed that, with just over three months until we exit from the European Union, we have now reached the point where we need to ramp up these preparations.”Jenny Chapman MP, Labour’s shadow Brexit minister, said the move “is testament to the prime minister’s failure” in negotiations, which would now cost the government billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money.She said: “A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for jobs, the economy and the border in Northern Ireland.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As other leaders said, she was very ­specic about the legally binding text she needed to convince the DUP and her backbenchers to approve the deal.The two-day meeting was actually scuppered by an agreement suddenly being trashed by Ireland and France.Do they have any inkling how much goodwill between our nations they have destroyed with their parlour games over the past ½ years  How many once pro-EU Brits they convert into Leavers with every new salvo Do they not grasp how mistrustful, obstructive and even hostile we would become as an EU member , God forbid, Remain won a second referendum Senior Cabinet ministers including Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt are rightly imploring Mrs May to focus every effort on No Deal preparations. A “managed No Deal” to soften the impact after March  looks a decent idea to us.The Sun always wanted a deal. It’s not going to happen. The EU has other ideas.And a second referendum, or “Norway Plus”, both amount to craven surrenders to this bloated organisation which ­apparently ­relishes belittling Britain. We must get out.TONY Blair is a delusional egomaniac who has damaged Britain more than any politician we can recall.It was his negligence and naivety over dodgy intelligence that condemned  of our troops and countless Iraqis to their deaths during the  invasion.It was his decision to unleash a vast, uncontrolled influx of migrants on a country ill-equipped for it . . . all, as his adviser later admitted, to “rub the Right’s nose in ersity”.It was his lust for wealth after leaving office that saw him torch what was left of his reputation and line his pockets with dictators’ millions.Now Blair is hell-bent on setting a match to our democracy itself as he heads the campaign to reverse the biggest mandate in its history, sabotaging our Brexit negotiating position in the process.And so the trail of destruction he has left for  years goes on. The common thread being his unassailable conviction, despite every single catastrophic mistake, that Tony always knows best.Many of us stopped listening long ago.

That would not have changedshe lost and the Tories picked a new leader.And whatever Jeremy Corbyn says, it wouldn’t changethere was an election and he moved into Number  either.You can’t rule anything out for certain, but most MPs reckon an election is the most unlikely outcome of all.That’s why calling a vote of confidence in the government is a waste of time. Tory MPs won’t risk it and the Ulster Unionists know they will never be more powerful.Anyway, Jeremy told Labour MPs to trigger Article  and set the clock ticking down to departure in March. There isn’t time for an election, the public expect MPs to sort it out and there’s no guarantee it would solve the problem.I asked Jeremy this week what his policy would bethere was an election: would he campaign to stay in, promise another referendum or, after campaigning against the EU for decades, uphold the referendum - but he refused to give any answer at all.And who can be certain he’d win  He should be miles ahead in the polls, but when asked who would make the best Prime Minister, the public still back Theresa May. In fact, in a two-horse race, he comes a distant third behind don’t know.Jeremy seems to think he could negotiate to stay in the single market and customs union, but stop paying our contributions and still have a say over the rules. Who thinks we could get all the benefits without paying a penny Imagine asking to use a gym but refusing to join or even pay – and wanting a say in how it’s run!Let’s face facts: the EU isn’t waiting to give a dferent Prime Minister a better deal. Whether it’s Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn, they won’t roll over and give us everything we want.It’s not only Theresa May who says it. Nor even just Juncker. Merkel says the deal can’t be changed.Macron and Ireland’s Taoiseach say so too. Not one EU leader said they are open to renegotiating it.In , % of Labour constituencies voted for Brexit. Labour heartlands like Sunderland, Hartlepool, Bolsover, Wakefield or Doncaster all voted leave. Here in the West Midlands, people voted to leave in some of the highest numbers of all.In , our manesto promised to uphold the referendum – no s, no buts, no second referendum.Ordinary, decent people who voted leave believed us. Lots of people voted leave to make politicians sit up and listen.With trust in politics at an all-time low, we can’t discount that lightly. Another referendum would take months and there’s no agreement on what the questions would be.I’ve listened to lots of people in Dudley and there’s not much evidence people have changed their minds. Eventhey had, who thinks a narrow remain vote would settle it That’s why I think our choice is between Theresa May’s deal or leaving with no deal at all. I joined the Labour Party to fight for ordinary people and their jobs must come first.This week I met Jaguar Land Rover, a world-beating British company employing , British workers.Like manufacturers up and down the country they believe a no deal Brexit would threaten their business and the jobs of people who depend on it.Delays at ports will cost jobs. Thousands of parts go into every car – some cross the channel several times before the car is complete.They all have to arrive at plants in the Midlands or on Merseyside at exactly the right moment and in the right order. Half the parts for cars made in Britain typically come from Europe.It would be greatthey were made here, but that can’t happen quickly. Worse, the supply chain that has grown up here in the last decade could decide to leavewe get the wrong deal.Leaving on WTO terms would also put people out of work too because tarfs would increase the price of cars built in Britain and sold in Europe by ten per cent.Theresa May’s deal isn’t perfect but is still our best option in front of us to protect jobs, keep employment and environmental standards, deliver a fair immigration system and safeguard border arrangements in Ireland.For all its flaws, the Brexit deal meets these priorities.It commits to maintain ‘high standards of free and fair trade and workers’ rights, consumer and environmental protection’, and a level playing-field on regulations.And it ensures that there is no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.There will never be a perfect deal. Butwe want to avoid trust in politics being damaged even more, andwe want to protect jobs and standards, we must think long and hard before rejecting the only deal on offer.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’ve faced much bigger challenges in our history.”It was a shrewd move by the ambitious Foreign Secretary.  Leaving the EU without a deal has suddenly become a hot favourite with Brexit leadership rivals. It is also the outcome feared most in the capitals of Europe.The German official’s response is shocking proof that Theresa May’s mantra: “No Deal is better than a Bad Deal” was always seen as an empty bluff.It also refutes the claim that her widely-loathed withdrawal plan is the only option available from Brussels. Mr Hunt brushed aside Project Fear’s portrayal of a “Car Crash” Brexit and insisted Britain can cope with all challenges.“We shouldn’t pretend there won’t be disruption,” he admitted. “That’s why as a responsible government we have to make all the preparations necessary.”Far from the clf-edge, car-crash nightmare painted by the Treasury, BBC and CBI, a clean Brexit is entirely manageable. It would set us free to trade on terms set by the Government in the interests of the British people.We would save the £billion ransom to Brussels — and use some of the cash to buy time from the EU for more detailed planning. And it would see off slippery Tony Blair’s treacherous call for a second referendum.Yes, there would be turbulence as the UK adjusted to ending  years of EU membership.  But experts such as ex-Bank of England governor Mervyn King predict we will look back on this moment and barely see a blip on our economic growth chart.Indeed, economists believe Britain will thrive and prosper once free from EU shackles. So why are Remainer MPs so implacably determined to stop it  Why are they reneging on their own manesto pledges and threatening to overturn the legislation which set the March deadline Simple. Once we are out, we are out for ever. We can prove we are a great world economy, trading to every corner of the globe — Europe included. We would never rejoin the cosy exclusive club beloved of the political elite, unelected bigwigs and business fat cats who ride the Brussels gravy train.Only  per cent of UK goods — one eighth — goes to Europe, with the rest heading for the wider world or home markets.The EU share of world trade is on the slide. Game-changing technology is alien to its socialist outlook. Where, for instance, is the EU equivalent of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon or Google Brussels turns its face against progress — allegedly because it threatens jobs. Yet Eurozone unemployment is double Britain’s and criminally high among young people.Remainers claim under-s are fans of the EU and would vote Remain in a second referendum. Labour is trying to cash in by cutting the voting age from  to . Yet a revealing new poll suggests the youth of Britain and Europe sees right through the EU drive for a political and economic superstate.Given the choice, they pick free markets, low tax and low regulation over the suffocatingly interventionist Grand Project. These tech-savvy youngsters can see Europe is trailing behind while unimaginable opportunities from robot technology and Articial Intelligence unfold.Britain would miss out too, barred by EU regulation,we tied ourselves indefinitely to this inward-looking protectionist bloc. A Full Brexit might cause a few short- term hiccups for just-in-time deliveries, but they will be quickly forgotten as decades of opportunity are opened up by Brexit.UKplc has nothing to fear but Project Fear itself. Warnings of economic chaos, mass unemployment and house price crashes have repeatedly proved to be .The same scare stories were peddled by the same people who  years ago predicted Britain would sink unless we joined the European single currency. We never looked back. It is the Eurozone that is now sinking, with Greece already under water. Britain’s jobs miracle is the envy of EuropeThe Eurozone is mired in a crisis inflicted by uncontrolled mass immigration and youth alienation.  The most patriotic Frenchman couldn’t claim Paris is nice at this time of the year. By contrast Britain is a hive of activity, with steady growth, booming exports and a jobs miracle which is the envy of Europe.The UK is a magnet to the EU’s unemployed and to foreign investment worth billions from tech giants such as Apple, Amazon and Google — despite Brexit.Leaving without a deal on March  is our best chance of implementing the  referendum and escaping from a teetering, corrupt and arrogant political fantasy before it implodes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord.

W. Bush would have been briefed on the extra-terrestrial presence to whatever extent he so desired.There is no clear evidence George H. W. Bush wanted Disclosure. That said, it is my view the military intelligence complex would have been quite comfortable with Disclosure taking place during a second term of President George H. W. Bush.He would have been the ideal Disclosure President from their perspective. The Cold War was over and the door was now open to end a very expensive and complex truth embargo.While director of the CIA, Bush is said to have even blocked former president Jimmy Carters attempts to obtain UFO information during an alleged briefing on November , .Bush told the president-elect he didnt have the need to know buthe wanted information he should ask the Congressional Research Serviceto prepare a briefing for the new administration.Carter had pledged he would disclose to US citizens what the government knew about UFOselected after witnessing a strange light while governor of Georgia in .Bassett, the executive director of UFO campaign group Paradigm Research Group, thinks Bush rebuffed Carter as he knew some UFOs were extra-terrestrial in origin.He said: We do know the newly elected President Carter approached CIA Director Bush regarding a study the White House wished to initiate regarding the extra-terrestrial issue.Bush declined to cooperate and referred him to another agency. This may have guaranteed he would not be able to stay on as CIA Director - or not.Carter fired him shortly thereafter. One might ask, If there was no truth to the extra-terrestrial hypothesis, why would Bush disrespect a presidential request While campaigning with his son Jeb Bush in the s, Bush was asked about UFOs by a journalist. He replied: Americans cant handle the truth.Bush was also quizzed by UFO researcher Charles Huffer during a presidential rally trip to Rogers, Arkansas, in  during which he asked Bush: Will you tell the people the truth about UFOs Bush replied: Yeah.we can find it, what it is. We are really interested. When pressed further Bush replied: I know some. I know a fair amount.Bush also supported space exploration, and was once quoted in a speech as saying: We will travel to neighbouring stars, to new worlds, to discover the unknown.Bassett, who organised the Citizens Hearings in  - which saw dozens of military, government and intelligence officers give evidence about UFOs to six former members of Congress - believes Bush was also aware of the infamous Roswell UFO crash in July .He added: It is my view Bush was quite knowledgeable about the history of the extra-terrestrial presence to the extent he required. Did that include the July  Roswell events  Almost certainly yes.Last year Bushs son George appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live show to plug his autobiography but remained tight-lipped when asked about UFOs.Kimmel said: This is a question I think is very important to me and very important to the country.When you were in office - and I dont know when this ever orit happened - did you go through the secret files, the UFO documents  BecauseI was president that would be the first thing I did.But instead of laughing off the question or branding Kimmel a crackpot, the former US leader replied: Maybe.He then went on to reveal his daughters Barbara and Jenna asked him the same question when he served as the rd President of the United States but he couldnt tell them anything.Bush was one of three former presidents and presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, to go on Kimmel to discuss the UFO topic.Barack Obama, Hillary and Bill Clinton have all previously spoken out about UFOs on the show.Hillary vowed to launch a probeshe made it to the White House but she was pipped by Donald Trump.And Hillary’s campaign manager John Podesta, Bill’s former Chief of Staff, has called for the lid to be lted on UFOs.In , he tweeted his biggest regret after leaving his job as President Obama’s advisor was “once again not securing the #disclosure of the UFO files.”President Trump recently announced plans to launch a US Space Force by  - some insiders believe it is in response to a hostile alien threat. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was baffled.The previous Wednesday I had heard a strange noise as I was stood by a cafe at the edge of the loch in Fort Augustus.The noise sounded almost metallic, but like something was blowing air - like Darth Vader.I have swum and sailed with whales and dolphins, seen hundreds of seals, and it sounded like nothing I have ever heard.I spun around and saw something grey, just a side of a body and a flipper.Then last Thursday after my tour party went on their cruise I decided to take a walk along the river Oich, mainly to see the old bridge, and was taking a few pictures of the loch and the scenery when I again heard that curious noise.I looked up from my phone and saw a long, straight neck, all completely grey, and a narrow face, which was only about ft away and then it turned and disappeared all in a few seconds.I looked down and realised that it was in my picture, so zoomed in and there it was.It actually looks like a giant bird or a peacock in the face, with high ridges above its eyes and what almost looks like a beak.Nobody has yet proved that the Loch Ness Monster is real – but that certainly hasn’t stopped people trying.Many pictures claiming to show Nessie have been exposed as pranks, with others explained away as a case of mistaken identity.The surgeons photograph, snapped by Colonel Robert Wilson in , is probably the most famous Nessie sighting ever. It was later exposed to be a hoax.Wilsons snap ignited curiosity around the Loch Ness Monster and led to a spate of sightings, such as this picture taken from Fort Augustus on the lochs southern tip.George Edwards took this stunning picture of Loch Ness in , claiming that he had finally found definitive proof of the giant creatures existence.A year later, the boat skipper admitted he had made the whole thing up.The image was created with a fake fibreglass model of Nessie from a National Geographic documentary, and Edwards had even let many of the tourists he ferries around the loch in on his prank.In , a satellite photo on the Apple Maps app seemingly showed a ft shape swimming in the loch.The mysterious outline sparked renewed interest in Nessie after a lull of several years, with the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club claiming it was likely to be the camera-shy monster.However, experts insisted it was merely a boat and its wake.In September , amateur photographer Ian Bremner took this photo from the banks of the loch.His friends claimed it showed three seals playing together, but the whisky warehouse worker suggested it could be Nessie.I know dinosaurs came from birds and that many had hard lips, almost like a beak - but this is simply what I saw.It seems to have almost a frill on its neck. It is very odd.All I will say is that,I was going to fake a Nessie, I would certainly have made it look less like a bird and more like... well, more like what we think Nessie looks like!The image was today accepted by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register.The previous sightin was recorded by an American tourist who saw a dark green object protruding . feet above the water on November .According to Google there are , searches each month for the Loch Ness Monster, which is estimated to be worth £million to the region."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457019997.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"indonesian boys remarkable weight transformation","story":"Liverpool FC fan Arya Permana – who once tipped the scales at  stone lbs – has been celebrating the ability to “walk and play football”.Donning a massive t-shirt to show his staggering weight loss, the -year-old has been sharing his weight loss journey on Instagram, where mates have praised him for his “extraordinary” determination.The youngster baffled doctors three years ago when footage of him as a morbidly obese child playing in a water tank to cool his body emerged from the small village of Cipurwasari in Indonesias West Java province.Indonesian media explained that since then, the lad has undergone a gastric bypass to help lose weight.He has also followed a strict diet and undertaken rigorous exercise, walking three miles every day and playing badminton with his friends.Commenting on his remarkable transformation after losing st lbs an elated Arya said: Now I am happy, I can walk. I can play as well.I have become more agile than before. I like playing football too.I can walk km with my friends and every afternoon I play football with them.”The lad explained that he wants “to be a professional footballer. My favourite football club is Liverpool FC and my favourite player is [Brazilian] Roberto Firmino. I want to play like him.He was born at home via natural birth and weighed a normal lbs, but began to pack on the pounds at an abnormal weight from the age of two.Arya’s parents took him to several doctors in their village, but surprisingly, doctors did not find anything abnormal about his alarming weight gain.The couple even had to borrow money from their neighbours and relatives to feed their ever-hungry child as their meagre monthly salary of £ wasnt enough to buy sufficient food for Arya.At nine years of age, Arya was so big that he couldnt attend classes as walking to the school was an uphill task for him.His ever-growing giant frame meant no clothes fitted him, so he had to spend his days draped in a sarong and sitting inside a tiny pool to cool himself down.His massive diet became an even bigger worry for his parents, mum Rokayah Somantri, , and dad Ade Somantri, , as he ate five times a day.The little boy could chomp through enough rice, fish curry, beef, vegetable soup and Tempeh - a traditional soy patty - to feed two adults for a whole day.His helpless parents were so worried they put him on a strict no-sugar diet to control him from further bloating.After undergoing bariatric surgery in April last year, the operation helped him initially reduce his weight from st to st in just three weeks.And thanks to a dieticians advice and a fruit and veg-laden diet, Arya has been steadily losing weight and aims to hit his target weight of st.Dad-of-two and farmer Ade said: We have been giving him the food that doctors have recommended.We dont give him prohibited foods. He is not allowed to eat sweets or sweet drinks. He is strictly off sugar.Arya is now very active and plays with his friends. He even goes for a walk with his friends.His sleeping habits have also improved. Earlier he would complain of shortness of breath and troubles sleeping but now he has sound sleeps.Arya has also learnt to ride a motorbike.However, he only takes it out occasionally as he is too young to ride it.Ade explained: Arya can ride a motorcycle now. He is preparing for junior high school but the school is very far away from our home – about  km – and there is no public transport, so he will ride a motorbike to school.In the past Arya used to be best in the class but then his studies were interrupted [because of the weight-related problems].I am glad that Arya is going to school like an ordinary child. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I hope you are well wherever you are Im sending you positive energy.Im having an amazing day today, super happy, simply because holidays have just started.But I wanted to take a second to send a message to people back in the UK, but also to people in Stevenage where I grew up.Its somewhere Im incredibly proud of coming from and still love to this day.The sports star continued to excuse himself for his remark on stage urging people allowing his comment to get up in their feelings, to, throw it to the side, its negative energy, you dont need to hold.He continued Im super proud of where Ive come from and I hope that you know that I represent in the best way I can always.Particularly when youre up in front of a crowd trying to find the right words to express the long journey that youve had in le, then I chose the wrong words.Hamilton signed off his video saying: I didnt mean anything by it and those of you who know me know that I always mean love so God bless you, have a great day.The five time Formula  champion was slammed by his home town after referring to it as “the slums” at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards.Hamilton, who finished second in Sunday’s public vote behind Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas, made the comment about Stevenage during an on-stage interview.He had just been named among the nominees for the main prize at SPOTY when he told presenter Gabby Logan: Its been a really long journey, a dream for us all, as a family, to do something dferent, to get out of the slums.Well, we would say its not the slums, but just come out from somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very high but we did it as a team.The former Peartree Junior School and John Henry Newman School pupil lived on Peartree Way before moving to Ayr Close and then a six-bedroom detached house in Woodfield Road with dad Anthony.Former neighbours of the sports star today told the Sun Online they were disgusted by the comments.Peter Fuller, , who used to live near the racing driver on Peartree Way, said: I was disgusted. Absolutely disgusted.Ive lived here for  years so I knew him when he was growing up.Hes been back here. Hes been to the local school so why make a comment like that  I think it was totally out of order.Ive never said a bad word about him before, he was just a typical boy growing up but to get up there and say that. Why make a statement like that We all know each other around here. We all look out for each other.It was totally out of order. Its undeserved. We deserve an apology.Nigel Ballard, , added: Its easy to say when you are living in Monaco. He shouldnt forget his roots.Eve Sewell, , said: I remember him coming over to play in the garden and being cheeky but he was nice with it. He had a lovely smile. You couldnt be angry at him.I think it is possibly the way he thinks about it now.Trevor Lugmayer, , a company director, is now in the house Hamilton used to live at in Woodfield Road.He said: “The people round here are laughing. This is a nice area.Every town has its bad parts but this is the original old town.I think he should apologise for calling this a slum.He lived here when he got signed to McLaren.I was here when they put the plaque up. I was in the process of buying the house at the time when it went up. It got lost when we had building work done on the house.I was always rooting for him. People here were really proud of him.He was an ambassador for the local area and I think hes made a big, big mistake.A university lecturer, , who used to live on the same road as the sports star, told the Sun Online: It was a s new build estate, I was about , he was around nine or ten.This has been bugging me for a while because his rhetoric has been going on since he joined Formula One.He says hes from the slums of Stevenage but Ive always known that the road [Ayr Close] he lived on with his Dad, Anthony, was s new build detached, so its not slums at all.So Stevenage may not be the most glamorous of places but it certainly isnt a slum and the bit he lived in was probably one of the nicest bits of town.The former neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, added: I think people need to understand where theyre from and where they grow up has an influence on your le and to be disparaging like that is probably rude to the people he went to school with, he lived with, that are still in the town but maybe dont have a multi-million pound le.The whole estate was probably built in the early s and that whole area on the edge of Stevenage was developed in the s s - its  per cent detached houses with drives and garages, its not the s new town. Its the nicer section of the town.And the school he went to as well, John Henry Newman, was the only partially selective school in town because it was Catholic and they were very strict about that, whereas the rest of the town was comprehensives. So he lived in the nicest bit in town and went to the only selective school.Its not growing up in a slum is it Sharon Taylor, the leader of Stevenage borough council said it was “disappointing” and people felt “very offended” by what Hamilton had said.Ms Taylor, who has been appointed OBE for her work in local government, wrote on Twitter: Disappointing that @LewisHamilton chose to use this event to make negative comments about his home town. Nowhere is perfect but we’ll go high  say we are #ProudofStevenage.Catherine Hennessy tweeted: Im from Stevenage. Lived  doors away from Lewis Hamilton until he moved away to live with his Dad. NOT a slum. I am very offended about that.Gobi Ranganathan, England para-badminton player, tweeted how he was “proud to fly the flag for #Stevenage”, adding: It’s not perfect, but it’s home. And it has a lot to offerpeople just open their eyes.Councillor Howard Burrell told the Sun Online: Lewis doesnt like Stevenage anymore.Were not a slum. I find it disappointing because he had to grow up somewhere and be born somewhere, but Im a charitable bloke and these things happen.Stevenage, which is about  miles north of London, became the UKs first New Town in  and property prices in the growing town are just above the national average.Britains richest sportsman, Hamilton was born and raised in the town, where he went to school with Manchester United left-back Ashley Young, and started go-karting there when he was six.In a previous interview the racing driver claimed he was hungrier for the Formula  drivers title than rival Nico Rosberg because he was from a not great place in Stevenage and lived on a couch in his dads house.He said: Nico grew up in Monaco with jets and boats and all these kind of things, so the hunger is dferent.Hamilton relocated to Switzerland in  and then Monaco in  - moves he has since admitted were at least partly motivated by tax reasons.In fact, his tax arrangements have been criticised by members of parliament among others, and last year he was named in a leak of confidential documents as allegedly having benefited from a tax-avoidance scheme involving a private jet.He was also forced to apologise for a social media post in which he appeared to criticise his nephew for wearing a princess dress at Christmas.Hamilton, the most successful British driver in F history, subsequently apologised for the comment and took his nephew, who was wearing a dress, to Disneyland Paris.Apart from the Stevenage slip, Hamilton won praise on Sunday for his part in paying tribute to Billy Monger, the -year-old who won the Helen Rollason Award for ing to motorsport this year  months after losing both of his legs in a horror crash at Donington Park.He was previously crowned Sports Personality of the Year winner in .Britains richest sportsman has not responded to a request for comment or tried to clary his remarks on his own social media channels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I want them to respond like Harry Kane. Talent can take you so far. Good luck may occasionally give you the rub of the green. But it is perseverance and dedication, bravery and commitment that will enable you to reach your goals.”The Education Secretary will next year launch the School Sport Action Plan, which aims to make sure all children get a chance to try competitive sport and find one that they enjoy.Like many of you, I watched the Sports Personality of the Year competition on Sunday evening. It really brought home what an amazing year this has been for sport – from Geraint Jones winning the Tour de France, to the last-second goal in the Commonwealth Games netball final.But with all of the highs winning brings, we all know the crushing disappointment when you lose. This summer the country collectively experienced both extremes during the England football team’s World Cup journey.Much was said about the Coach of the Year winner, Gareth Southgate’s approach to supporting the young England team through the pressure that the World Cup put on them.Rather than dferent playing formations, it was the work the team were doing on mental resilience that caught the headlines.Geraint Jones showed the same kind of mental toughness when he told himself to ‘chill out a bit’ when he had a wobble on the penultimate stage of the Tour de France.It is this character and resilience that I want our young people to develop when they are at school – so whether they go on to an international sporting career or a more regular job, they can deal with the ups and downs of le.Some people believe that children should be wrapped in cotton wool, protected from some of the harsher realities of le for as long as possible. I don’t agree. Failure and disappointment aren’t necessarily a bad thing - we’ll all face them at some point in our lives. It’s how you cope with them that counts.I call these the four pillars of character: they are believing in yourself and not giving in to self doubt the motivation to work for long-term goals bouncing back from knocks and sticking with the task in hand, come what may.There is a lot we can learn from the sporting world here. Sport can help us all dream big and achieve more. It can teach us how to win gracefully and lose with dignity.This is why I am making competitive sport in school a priority so young people can develop these skills. Today I am talking to the governing bodies of all the major sports and other providers, like the Youth Sport Trust, about what they can do to make sure more young people have the opportunity to play competitive sport.This comes ahead of our School Sport Action Plan next year which will look to make sure all children get the chance to try competitive sport and find one that they enjoy and can stick with.Competitive sport instils the kind of self belief that enabled an -year-old Harry Kane to overcome the humiliation of being dumped by Arsenal’s youth team. Kane’s response to not winning Sports Personality of the Year on Sunday night was to say “hopefully in the years to come I can try and win it”.One day my children will fail at something that truly matters to them – I don’t want them to give up and go home, I want them to respond like Harry Kane.Talent can take you so far.

And some reality TV stars set a good example, just as some of our more traditional public figures leave a lot to be desired.It seemed to me that Love Island winners Jack and Dani were quite a moral couple. They acted with integrity, which is a really good message for young people.But contrast this with US President Donald Trump — I’ve spoken to girls in an assembly about lewd com-ments he has made and how they fit with his role of Leader of the Free World.More recently, we’ve seen Harry Redknapp triumph in I’m A Celebrity — and he came across as a loving, loyal man who represents an image of masculinity that sometimes we don’t see.So never mind politicians,you want to present an argument for decency, sometimes you’re better off getting a healthy dose of reality TV.THE incoming head of the Girls’ Schools Association, Sue Hincks, says reality TV stars are better role models for schoolchildren than politicians.Is she right  As evidence she offered ’s Love Island and I’m A Celebrity.It’s true that this year’s winners — Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham in Love Island, and Harry Redknapp in I’m A Celeb — were adorable.But it’s easy to look brave when you are wearing a helmet full of insects, especiallyyour background is in musical theatre, like campmate John Barrowman.I’d try to remember I was comparing reality TV stars to Donald Trump, who, though incidentally President of the United States and a politician, is still, and always will be, a reality TV star. He just has more cameras these days.But then I look at the current state of British politicians and it’s hard not to agree with Hincks.At least on reality TV the contestants try to disguise their moral failings, becausethey didn’t, no one would vote for them.This isn’t a problem for politicians, because on any given day the other side are behaving worse.I long for the calm wisdom of ’Arry and the open-hearted kindness of Dani — I’m sure she would be fine, with a strong Cabinet secretary behind her, telling her the dference between the deficit and the debt. Perhaps the new crop of “wholesome” reality TV stars is a response to our politicians, a cry of the heart from the electorate: “We just want someone kind!”Look at Boris Johnson, and his new haircut for the leadership contest that never came. What did he tell his barber  “Don’t make me look like a flatulent, floppy-haired former public schoolboy” When did anyone last call BJ kind Or at David Davis, who pitched for the Tory leadership in  with the catchphrase “It’s DD for me”. That’s not a campaign slogan, it’s a bra cup size.Look at the younger Tories, seething with ambition, bungee jumping over the corpses of rivals with lattes in their hands.The horrible irony is, they would bite their own fingers off for a chance to appear on Strictly Come Dancing.On the other side we have a Labour leadership juddering with cowardice, longing for a hard Brexit — while lying about it — and a swt General Election, like the bourgeois Trots they are. If it’s bad for the people, it’s good for them. Yuk.So Hincks isn’t wrong to make a comparison which even five years ago would have seemed obscene.Can it be that reality TV stars are the best of us, and reality TV is now more authentic than actual real le If true — and it seems to be — things are bad indeed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

exactly  days to go until exit day, Theresa May’s senior ministers agreed to trigger the Government’s emergency plans “in full”.The dramatic move is a bid to heap pressure on the EU to give in to the PM’s fresh pleas to improve the draft Brexit deal so MPs agree to vote for it.More than  back up plans - drawn up over the last two years - are now being implemented, including the urgent despatch of , emails to businesses who export to the EU.The public were also warned to look out for fresh Government instructions soon about potential travel delays to Europe that could create Easter holiday chaos.As the No Deal war footing decision raised Brexit tensions in Westminster yet further yesterdayAnd No said the Government’s emergency civil contingencies committee will meet to monitor the work, under the codename Operation Yellowhammer.Revealing the landmark Cabinet decision, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said no deal work will now become “an operational priority within government”.Mr Barclay said: “The Government’s priority is to secure a deal, that hasn’t changed.“A responsible Government needs to ensure that we are ready for that default option which we don’t want to happen.“At Cabinet today we agreed that preparing for No Deal will be an operational priority within Government.“We will see that tempo increase in the coming weeks.”As The Sun revealed, Mr Barclay also rammed home the message to business to trigger their own no deal plans immediately as “much more of a priority”.Fears are growing that only a small percentage of UK firms are ready for the emergency optionHe implored: “We need to get over to business that this is something they need to prepare for, as it is a matter of  weeks until we leave the European Union.”But there was also anger among business bosses that ministers are refusing to offer the nation’s six million firms – most of them small – any cash help or tax breaks to plan.While sparking delight among Tory Brexiteers, the dramatic announcements immediately ignited a fresh revolt from Tory moderates.Former business minister Nick Boles threatened to try to bring down his own Government to stop Britain leaving the EU without a deal.Tory MP for Grantham Mr Boles tweeted: “I owe my constituents and my colleagues total clarity about my position.“If at any point between now and  March the government were to announce that ‘no deal’ Brexit had become its policy, I would immediately resign the Conservative whip and vote in any way necessary to stop it from happening.”During a tense three hour Cabinet meeting in No to authorise the new footing, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd also implored her colleagues never to implement the no deal plan.In a signal she may resign before carrying out the nuclear option, Tory leadership hopeful Ms Rudd told the table: “Just because you put a seat belt on doesn’t mean you should crash the car”.She also urged other senior ministers to consider job losses in their constituencies under no deal as well as win support from Labour MPs to ensure a smooth Brexit, insisting its time “to put country before politics”.But Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt hit back to insist he was concerned that the EU had picked up on Cabinet members’ “noises off”.Instead, he told the whole table they must look united around the no deal threat to send “a strong signal” to Brussels to climb down and agree to Theresa May’s deal compromises.Former Tory Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith insisted the Cabinet action will turn the screw on the EU, telling Sky News: “What they need to understand is that the UK has a plan to leave should they not agree a deal”.Justice Secretary David Gauke became the first Cabinet minister to say he would resign rather than back a no deal policy, and the PM’s own de facto deputy David Lidington has issued the same threat in private.Speaking out, the UK five business groups beg the Commons’  MPs to halt a no deal as they insist “the future course of our economy will be in their hands”.The bosses of the British Chambers of Commerce, the Confederation of British Industry manufacturers’ organisation EEF, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Institute of Directors say: ““Businesses have been watching in horror as politicians have focused on factional disputes rather than practical steps that business needs to move forward.“The lack of progress in Westminster means that the risk of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit is rising.“The suggestion that ‘no-deal’ can be ‘managed’ is not a credible proposition.”Mr Hammond doled out the next tranche of no deal spending.The extra cash – for   – totals £ billion and will help  government departments ramp up their preparations for crashing out of the EU without a deal in March.Money has been prioritised for new border and customs operations and gearing up UK trade policy.The five departments getting the biggest cash injections are the Home Office with £ million, £ million to Michael Gove’s Environment, Food and Rural Affairs brief, £ million to HMRC, £ million to the Business Department and £ million to International Trade.The additional money takes the total spent on Brexit preparations since  to £. billion.The Chancellor said last night: “The PM’s deal is the only way to deliver on the referendum while protecting jobs, businesses and prosperity.I’ve worked with departments so they have the resources to prepare as we leave the European Union, including our borders, trade policies and support for businesses.But a responsible government prepares for all contingencies and that is why we’re stepping up no deal planning.”The European parliament’s chief Brexit negotiator also slammed the Foreign Secretary for talking up the prospect of a no deal Brexit.MEP and former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt said: “Those, like Jeremy Hunt, who glory a no-deal Brexit are totally irresponsible.“There is no such thing as a ‘managed no-deal.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed he has become the world’s biggest fridge buyer as ministers ramp up no deal Brexit preparations.The NHS boss is snapping up , cooler units so he can stockpile six weeks of medicines.Mr Hancock told BBC Newsnight: “I’ve become the largest buyer of fridges in the world. I didn’t expect that”.He added: “We’ve instituted full no deal planning within the NHS already, and I would like to see the whole of government going to that position because it’s the responsible thing to do”.A total of £million is being spent to help the Department of Health store drugs and medical supplies in warehouses.The money can’t be clawed backBritain does leave the EU with a deal.When he was first appointed to the Cabinet earlier this year, Mr Hancock declared he was also now the legal owner of the world’s largest collection of fax machines thanks to the NHS’s outdated practices. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is quite extraordinary”.But hitting back, sources close to Mr Hammond last night insisted the ministers were wrong as the Treasury doesn’t oversee spending once the cash is doled out to departments.No deal cash requests are sometimes turned down but only when ministers are trying it on, the source added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Insiders last night admitted the new visa regime would only likely be “phased in” from .No. had insisted the £, threshold was included –to force business to train up young Brits.Philip Hammond was bitterly opposed – along with Business Secretary Greg Clark. One Cabinet source told The Sun: “Almost everyone is siding with the Chancellor.”Home Secretary Sajid Javid will today promise the new immigration system will end preferential treatment for EU nationals – and instead base a visa regime on what migrants from around the world can “contribute” to Britain.The Sun can reveal he will also say foreign workers will only be able to access Britain’s full benefit system after they have spent FIVE YEARS in the UK.In other measures:Sources last night claimed the PM’s commitment to reducing net migration to the “tens of thousands” would not be mentioned.But the White Paper does reiterate the Government’s goal to reduce net migration to sustainable levels – and reference its  Manesto commitment to bring numbers down.In a statement released late last night, Mr Javid said: “We are delivering on the clear instruction to get control over our borders and bring in a new system that works in the interest of the British people.“It will be a single, skills-based immigration system built around the talent and expertise people can bring, rather than where they come from.”An independent committee in September recommended Theresa May use Brexit to open Britain to the “brightest and the best” but signicantly restrict access for low-skilled workers.Experts claim there are four million Brits who want to work more hours but cannot because of sky-high EU migration over the past decade.A Cabinet Minister last month said the PM was in a “minority of one” in trying to halt low-skilled immigration.The Sun on Monday revealed low-skilled migrants would lose residency rights or bring family members with them after Brexit.An ally of the Chancellor last night said: “It is wholly untrue to suggest that Treasury is blocking this process.“The Chancellor is very clear that freedom of movement is ending and it is important for the country that we have a policy that works for every industry.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bob, for sure. The sponge with the Bob and the shorts ”At which point, things started getting even weirder for Gino on Michael McIntyre’s Big Show.A programme which, I realise, wasn’t the main television event of the weekend. That was the Strictly Come Dancing final.But so what  It’s Christmas, and after  months largely spent telling you what television shows I don’t like, it seems only fair to celebrate one that I do. Why Simple. Michael McIntyre is one of the very few comedians left on television who realises it’s his duty to make viewers laugh rather than bend and bully them into their left-wing point of view.A noble calling, obviously, but there’d be no point taking this mainstream approachthe resulting show was also cheesy, unprofessional and talked down to its audience.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show falls into none of those traps. Apart from being riotously funny, it’s also clever, charmingly savage at times and ided into three equally slick segments that can all carry an embarrassing musical interlude from Cheryl Tweedy, who stamped around, in elephant leggings, like a mad woman on Saturday’s show.They take it in turns to be the highlight of the show as well. A fortnight ago Bradley Walsh’s send-to-all stunt was the best bit.Last week it was the unexpected-star-of-the-show slot and, at the weekend, it was undoubtedly the Midnight Gameshow with Gino, who had eight stabs before sort of nailing: “SpongeBob with the square pants.”His torment was only just beginning, however, as he was then asked to ID the mystery celebrity singing in his shower.Easy in normal circumstances, but, right on cue, Gino had developed a: “First thing in the morning moment”, and had to shuffle next door with a pillow hiding his embarrassment.If he had the problem, though, Michael McIntyre definitely had the solution.“It’s Sinitta!” he yelled, killing the “first thing in the morning” problem stone dead, which was probably just as well, because he was hugging Boycie from Only Fools And Horses a second or two later.It wasn’t just Gino’s physical responses that were the making of this stunt, though, it was the fact that, having been presented with all this random madness, as well as a goat called Olivia, he asked the single best television question I’ve heard all year.“Are we live ”“LIVE ” responded McIntyre, barely able to contain himself. “It’s one in the morning, Gino.”It’s tempting, then, to describe the whole thing as television perfection.Perfection, though, would’ve involved Gino asking, as he did: “Who comes to houses at this time of the evening ” and McIntyre opening his bedroom cupboard door with a “TA-DA! Paul Young does, Gino.”A Dominatrix on C’s The Sex Business: Pain For Pleasure B Head of Drama at the BBC THE BBC really has created a Sports Personality Of The Year show in the image of its co-host Clare Balding and her all-consuming inferiority complex, hasn’t it A vast and murky event that clearly thinks it’s an adorable, all-inclusive, finger-on-the-pulse, rock ’n’ roll jamboree but is actually a nerdy, uptight, controlling, gender-obsessed, PC quota-thon of the most self-deceiving kind.So Tyson Fury, who has a genuine personality, was excluded from the final six, but Billie Jean King was all over proceedings and England’s Common-wealth Games netball women were apparently the “team of the year”.SPOTY was at its absolute worst, though, trying to do populist, celebrating the all-conquering England World Cup football team , with some BBC-approved patriotism.That is to say, a multi-cultural version of Three Lions, featuring Bhangra dancers, a steel band and a gospel choir, without whom, the BBC presumably imagined, England fans would be goose-stepping round the NEC burning crosses.No one can say for surethis ill-judged segment influenced the final vote, won by Welsh cyclist Geraint Thomas, of course, but Harry Kane started the night as favourite and ended it third, after something  happened during the song that was so horrendous and disturbing no one who heard the incident can ever mention it or the offender ever again.I hope you’re bloody proud of yourself, David Baddiel.The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote the Keats poem Ode To A Nightingale ”Joe Lycett: “Which American state is home to the Dallas Cowboys ”And  to , Sandi Toksvig: “What five-letter word for a native of one of the Scandinavian countries is also a British name for a root vegetable similar to a turnip ”GOOD Morning Britain, Tuesday Piers Morgan: “The lady who brings our food in has announced she’s quitting.

We should cut business taxes to boost them as they transition, and offset the cost from the poundbillion the UK would have paid the EU. It comes as Home Secretary Sajid Javid prepares to unveil plans for immigration policy after Brexit. The Home Office said details of the new system, which will mark the end of free movement from other European Union countries, will be set out in an immigration white paper.   The plans will include a new visa route for skilled workers and no cap for high-skilled professions such as doctors and engineers. Concern about the long-term social and economic impact of immigration helped drive Britains  vote to leave the EU after large numbers of people, especially from poorer member states in eastern Europe, moved here to live and work. It will be a single, skills-based immigration system built around the talent and expertise people can bring, rather than where they come from - maximising the benefits of immigration and demonstrating the UK is open for business, Javid will say.

But the President still had no idea who he was. The Foreign Secretary told the story during his speech at the Foreign Offices Christmas Reception, held last night at Lancaster House. Dozens of ambassadors and diplomats from across the world gathered in the gilded halls to enjoy fine wine and canapes and listen to the Foreign Office choir sing Christmas Carols. In his speech, Mr Hunt joked that Trumps visit to the UK, which took place in his first week in the job, had been quite an eventful visit.  He said: The day before I met him I was asked to do some media interviews with the American media. So I did an interview with Fox media in which I thought about things that I agreed with the President on and I trotted them out. And afterwards my Foreign Office media minder said to me “Foreign Secretary, you might just want to be a bit careful, because a lot of British people look at Fox, and they don’t always agree with the President.” Anyway, the next morning at Chequers, I met the President, and he bounded in and said: “Great interview!” And then he said “I said to the person next to me, I don’t know who this guy is…” And I learned thatyou want to get a message to the President of the United States, Fox is the way.  Donald Trump has grown infamous for spending long periods of time alone in the White House residence, watching cable news and tweeting angrily in response to what he sees. During the interview with Fox News, broadcast as part of host Martha Maccallums programme The Story, Mr Hunt lavished praise on Trump, saying he was a strong President and a dealmaker. He said: Well, I think President Trump has a certain style. I mean, this is someone who likes doing deals and part of doing a deal is to show people thatyou do the deal that he wants, thats very attractive. Hell be your friend,you dont do the deal, thats a very unattractive, les going to get tough. Mr Hunt also shared an optimistic view of Britains future outside the EU in his speech last night, saying: Whatever shade of Brexit we end up with, this country is always going to be the closest of friends with our European neighbours.

Mr Javids comments prompted a row as a No source insisted the target remained in place. But his remarks appear to confirm reports there is no mention of the target in the governments immigration White Paper - finally published today to outline plans for after Brexit.   The White Paper has been repeatedly delayed amid Cabinet rows and was finally scheduled for publication last night. Yet ministers have failed to decide on isive plans for a pound, minimum earnings threshold for new immigrants after a Cabinet row. Instead they will consult on the details with the business world and make a decision in the future. Mr Javid was askedthe document contained the , target by BBC interviewer John Humphrys. He replied: Theres no specic target. What we have set out is it will be a system that will bring net migration down to more sustainable levels.   Accused of abandoning the Tory manesto pledge, Mr Javid insisted: Were not abandoning any pledge. In our manesto we committed ourselves to bringing net migration down to sustainable levels. Pressed on the fact the Tory manesto committed to cutting net migration below tens of thousands, he said: Well I think in the manesto we said it was an ambition. But that is untrue. The Tories  manesto said: It is our objective to reduce immigration to sustainable levels, by which we mean annual net migration in the tens of thousands. Askedthe target remained party and government policy, a No source said: Its in the manesto. Yes.   Mr Javid insisted we remain committed to our manesto, adding: We remain committed to our objective of bringing net migration down. But he repeatedly refused to back the tens of thousands pledge specically. He said: Our objective is clear, its about bringing net migration down, the current levels are unsustainable. Asked for roughly the ninth time, he replied: I think Ive been clear, Ive been very clear on this. The full migration plan will be released as Mr Javid makes a statement to Parliament at .pm.

Mr Javid will publish the much-delayed White Paper on the proposals, which the Government says will mark the end of free movement. Under the blueprint, there will be a new visa route for skilled workers and no cap on high-skilled professions such as doctors and engineers. Mr Javid said: We are delivering on the clear instruction to get control over our borders and will bring in a new system that works in the interest of the British people. It will be a single, skills-basedimmigrationsystem built around the talent and expertise people can bring, rather than where they come from - maximising the benefits ofimmigrationand demonstrating the UK is open for business. The document is also expected to include details of the approach to low-skilled workers. It has been reported they may be able to apply for short-term visas of up to a year.   There have also been reports that the proposals could include a minimum salary requirement of pound, for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas. Diane Abbott MP, Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary, said: “The Government has disgracefully labelled workers on less than pound, as low-skilled. Our economy and public services are kept ticking by this majority of workers. “The Government is not, as it wrongly claims, using a skills-based criteria to meet the needs of our economy and our society. It is using an income-based system which allows derivatives traders free movement but which excludes nurses, social care workers and other professions in which we have severe skills or labour shortages. “The Tories are, once again, using crude anti-migrant rhetoric to try to cover up for their abject failure of managing the economy and the Brexit negotiations.” Confirming that the White Paper will be published following suggestions it may be further delayed, the Home Office said the UK will have full control over who comes here, with everyone needing permission before they arrive. This will enable employers to have access to the skills they need from around the world, while ensuring net migration is reduced to sustainable levels, the department added. The newimmigrationand borders system will be implemented in a phased approach from , following the post-exit transition period. On Thursday, anImmigrationand Social Security CoordinationBill will be presented in the House of Commons. As well as measures to end free movement, it creates the legal framework for a future, single benefits system that will apply to both EU and non-EU nationals. The White Paper was initially due to be published more than a year ago, but it was held back while the independent Migration Advisory Committeecarried out a detailed analysis. The MACs report, published in September, concluded that the new system should make it easier for higher-skilled workers to come to the country.   It recommended ministers scrap an annual cap of , on the number of visas available under the Tier  skilled work scheme, and open up the route to medium-skilled jobs. But it said access to Britains jobs market should be restricted for lower-skilled migrants. There will be focus on whether the Tory target of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands is mentioned in the blueprint. The target, which has never been met, has been championed by Theresa May. Mr Javid has backed bringing net migration down to sustainable levels but has steered clear of explicitly backing the tens of thousands figure. Estimated net long-term international migration to the UK - the dference between the numbers arriving and leaving for at least  months - was , in the year to June. While EU net migration has fallen, sparking claims of a Brexodus, the latest figures showed non-EU net migration was at the highest level since .

Millions of over-s may have to fork out pound. to watch shytelevision after the Government handed over funding for the leline to the BBC, despite pledging not to scrap it. It is feared the corporation will not be able to afford the annual poundmillion bill. But the Mirror found at least  Tory MPs have charged taxpayers pound,. in a year to buy licences for their constituency office TVs. National Pensioners Convention general secretary Jan Shortt said: “It’s unbelievable that these MPs were happy to pass the buck to the BBC to take away the TV licences from our most vulnerable people, but were happy to claim it for themselves.   “Such blatant hypocrisy will leave millions of pensioners fuming. “Clearly it’s one rule for them and another for the rest of us.” Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams added: “One in four of older people view the television as their main form of companionship. It is a shyleline. It was inappropriate for the Government to sht responsibility for this benefit on to our national shybroadcaster, with no public debate.” Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright billed the public for a licence three weeks before last year’s election, as Attorney General. His shypredecessor in the culture job, Karen Brad-ley, and Esther McVey were among Tories claiming the fee.   They acted within the rules and MPs of other parties got the perk.

The Independent shyParliamentary Standards Authority said: “MPs can claim for a TV licence for their constituency office.” Mr Wright’s spokesman said his TV licence was “a shylegitimate business expense.” A shyspokeswoman for Mrs Bradley added: “The TV licence is for use in her constituency office.” "},{"url":null,"title":"charles dickens festive story christmas","story":"NewsCharles Dickens festive story A Christmas Carol is  years old today years since the day Charles Dickens first had his novella ‘A Christmas Carol’ published.ShareCommentsByAdam Jacot de Boinod:,  DEC NewsOne of the most popular renderings of A Christmas Carol featured the Muppets\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser. It begins with him being “a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner” but a visit from the ghost of his former business partner, turns him into a mellower, gentler and more generous character. ‘A Christmas Carol’ was intended as a moral tale. Dickens wanted it to reflect the attitudes of the day towards poverty and in particular, child poverty. Its popularity grew from his instinctive tapping into what had become, by mid-Victorian times, a revival of the festive season. He put his own humanitarian mark upon the holiday and even popularised the phrase “Merry Christmas” among the Victorian public.   The interest in celebrating the Christmas season had been growing across the Victorian era. In the early th century it was associated with rural, peasant jollities, but increasingly it took hold of the imaginations of those in cities and industrial towns. Indeed much of what we now observe in our Christmas is the consequence of this mid-Victorian re-evaluation of former traditions. In , the first Christmas card was printed in England for Sir Henry Cole.   In  Tom Smith thought he would place toys and novelties instead of sweets inside the twisted wrapping to what we now know as the Christmas cracker. There was a revival of interest in Christmas carols and the Christmas tree was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. And Father Christmas previously was concerned with adult feasting and had no connection with children. He didn’t come down the chimney and hand out presents until well into the Victorian era. Santa’s reindeer however were naturally Scandinavian.   And it’s true that the continent was first to recognise our traditional festive formalities. Martin Luther, the Protestant reformer, was the first to add lighted candles to the tree. He was so taken with the Christmas night sky that he wished to bring “the lights of the stars” into the home of his family. As for carols, they were first introduced to formal church services by none other than St. Francis of Assisi. Baubles were invented in Germany and St Nicholas seems to come from Turkey. Nowadays Trafalgar Square has a Norwegian tree and certainly the continent boasts the most impressive of Christmas markets. This book has come over time to inspire our traditional Christmas, with notions of the family gathering, the food and drink, the dancing, the games and a festive generosity of spirit. The story has been adapted many times for film, stage and opera. In the s, Scrooge was sometimes seen as a unsettled figure wrestling with his past.

This sht towards greener, more energy efficient cars means there will also be a sht in energy demand – from traditional \u2028fossil fuels to grid electricity. This affects everything, from the price of power to the environmental impact of car charging. Britain’s energy infrastructure will also need to be smarter to ensure that it can meet the challenges of millions of people using electric vehicles. Britain is already on a mission to revolutionise the consumer’s relationship with energy, with the smart meter rollout. Smart metering will support the electric vehicle revolution by affecting when energy is used, as well as how much is needed.  Smart meters also pave the way for new energy tarfs which will reward drivers with cheaper powerthey charge off-peak. They could also enable EV owners to be even more environmentally friendly, by matching charging with the greenest electricity on the system. Purchases of pure electric vehicles , such as the Nissan Leaf or Tesla Model S, look set to increase as environmentally-aware consumers change their purchasing habits. Industry analysts think that environmental concerns are behind the fact that diesel registrations dropped by a quarter in May . Fast chargers  EVs emit no tailpipe emissions, meaning less air pollution in towns and cities. They can be charged at home or at a public charging point and ‘fast chargers’ can now be found in most petrol stations and many public car parks. Easy to drive, with no gearbox to speak of, EVs offer good power at low speeds. They can also prove to be more economical too, with the cost of running one predicted to add around only a quarter to your residential electricity bill, far lower than the costs of a petrol car. Some have pointed to charging arrangements as being a factor in whether to ‘go electric’, with reports of dferent connectors by dferent carmakers cited.  In November , Bill Wiggin MP proposed introducing the Electric VehiclesBill to the House of Commons. This bill aims to standardise the connector types, payment and charging process for EVs. President of the Automobile Association Edmund King described the proposal as: “a welcome move and a breath of fresh air”. He pointed out that while payment is an issue, with dferent cards and apps used by dferent providers, there is a growing standardisation of connectors across the UK and Europe. Energy use  The trend towards an electric motoring future seems set to continue, which is why being in total control of your energy use makes sense. Requesting a smart meter from your energy supplier and using it to review your gas and electricity consumption is an easy way to make the right kind of impact on your wallet, and it could help you reduce your carbon footprint. The smart meter in-home display will also make it easier to be aware of the real cost of your electric vehicle’s fuel usage – putting you firmly in the driving seat.

Michael Cameron, , took bookings for up to  guests per night at his nine-bedroom home in West Linton, Peeblesshire, Scotland.The high-end property boasts a gym, hot tubs, cinema room, games room and also offers a private chauffeur service. He specialised in hen party bookings but also accepted guests for birthdays and special events. Pictures uploaded to an unofficial Facebook page set up by revellers show them enjoying hot tubs and posing with giant inflatable penises. Mr Cameron had accepted  bookings in  with a maximum cost of pound, for a weeks booking. But neighbours had contacted police and council officials to complain about noise coming from parties.  Scottish Borders Council investigated the claims and issued an enforcement notice ordering Mr Cameron to stop renting the house to guests. He protested claiming he had been letting for at least  years without incident and has now appealed to the Scottish Government in a bid to have the order overturned. His lawyers have written to the government outlining his appeal. They said: The notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity. Mr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.  They added: He was therefore surprised to receive the notice when he knew that he was already actively engaging with the council and taking all reasonable measures to deal with the issues raised by those who were complaining. Mr Cameron said he had made plans to remove two hot tubs from the rear of the house and move a barbecue area in a bid to combat disturbance. He also said he would install a night duty officer to help monitor noise levels and provide concerned neighbours with a direct contact line to voice complaints. The house website features several reviews from guests. One said: We booked Linton Lodge for its location to Edinburgh and the fact it slept so many. It looked amazing on photos but they cannot get across the true wow factor you get when you see this house for real.  We were lucky with the weather all weekend and spent most of our time in the hot tubsor on the front lawn. We played lawn games through the day, hired a local spa company to give people treatments in the gym, had a movie night...the list is endless. This house made a hen party into a trip I will never forget. It was just perfect. The council had written to Mr Cameron outlining their position. They said: The regular turnover of visitors, combined with guests having access to outside entertainment areas is having a detrimental impact on neighbouring residential amenity. In terms of the character of the property, the house while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.  The characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity. As stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including Environmental health and the Anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland. Taking cognisance of the above, a material change of use of the property from a dwelling house providing residential accommodation to a short stay commercial visitor accommodation has occurred. Police Scotland confirmed they had been called to the property in the summer. A decision will released at a later date.

The football pools saw punters staking a bet to predict the scores of matches up and down the country. In the days before the National Lottery, the pools was the only chance for the ordinary man or woman in the street to win le-changing sums. Pottery worker Edwin Dodd shycelebrated a pound, pools win in  – a fortune in those days. Mr Dodd, , was working for  shillings a week in Stoke-on-Trent while recovering from a major operation. He was able to buy a newsagents business and a home for himself, his we and their four-year-old son. Almost  years later, Mr Dodd recalled: “The win saved my le becauseI had not had the money, I would have carried on working.   “I would rather have died working than starve.” Miner Keith Nicholson and his we Viv, from Castleford, West Yorks, won pound, in  – equivalent to around pound.million today. Viv famously vowed to “spend, spend, spend”. It took the couple just three years to blow their winnings after they splashed out on cars, furs, champagne parties and a ranch-style home. When Keith died in a car crash four years after their win, a huge tax bill left Viv bankrupt. Her le story was turned into a West End musical before her death three years ago. The first win of more than a million pounds went to a group of nurses from Wiltshire in .  Graham Barlow, from Leicester, was just about to give up playing as his weekly stake was proving a financial strain when he hit the jackpot in September . With pregnant we Diane due to give birth shortly, Graham planned to tell his dad Arthur that he was throwing the towel in on the pools. But Graham decided to try his luck for one more week and the father-and-son partnership became pools millionaires, winning pound,, between them. In , Michael Elliott, from Brechin, Angus, became the first ever triple millionaire in the -year history of the pools. He won pound,, for a pound stake – sealed by Clitheroe’s - draw with Fylde in the Evo-Stik Premier League.  He said after winning: “I cannot believe it. It is a dream come true. To say this is a le-changing experience would be the understatement of the year. I’ve played the Pools for many years and won three times before, my biggest previous win was pound.” Joe Bosher, from Tyneside, thought he had won the jackpot in  when his selections came in. A pal lent him pound to shycelebrate and he hit the town, only to find his we in floods of tears when he ed home. Joe had given his coupon to -year-old son Joseph to put on for him, but Joseph had binned it and spent the stake on sweets for him and his mates instead. But stories like Joe’s didn’t deter the punters, at its height the pools attracted  million players every week, all dreaming of the big win.  Now a new pools game, Footie, has been launched to bring that shyexcitement to a new generation of football fans. The pools also made a billionaire of Liverpool businessman Sir John Moores but the game wasn’t invented by Moores himself. The original idea was thought up by John Jervis Barnard, from Birmingham, who realised that most of his friends liked both football and placing bets. At the time betting was only legal on racecourses, so he came up with the idea of punters guessing the outcome of football matches and collecting their winnings from the pool of stakes. He thought taking % of the pot as management costs would give him a tidy income. But he was ready to give up on the idea when he met Moores, who saw potential in it and took the idea back to his home town Manchester.  He and his pals Colin Askham and Bill Hughes were constantly looking for money-making ideas to get them out of working at the Post Office. They each invested pound in the scheme, bought a cheap printing press, rented an office in Liverpool and named their business Littlewoods – Askham’s birth name before he was adopted as a child. They printed off , coupons and handed them out at Manchester United’s Old Trafford ground on a match day in  – but only  were ed. The project continued to lose money and Hughes and Askham wanted to throw in the towel, but not Moores. He bought them out after his we Ruby said: “I’d rather be married to a man haunted by failure than one haunted by regret.” There were to be no failures or regret when the football pools shyeventually captured the imagination of the nation, with millions listening to the results coming in on the radio. It was the ultimate gamble that paid off for Moores – when he died in , aged,  he was shyestimated to be worth more than poundbillion.

Its Meghans last official engagement before Christmas. Giles Cooper, the charitys chairman, welcomed the royal. He said: The timing of the visit is fantastic as it comes a few weeks after the Royal Variety performance which she attended with Prince Harry.   And it comes after her wedding, which all the residents here were watching. We had the television on, Union Jack bunting up and a party atmosphere - so its nice to have the bride here.

Aisha Wadoodi, defending, said Holton spared the girl having to give evidence in a trial by pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity. He had an IQ of  and dficulties including dyslexia, Aspergers, overdoses, self-harm, isolation, anger, auditory hallucinations and disturbed sleep. He had been in care since he was nine, lived in seven care homes, he resorted to taking cannabis and developed an addiction. Its hardly surprising he needed something to alleviate the pain he was going through, said Ms Wadoodi. He doesnt have the tools to deal with it. A psychiatrist and probation worker had concerns about him coping and being brutalised in the prison regime. Judge Howard Crowson told Holton: This seems to have happened because of the condition you put yourself in. You had enough insight to know this type of behaviour was wrong. You offended in this way primarily because you intoxicated from cannabis and drink. He said the young girl had been given good advice and told her mother what happened as soon as possible. There was scientic evidence which proved she was right, added the judge. This will be your first prison sentence. That will clearly be dficult for you. Holton, of Leigh, Greater Manchester, was jailed for three years, with a years extra licence. He was given a sexual harm prevention order governing contact and work with under-s and will be on the sex offenders register, both indefinitely.

Bethany Herauville, , is so allergic to everyday things including dust, perfume, nuts, metal and even money that she has to wear gloves and a face mask. She finds it hard to leave her home, use public transport and go out to work. And just a small contact with something she is allergic to can send her into anaphylactic shock, the Hull Daily Mail reports. Tragically, Bethany also receives a lot of abuse when she is out in public with her mask and gloves, which she has reported to police.  Mum whose half a heart toddler wont live beyond teens wants to go before him Its very debilitating to have so many allergies - going out isnt easy and for the past four years I havent been able to go abroad as travelling is too much of a nightmare, said Bethany. Everyday can be a struggle, as I really have to watch what I eat as Im allergic to so many things including nuts, fruits and vegetables, and even getting dressed can be a challenge as Im allergic to metal, so I have to avoid things like zips on trousers by wearing shorts so the metal doesnt touch my body, and wearing gloves to do the zip up and down. I can also just get spontaneous allergic reactions from nowhere, which are impossible to manage and cause me to go into anaphylactic shock. This closes up my throat and affects my breathing, meaning I need to use my emergency medical bag with an EpiPen and ring an ambulance to take me to hospital for treatment. To try and manage my condition and reduce the amount of allergens Im breathing in, I started wearing a mask in May this year which has helped me, but I get a lot of abuse when I go out and wear it in public.  I get funny looks from people when I walk past them in the street as I think they must reckon Im contagious or something - Ive had Darth Vader comments made at me which I reported to the police. Ive walked in to shops before and had dont rob us shouted at me which really isnt funny. I even got sacked from a job because I was told that I was unapproachable because I wore a mask and a comment was made to me askingI had an infectious disease, which really wasnt nice. Due to her illness, Bethany has to be rushed to hospital at least once a month as a result of anaphylactic shock after an allergic reaction, and has to be cared for at least  hours before she can go home. There is no diagnosis as to why she has allergies, and has to manage her condition as best she can by avoiding foods that trigger it, as well as carrying around an emergency kit should she go in to shock.  The condition has caused Bethany to be in a dark place before, but she has recently launched a Facebook support group called Say Boo To Allergies to raise awareness and provide useful tips on how to cope. My allergies do really get me down at times, and I know that I could end my le so easily by just dipping my finger in a jar of Nutella and putting it in my mouth, but I wouldnt do that as I have such a great support network around me, she said. I wake up every morning and see my wes face next to me, and that reassures me that I have got something to live for. I really do have great people around me, including my in laws who support me and know what I can and cant eat and touch, and when Im around them, I forget that there is anything wrong with me. I also have cognitive behavioural therapy to improve my mental health in relation to my allergies, and that really helps. Bethany says the support group she has set up also gives her a purpose and so far, she feels its been really successful.  There are actually a lot of people in Hull that suffer from allergies, and the first meeting I had in the city was really positive with the MP Emma Hardy attending, as well as someone from the Food and Trading Standards Agency, parents whose children have allergies and older people too. I run the group in partnership with the Anaphylaxis Campaign, a charity that I volunteer at who help people at risk from severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. I want people like me to know that they are not alone, and that we can get through this. Anyone is welcome to join the Say Boo To Allergies Facebook group for support, and the group will next meet again in the New Year.

Maybe this season we have had a more inconsistent start than in previous years.“It has just taken that bit longer to get going but at this time of year we always get the results we need.“The one thing for us is to get to the turn of the year and be sitting up there within that top four.“That will give us that  to build upon for the rest of the season.”Aberdeen’s early inconsistent league form has seen them sit under the radar with all the focus on Hearts, Kilmarnock and Rangers being the contenders to put pressure on Celtic.Considine insists he doesn’t care about critics writing them off as all the Dons’ focus has been on rising up the league standings.He said: “Let everyone speak about everyone  at the top of the league.“We just let our football do the talking. We take it game by game and just keep grinding out results.“Sometimes you are not always going to play well. Butyou get the right results and take your chances then you will still climb up the league.“We know what we need to do and we have another huge game against Dundee and that is where our thoughts are.“December was always going to be massive for us and we have four more games to go.“If we can pick up four good results we could be sitting second or third.“That would be a good position going into the New Year.”Considine played a key role in the - win over Premiership bottom club St Mirren. The opening goal came from a penalty awarded for a foul on him.For the winner Sam Cosgrove netted the rebound after Considine’s header hit the bar.The big defender said: “It was instilled into us that we must start on the same note to the way we finished off against Livingston.“That was the message the manager got into us before the game.“It probably took us  or  minutes to get going but we still felt we were in control.“St Mirren had one free-kick and they scored from it.“I haven’t seen it again but I think one of our boys is potentially playing him onside.“I am not too sure because he seems to be standing by himself.”For the second game in succession Aberdeen conceded having taken an early lead.They secured the winner in Paisley through a header from Sam Cosgrove, his second in two games, the striker having also netted in the - defeat of Livingston.Considine said: “In the second half we were straight on the front foot.“We created a number of chances and young Connorwas brilliant, taking on his man, getting to the byline and putting in crosses.“We were putting balls in behind them and trying to stretch their back three.“We managed to get a head to it from the free kick from Nialland thankfully the rebound was put in by big Sam.“I was delighted for him.

A government that can lead us through the Brexit impasse that currently exists.“We are at risk of leaving the EU without a deal, a position I hope we can all agree would be disastrous, not just for the people of Aberdeen, but the UK as a whole.”Speaking after the meeting, Ms Laing said she had hoped the SNP would back her call for a general election.She added: “Unfortunately the rhetoric that comes with the SNP was fully on show today in that they say in public they want a general election but when they get an opportunity to vote for one they vote against it.”Backing a people’s vote, SNP group leader Stephen Flynn said the council had to defend the % of the city’s population who are EU nationals.He added: “Any Brexit at this stage is likely to damage Aberdeen.“Democracy is to go to the people and ask for their views.”He was backed up by EU citizen and SNP councillor Christian Allard, a Frenchman who said he would not be willing to apply to live in Scotland – where he has made a le for  years.However, Douglas Lumsden, Conservative group leader and co-leader of the council, said councillors should take no action, adding they should be “more concerned by Mastrick and not Maastricht”. Mr Lumsden, who said he voted to remain in the EU referendum, added: “A total of .m people voted to leave the EU. For the sake of democracy it must be delivered and it will be delivered.”He added the motion was “absolutely pointless”, claiming a second referendum would be a “disaster for democracy”.Liberal Democrat group leader Ian Yuill said: “We now know that promises made about Brexit, like £ million a week extra for the NHS and getting a deal with the ‘exact same benefits’ as EU membership, cannot be kept.“Since the start of the month it has become blindingly clear that the Brexit process is a mess and the Prime Minister’s exit deal is clearly doomed.“A people’s vote would put the UK’s citizens back in control and give everyone the chance to decide whether the Prime Minister’s deal is good for the country andthe UK should leave the EU on those terms.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/ee-cr-111218-01-003.jpg-789x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet can you give one of these animals a new home dec15","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home  vw, px\"  Lovely laidback ladies Ruby and Sophie are looking for a forever home together.The pair, who are  years old, still enjoy their walks but also like a sofa day too.Someone who is at home most of the time would be ideal for these girls, who are likely to follow their new owner around the home.The pooches, who are not suited to a household with children, will need to be kept on a hypoallergenic diet. vw, px\"  Gorgeous girl Freya is looking for a new owner who can take her on lots of country walks.The six-year-old, who has been neutered, has previously beem around children and will need an owner with experience of the breed.Freya is also used to other dogs but can can be quite vocal with them until she gets to know them.Can you give her a home  vw, px\"  Handsome lad Louie is on the prowl for a new home where he can get outdoors to explore.Although six-month-old Louie can be quite a feisty boy, he also adores receiving cuddles.And when it comes to playtime, this cute cat has lightning reflexes.It is not knownLouie has previously been around other animals or children.Can you give him a home Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"calls for cycle path on aberdeens king street","story":"A competition to design a bike path for a major Aberdeen street has been launched by a city group.The Aberdeen Cycle Forum began the new campaign for King Street, with the hope of hearing ideas from people all over the world.Designs for a segregated bike path are being sought, which would see a separate lane created for cyclists, with a barrier between traffic.Currently there are sections of specic lanes on the busy street, however they are often shared with buses, as is the case on Union Street.Campaigns and community secretary for Aberdeen Cycle Forum Rachel Martin said: “We would love to see King Street transformed into a great place to cycle.“We recognise that designing something is quite challenging so we thought we would open it up to get inspiration from all over the world.”Ideally, the bike path would run the entireof King Street from the Seaton area up to the Castlegate.From there, it would join the proposed bike path on Union Street, which would run up until Holburn Street.In future, it is hoped it could also link to Bridge of Don.Rachel said: “At a minimum, it would run at least from the university to Castlegate which would join the Union Street path and go all the way to Holburn Street.“From there, it’s a little way from the Deeside Way, so we’d like to join them all up.“It’s not continuous on King Street and there’s buses. It’s the same problem we have on Union Street.“I have cycled down King Street before and it’s pretty scary.“We would like to see a segregated bike path, with a barrier between the path and cars.”The Aberdeen Cycle Forum recognises the dficulties that lie in designing a path for King Street, which involves several busy junctions and a roundabout.Part of the design process will also see residents and other interested parties decidean appropriate solution would include paths on both sides of the road or two-sided on one side of the road.Rachel said: “There’s lots of options. We want to bring more to the table. There’ll be people who live in a city where they’ve had similar challenges and will be able to share ideas.”It is thought the new infrastructure would make the city more attractive to students and university staff, helping to attract both groups in the long term.The winning designs will be showcased on the Aberdeen Cycle Forum website as well as being submitted to Aberdeen City Council.There will be a prize for each category, with the winner aged under  receiving a £ voucher, those between  and  years old will get a £ voucher and adults over the age of  will receive a £ voucher.The prizes for the competition have been donated by Edinburgh Bicycle Cooperative, where the prizes can be redeemed.Aberdeen Cycle Forum also held a petition earlier this year to see a segregated bike path created on Union Street.The petition will be reviewed as part of Aberdeen City Council’s Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan .To take part in the competition, visit https:kingstreet.awards"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/EE-DB-18122018-01-009.jpg-125x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"inspectors praise for north east nursery","story":"A north-east nursery has been praised by inspectors.The Care Inspectorate visited Fyvie Primary School on November  and said in a report: “Staff were respectful and nurturing in their interaction with the children.”They rated the care, support and environment of the nursery as “very good” – the second best of six possible ratings.A parent told inspectors: “Staff are amazing.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

The buildings on the main street and the front street just look sad.The front green for years has waited and unfortunately it still waits#this time for the council to clear away debris after a storm.Come on # the place looks bad enough. Clear it up as it happens or do something in the development plan to make sure it doesn’t in the future.Name and address supplied.What do you think about Lochgilphead and its future  Contact the Advertiser on editor@argyllshireadvertiser or message us directly via Facebook. Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

To be clear, funding for our core services is being cut again.#For Argyll and Bute this increases our estimated funding gap for next year to £ million.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste.

Elliott Summers, , of Bellesleyhill Road, Ayr, was found guilty after trial of the rape of a -year-old woman on July , last year. Judge Lord Kinclaven told first offender Summers: “You have been found guilty of a serious sexual offence and there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.” Summers, who was placed on the sex offenders register, worked at Glasgow Prestwick Airport as general manager for air traffic control and then in  became managing director at Norwich Airport in England. Recently he was working as a practice manager at a GP surgery in Glasgow. Solicitor advocate Murray Macara QC said: “He maintains he did not rape this woman and maintains that whatever sexual conduct took place was of a limited nature and was consensual. Mr Macara handed over a dozen testimonials from work colleagues of Summers. The QC said that his client objected to some of the comments in the background report compiled on him which referred to him a displaying toxic masculinity” and described him as a misogynist. Mr Macara said that Summers was highly thought of at work. He went on: “He worked as an air traffic controller and had senior managerial roles at two airports. During the trial Summers victim told of how they met online and then she visited his cottage. She took a bottle of wine for him and bottled water for herself. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she arrived around .pm to pm and Summers, who was drunk, grabbed her and forcefully kissed her at the door. He told her that he had been drinking at the pub since .pm and she said he was so drunk he was unable to work the remote control for the television. Summers, then put his hand inside her bra, made a disparaging comment about her nipples and suggested that she looked older than . She said took her hand and took her into the bedroom which was pitch black and added: “I tried to push him away with both hands. I repeatedly said No, this is not happening.” When Summers fell asleep his terried victim managed to get out of the bed and get dressed. The womans daughter said her mother was distressed and crying and told her she had been raped and police were called. When quizzed by police Summers denied all responsibility for any rape and said that there was consensual sexual intercourse that evening. The GP practice in Glasgow where Summers was employed as a practice manager said: His employment was terminated at the end of last month after his conviction for rape.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSex crimeAyrCourtsAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girvan town set revamp new","story":"NewsGirvan town set for revamp with new CCTV to be installedIn recent months, the town has seen a spike in thefts, with  recorded last month.ShareByPippa Smith:,  DEC NewsCllr Alec Clark believes that the new installation of the CCTV cameras is a win-win for the community \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGirvan’s thoroughfare is set to get a revamp of new CCTV cameras. In recent months, the town has seen a spike in thefts, with  recorded last month. And residents at Girvan Community Council raised questions over the lack of CCTV along Dalrymple Street. Now council bosses have confirmed that a replacement has been ordered to be installed in the next few weeks due to the current cameras nearing their ‘operational le’. A spokesman said: “Due to intermittent issues with CCTV in Dalrymple Street we recently carried out repairs to make sure our Emergency Response Team can monitor the area  hours a day. “However, given the camera is now nearing the end of its operational le, and to make sure the system is fully fit for purpose, we’ve ordered a replacement which is due to be installed in the next few weeks. Cllr Alec Clark believes that the new installation of the CCTV cameras is a win-win for the Girvan community.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward. The opening of the Lodge is one step in many that the board are currently working towards and we are looking forward to unveiling the other plans that we have been working on very soon.” "},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

the architects and builders of Abbotsford, and original installers of the Portcullis Gate December , .The Portcullis Gate, made of oak and wrought iron, was designed by Scott between  and , creating a grand entrance for visitors to his home.It remained an integral part of Scotts lsquoconundrum castle.But it had suffered many years of continuing deterioration, reaching the point where conservation was critical to avoid it falling apart.Keith, great-great-grandson of Thomas Smith, was delighted to keep the family connection with the gate and told the invited audience of Abbotsford donors and Friends about the link between theSmith family, Darnick and Abbotsford.Keith said: ldquoAbbotsford is a joy.\"My family and others from Darnick are proud to have played a part in its construction.\"The gates are a tribute to local craftsmen - ancient and modern.Initial plans by The Abbotsford Trust, to replace the old wood and repair the wrought ironwork on the gate, were revised when research by The Scottish Conservation Studio revealed the Portcullis Gate was not a mismatch of wood of ying quality as originally thought, but was in fact all original wood from Scottrsquos time.The project turned into one of conservation rather than replacement.Pippa Coles, Abbotsfordrsquos Gardens Heritage Development Manager, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to see the gate back in position and looking as Scott intended.\"Earlier this year, I read in John Smithrsquos diary that the gate had originally arrived on December , , so I felt it was a fitting date for their , and it was extra special that Keith, Johnrsquos descendant could join us.ldquoWe are very grateful to our funders and donors who made this important conservation project possible.\"We hope visitors to Abbotsford in the New Year, when we reopen in March, will enjoy walking through the grand entrance, just as Scottrsquos guests did nearly  years ago.The skilled restoration work was undertaken by Charles Taylor Woodwork, based in Dalkeith.The gates were removed last December, dried out and then dismantled and recorded before work began.The original wooden frame was badly damaged and has been replaced, while the internal lattice work has been restored by splicing in good wood from the old frame.Despite its name, the Portcullis Gate is hinged and not raised and dropped by a pulley system.It derives its name from its design, which references the style of a portcullis, an image of which is also carved above the gate.Scottrsquos use of this defensive symbol at the main entry to his home suggests that he viewed Abbotsford as a personal sanctuary.The portcullis image was also used by Scott on his personal book bindings in his library, where the symbol is accompanied by the Latin motto Clausus Tutus Ero , signalling Scottrsquos attitude to Abbotsford as a place of safety from the outside world.Due to its symbolic recurrence throughout Abbotsford, the Portcullis Gate is considered by many to be one of the homersquos most important features.It not only serves as an image of grandeur for guests arriving at Abbotsford, but also symbolises Scottrsquos intentions for Abbotsford as a place of retreat from the chaos of the outside world.The gate was so iconic that it was photographed by William Fox Talbot in October,  for his book The Sun Pictures of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"thea-and-thomas-are-the-most-popular-baby-names-in-the-borders","story":"BORDERS parents have gone against the grain when choosing baby names this year.The most popular choice for new-born girls in the region during the past  months is Thea -

walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining

Mrs Mayrsquos features are blank not because shersquos brave, but because she lacks either the courage or the will to change course and save the country from the catastrophe we all face.To be clear, this Remain-voting PM is either stupid enough to try and go ahead with a policy that even her own Government says will be massively damaging to the people of this country, or too cowardly to stop it. Which of these chilling realities is worse Like the robot she jokingly impersonated a few months ago at the Conservative Party conference, the Maybot keeps going through the motions of the disastrous, unsupportable deal she has cobbled together. But that joke isnrsquot funny anymore, especially as Mrs May must bear much of the responsibility for the impossible situation she has found herself in over the last weeks and months.:Flag expert: lsquoThe use of the Union Jack has never been so positive in ScotlandrsquoMake no mistake, this is not only a perfect storm but also a crisis of her own making. It was the PM, after all, who came up with the ill-conceived and wrong-headed red lines of the deal without consulting Parliament or even trying to build consensus and bring MPs with her. She has ignored the Scottish Parliamentrsquos objections and resisted every attempt at Westminster to give MPs a say in the process.Mrs May is not a person any of us, the poor so-and-sos who will suffer economically, socially and culturallyshe goes through with this folly, should feel sympathy for.At this crucial point I believe we should extend the hand of Christmas friendship to another isive figure, however: Tony Blair.The former PM has been embracing the sort of leadership and pragmatism Mrs May continues to reject by quietly chinning EU leaders behind the scenes, trying to hammer out a solution to the terrible situation we all find ourselves in. And, since hersquos intelligent and sane as well as extremely well connected, Mr Blair has come up with a sensible and cogent way forward. The catch is, of course, it would require the sort of leap of imagination the current PM seems incapable of.Instead of trying to keep flogging her dead horse, Mrs May should, according to her predecessor, become a facilitator for MPs to decide the next step. If no consensus can be found in Parliament, he justiably backs a public vote to determine whether Brexit should go ahead.Crucially, he also says the EU should ndash and would - make concessions on some of the issues that led to Brexit in the first place, such as free movement, thus allowing some EU doubters to come back into the fold and vote to cancel Brexit. Being seen to listen to concerns over immigration, to offer some flexibility to nation states, would surely be welcomed more widely across Europe, too.Showing uncharacteristic emotion, perhaps sensing hersquos on to something, Mrs May has angrily accused Mr Blair of undermining her talks. Predictably, the Corbyn faithful has also blown a gasket at his intervention Labourrsquos former leader remains the anti-Christ in their eyes because of his decision to involve Britain in the Iraq war.The whole lot of them need to move on, Labour from Iraq and the Tories from their calamitous belief that Brexit can and should happen. Lest we forget Mr Blair, though undoubtedly flawed, was the last politician able to gain the broad support of most people in Britain, regardless of their background or ideology.Hersquos the sort of pragmatic centrist the country is crying out for right now, and over the festive season Irsquoll be praying Mrs May has a Christmas epiphany and follows his lead."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Did the best woman win The Apprentice final ","story":"Yet this th series, which ended with an all-women final last night, has seen the show rejuvenated.

If SNP ministers commit to scrap the unfair, outdated Council Tax and indicate support for giving councils the power to raise more of their own funds, we can at least begin to talk about the coming yearrsquos budget. But of course that budget must protect our public services, and the time for those talks is fast running out.:Cosla President: This budget could put the final nail into our communitiesSince , the Scottish Government has seen its budget fall by % in real terms, but it has passed on real terms cuts of around % to local government.Councils, who employ around  in  of the Scottish workforce, have seen the biggest relative decline in jobs in the Scottish public sector as a result.At the same time, the countryrsquos ageing population has increased demand for care services, adding to the strain on budgets.The spending watchdog Audit Scotland warned last month that three-quarters of councils were forced to raid their reserves to shore up spending last year, and the unrelenting pressure on budgets means ldquodficult decisions lay ahead.Labour MSP James Kelly said: ldquoRather than insult people with spin, Derek MacKay should be delivering a budget that delivers the radical investment local services need.Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoOnce again local government is getting the short end of the stick. Nicola Sturgeonrsquos SNP have passed down cut after cut to local funds and expected councils to deal with it.

The first email came from Dad. An old teacher of mine from back in Northern Ireland, where I was brought up, had died. Dad wrote telling me what happened. The email surprised me ndash not because of the news about my teacher, but because it was my dad whorsquod written it. I thought our relationship was in the grave too. I replied briefly, and with no ill will, but I was curious why Irsquod even responded. Our relationship had been so bad and unpleasant over the years that I wondered why I risked rekindling it.A month later, I was working on a family tree for my mum, and for some reason I cannot fathom ndash curiosity, maybe, a subconscious need for resolution, perhaps ndash I sent my dad a few questions about our genealogy. My mum and dad had a stormy and unhappy marriage. Dad was often absent, and when he was home he seemed in a constant state of rage. He and I rarely spent more than a few minutes together when I was a boy, and after my parents split up when I was in my early twenties, our relationship withered to a few awkward drinks once a year and the odd telephone conversation.I resented him for all the things I felt Irsquod missed out on that other young men had experienced. It made me sad when I heard friends talking about how much they loved their dad and how hersquod taught them to swim, or ride a bike, or shave ndash wersquod done none of those things together. We dfer in almost every way, and wersquove no hinterlandndash no shared memories of good times.Dad, though, had his own demons ndash he had a painful childhood and he knows that damaged him when it came to being a father himself.Still, itrsquos strange how it was an email about a family tree, which laid down the roots for the new, tentative relationship dad and I are experiencing now.Dad replied to my email with a whole swathe of information that hersquod separately been gathering as research into the family tree. Hersquod uncovered a completely unknown branch of the Mackay family in America that I knew nothing about. Hersquod learned of them in the years of cold war when he and I didnrsquot utter a word to each other.I ended up in touch with those relatives in America and this summer a long-lost cousin called Alice ndash fittingly, a retired social worker ndash came to Scotland and we spent some time together. When I spoke to her about my father, I realised that I was no longer boiling with anger towards him, in fact, I suddenly became aware that the anger Irsquod held was as destructive for me as it was for him. As I talked to this charming stranger who shared some of the blood in my veins, it dawned on me for the first time that what I felt was real sadness about my father. Loss, even. Sadness for a connection that never was, loss of memories that neither of us had ever had ndash and regret that so much of what had gone on between my father and I was steeped in anger, and even hate, on both sides.What a god-awful pointless waste of two lives, I thought, as I found myself talking to my cousin about my dad. At this point, anger may have been put to one side and replaced with a melancholy for things that never were, but I still didnrsquot want to see my father again. We have an expression in our family ndash ldquoitrsquos all blood under the bridge, which might give you an idea of what kind of family we are ndash but I felt far too much blood had flowed under the bridge for us to ever be in the same room again.Then, however, I had a little intimation of my own mortality. I had a brush with ill-health this year that pulled me up sharp. I realised that one day I wonrsquot be here ndash and with that comes the knowledge that others wonrsquot be here one day either. It made me look on all my relationships with new eyes ndash to turn toward those I truly love and care for and value them all the more, and all those people were my family. There was a ghost at the feast though ndash and his name was Don, my dad.Serendipity seems to have reigned over so much of this new coming together of my dad and I ndash an email at just the right time, a family tree prodding the subconscious onward, a long-lost relative, a moment of sickness. So, when Dad wrote to me not long after Irsquod recovered, and askedwe could meet and try to put the past behind us, I was ready to agree. Neither of us would be here forever.And so, not long ago, my dad came to Scotland for three days and we spent more time in each otherrsquos company than wersquove ever done in our lives. My father and I had never even been to the cinema together, I realised. So we went to the movies and we had a laugh. We had a few decent meals and some good conversations.I think that for the first time in our lives we enjoyed each otherrsquos company ndash and thatrsquos a fine and good thing after four decades of simmering tension, dislike and anger. Wersquove a long way to go ndash we may not ever be bosom buddies, and thatrsquos fine as well.I wish English had a word for ldquohappy-sad, as thatrsquos how I feel about this little step my father and I have taken towards each other ndash and the time of year only adds to the mix of emotions, because this will be the first Christmas when Dad and I might truly feel like family at last that we belong to each other after all."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9189239.jpg?type=article-full","title":"plans-for-a-no-deal-brexit-being-stepped-up-after-criticism-for-theresa-mays-plan-admits-cabinet-minister","story":"\"We have been takingno deal seriously for quite some considerable period.

After her deal is defeated in mid-January, she will delay and preicate, let the days and hours tick by until a hard Brexit becomes an imminent reality. She will then force Parliament to accept her deal to avoid no deal. From her point of view it makes sense. The reality is that Labour risks colluding with this irresponsible brinksmanship. It has been playing around with presentational ersions to avoid having to make any strategic decision about unblocking Brexit.The Prime Minister batted away Jeremy Corbynrsquos contrived attempt to move a confidence motion in her personally, but not her Government ndash a ldquomotion of no consequence as itrsquos been called. A properly tabled confidence motion, which Labour knows is the only one that would have been put to a vote, would likely have been defeated as Tory MPs united around their beleaguered leader. But at least this would have moved Parliament and the nation on.It would have made crystal clear that an early General Election is off the table ndash which of course is why Labourrsquos bottled it. Instead we have a crippling stasis lasting now well into the New Year. Thereafter, a hair-raising game of chicken, in which the stakes are the very peace of the realm, as confirmed yesterday by the Governmentrsquos proposal to deploy , troops on the streets and ports in March.I keep hearing lamentations from Labour supporters who find themselves yearning for theof Tony Blair. The discredited former PM is the only politician who seems to be offering anything remotely resembling leadership right now. He has been perambulating around Europe, much to Mrs Mayrsquos displeasure, urging EU leaders to take seriously the possibility of the repeat referendum he advocates. He brushes aside the argument that this would be a betrayal of democracy. Nonsense, he says: a referendum IS democracy ndash the only democratic solution when Parliament is deadlocked.:SNP and Lib Dems put down no-confidence motion in Theresa Mays GovernmentIn one sense Labour is more united than ever. Both the youth wing, and the activists of Momentum, are ardent Remainers and desperate for another referendum. In this they are joined by the old Blairite Labour Right, led by former shadow cabinet luminaries like Chukka Umunna and Hilary Benn. But the old Labour Left, who by an accident of history happen to occupy the Labour leadership right now, are Eurosceptics in the proper sense of the word. Mr Corbyn says he voted Remain in , but Labourrsquos  manesto made a clear promise to deliver Brexit and end free movement.Labour only really opposes Mrs Mayrsquos version of Brexit because it doesnrsquot protect workplace rights and doesnrsquot guarantee friction-free trade. Mr Corbyn says he wants a General Election so that he can go off and negotiate a version of the Withdrawal Agreement that doesnrsquot have these limitations. But everyone knows this is pure fantasy ndash an insult to the intelligence of the voters. Eventhere were time for a General Election and a renegotiation before March, it would be futile. The Withdrawal Agreement is a legally drafted document, negotiated over two and half long years, and has been endorsed by all  remaining states. Unless the UK is prepared to lt its red lines and stay in the single market with Norway, which Labour isnrsquot prepared to do, then there is nothing more to be said. The Irish backstop would remain because Labour is committed to avoiding a border.The logic of Labourrsquos position should surely be to wrest what concessions it can from Mrs May about workplace protections and the Good Friday Agreement and then back her amended deal. The Withdrawal Agreement is not, after all, the future trade agreement with the European Union. It only sorts the immediate problems of paying the orce bill and guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens, here and in Ireland. The Political Declaration on the future relations with the EU that accompanied the Withdrawal Agreement is much more contentious. Itrsquos a vague wish list in which the only definitive red line is on free movement, insisted upon by Mrs May. Labour should surely be using its influence now to ensure that the future trade deal keeps Britain in that ldquopermanent customs union and single market alignment that Mr Corbyn always talks about.Now, many Scots will be appalled at this suggestion that Labour should back Mrs May, and I hasten to add that it is not my own position. I would never have left the European Union in the first place. Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and has been treated abominably in the Brexit process. Scotlandrsquos legitimate interests in securing a Brexit that doesnrsquot damage Scottish economic and civic le have been peremptorily dismissed by Westminster. Nicola Sturgeonrsquos proposals for Scotland to have similar regulatory alignment with the EU, as accepted for Northern Ireland, were batted away without a thought.The UK Governmentrsquos subsequent legal jiggery-pokery has damaged the constitutional standing of the Scottish Parliament. The Sewel Convention, under which the Scottish Parliament had to consent to Westminster legislation that cuts across its devolved powers, has been exposed as a sham. No backstop there. The Scottish Parliamentrsquos Continuity Bill, which sought to ensure that Holyrood retained its devolved powers as they were repatriated from Brussels, was disposed of by retrospective legislation which would have shamed a banana republic. Scotlandrsquos requests for devolution of responsibilities like immigration have also been ignored.But the unfortunate reality is that Scotland is irrelevant right now. The Westminster parties are entirely preoccupied with their own Brexit psychodrama.

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit. That’s a substantial investment to ensure our under s get the best possible start in le and reflects this government’s emphasis on the early years.“Our focus on supporting people on low incomes, and the action we are taking stands in stark contrast to the UK Government, who last week was criticised by the UN Poverty Rapporteur for being in denial about the damage and misery that their welfare cuts were causing.”Connie is  and lives in Glasgow her baby is five months old.“I heard about the Pregnancy and Baby Payment through One Parent Families Scotland, who told me all about the grant and how to apply for it,” she said.“The payment will go toward clothes, nappies and shoes for my son, babies grow so quickly and he’s five months now.“This will make a real dference to me, it’s not a payment I was expecting. It will make le a bit easier, my income stays the same, but my outgoings are higher as this is my third child. My other children are four and five so the things I had for them I don’t have anymore, so I’m kinda starting again.“I got the baby box which is great, but you get size - month clothes in that, so the £ would be of benefit when he’s a wee bit bigger.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Dead as a doornail.Yet of all the good days in the year, on Christmas eve the Prime Minister still sat in her Downing Street office, the door open that she might keep an eye on her clerks.Gavin Barwell and Robbie Gibb sat in the light of a very small fire, barely visible in the shadows cast by piles of draft Withdrawal Agreements, assurances and side-letters, backstops to the backstop, and flowcharts pointing at dferent fates for May.Hands freezing, backs bent, they scratched out desperate plans to force her deal through the Commons. Scurrying over the floorboards in the dark, damp corners, whips searched for votes.May’s phone vibrated and cast a shaft of light into the darkness – a text. “You don’t have to do this, Theresa. I’m just trying to help. Merry Christmas, TB.”“Nothing has changed!” she wheezed, firing back: “Keep Brexit in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”Leaving her clerks to their work, May climbed the stairs to her apartment to take her melancholy dinner and try and unwind in front of a relaxing episode of ‘Naval Crime Investigation Service ’.No sooner had she nodded off than May was awoken by a clanking, thudding sound on the stairs, growing closer, and louder, relentless and doom-laden, like thecomment section.Through her closed bedroom door a figure appeared, and the blue TV light crackled and leapt as though it cried: “I know him Nick Timothy’s ghost!”The same beardy face, the same name. The chain her former special adviser drew was clasped about his middle and dragged bundles of newspapers.“But Nick,” May whimpered, cowering, “you’re in chains.”“It is required of every man,” Timothy replied, “thatthey are not self-aware in le, then it is condemned to be after death.”The spectre raised a cry and shook its columns. “I wear the chain I made in Downing Street,” it said “I made it line by line, blame by shted blame.“I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate,” Timothy went on. “You will be haunted by Three Spirits.”May awoke with a start, but before she could convince herself it was a dream, light flashed and the curtains of her bed were drawn. She found herself before a strange figure, with a face like child, yet not so like a child as like an old man.“David,” she said, recognising her predecessor. “Are you a spirit, too ”“I am the Ghost of Brexit Past,” David Cameron intoned. “Yours, thankfully, not mine.”She took him by the hand and the pair flew into the past, alighting first at a  meeting with Goldman Sachs bankers, where she warned Brexit would deter investment in the UK, then to a speech where she warned of the risks to EU-wide security cooperation.: Jeremy Corbyn to table no confidence motion in PMBrexit vote date not setOn to her first Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, where she said “Citizens of the World” were really “Citizens of Nowhere”, and then back to Downing Street. “Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon your cheek ” For this was where May called an election accusing the EU of undermining Brexit, then lost her majority.May awoke for a second time, and found her bedroom filled from top to bottom with angry men in suits, discussing in the most extravagant and overflowing terms exactly how they were going to dispose of her. “Come in!” exclaimed the weird and not-at-all-jolly giant presiding over the European Research Group. “I am the Ghost of Brexit Present, and we’re going to feed you into a wood chipper.”Issuing bloody threats all the while, the spirit showed May ordinary families ruining their Christmas dinners with arguments about Europe, plotting MPs, fruit crops rotting in polytunnels, and more angry figures in yellow vests shouting about betrayal.“All this is possible thanks to you isn’t it great ” the Ghost said. “Can’t wait to boil you in a pot.”And suddenly, he was gone. Lting up her eyes, May beheld a solemn phantom, draped and hooded, coming towards her like a mist along the ground that has somehow managed not to be sacked. “Jeremy ” she asked. “But you’re a Remainer!” Jeremy Hunt answered not, but gave a hooded, sepulchral shrug.“Ghost of Brexit that is Yet to Come!” May exclaimed. “I fear you more than any spectre I have seen.” And truly, the sights of no-deal Brexit Britain chilled May to the bone.She was transported back to her Commons office, but behind her desk Prime Minister Tom Tugendhat had his head in his hands. His government of national unity, formed in the wake of splits in the two main parties, was collapsing. Amid a stack of resignation letters were demands from Nicola Sturgeon for a Section  order, and calls from Sinn Fein for a border poll in Northern Ireland.In the streets, protesters gathered round skips filled with burning copies of David Cameron’s memoirs for warmth. There were no negotiations with the EU Brussels was in chaos since the far right surged in European elections. Nor was President Pence in a position to offer a trade deal, what with the legal trouble.The spectre took May to conflicts in Ukraine and Yemen, where the UK had given up any pretence of exerting its influence. And they visited China, which continued to suck up production and jobs as the West dismantled the world trade system it had designed. Actually, they went to Japan first before Hunt worked out his mistake.“Good spirit,” May cried when she had seen these things “Assure me that I may yet change these shadows. I will live in the past, present and future. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach!”She awoke with a start again, and knew things were dferent. Flinging open the window of Number , she made a series of unnatural jerking movements, like a jostled shop mannequin about to topple over.“But darling,” cried her husband Philip, “you’re dancing with joy! And only last night you were so despondent.”Beaming, she turned to him. “I know what I have to do.”: Brexit: There’s only one way out of this screw-up – Christine Jardine©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845913.1545206611!/image/image.jpg","title":"how home office is blocking glasgow s efforts to provide true asylum martyn mclaughlin","story":"The Home Office#s intransigent approach to providing housing for asylum seekers is causing anger and mistrust across the country, writes Martyn McLaughlin.Anyone who has paid attention to the Home Office’s thoughtless and negligent approach to housing asylum seekers over the past decade will not be unduly surprised by the latest damning report from the Home Affairs Select Committee.The most obvious question to draw from its primary conclusion – that local authorities across the UK are experiencing a crisis of trust in a broken system – is quite simple. What took so long Britain’s dispersal policy has been unfit for purpose for years. The Home Office’s existing ‘Compass’ contract places the responsibility for housing some of society’s most vulnerable iniduals with multinational conglomerates, some of whom had no prior experience in the complex asylum housing sector. In Glasgow, where Serco has been widely criticised, there have been numerous examples of the initiative’s folly: families forced to reside in properties ridden with vermin and damp, or which lacked essentials such as window panes and heating. Serco’s plan the change the locks on the properties of asylum seekers earlier this summer sparked widespread protests and a legal challenge. Charities and NGOs forced to pick up the pieces have been some of the fiercest critics of Compass, but the new report, published on Monday, shows that councils are fast catching up. With confidence in the entire process waning, MPs have warned that the entire system could soon become untenable.“Nearly two years after our previous report, very little has improved and mistrust by local authorities of central Government has deepened,” the committee noted. “The Government’s handling of the replacement for Compass has led dispersal authorities to consider withdrawal from participation in the dispersal scheme.”In truth, the use of the word replacement is a tad disingenuous renewal would a far more fitting descriptor, given the UK Government looks set to plough ahead with issuing decade-long Asylum Accommodation and Support Servicescontracts. The acronym may be new, but it is Compass in all but name.: Insight: Asylum seekers at breaking point as trauma takes its toll on mental healthThe dissatisfaction over the dispersal scheme is most keenly felt in Yorkshire, but it is proving contagious. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, recently wrote to Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, detailing his misgivings regarding oversight of the dispersal contract, and underlining the need for a fairer distribution of asylum arrivals across the country. Emphasising the gravity of the problems, Mr Burnham warned him that Manchester’s ten local authorities were now “seriously considering” their continued participation in the scheme. Fortunately, especially for the ,-plus asylum seekers in Scotland’s biggest city, Glasgow City Council is not inclined to follow suit. It was one of the first cities in the UK after London to join the dispersal scheme and for nearly  years, it has taken great pride in its participation.The city, in turn, has benefited immeasurably. In the space of a generation, its communities and culture have been enriched and Glasgow’s reputation as a welcoming city has been enhanced. The SNP administration knows this only too well, and it is keen to continue with the dispersal programme,not the precise arrangements put in place by the Home Office. When Glasgow first became part of the initiative, it was the city council itself which was the contract holder. All these years later, and in light of the disastrous Compass contract, the council was minded to take over the reins for AASC. : Brian Wilson: Serco right about one thing in asylum seeker eviction rowAfter making a formal expression of interest, it received a -page form from the Home Office, designed for organisations with direct experience of providing asylum accommodation in the past ten years. It was, said Susan Aitken, the council leader, “almost impossible for us to answer”.Undeterred, she is among other local authority heads pressing for greater oversight of the new AASC arrangements, albeit to little avail. The Home Office has repeatedly warned that ceding control of property inspections to local authorities, for example, would compromise its ability to hold accommodation providers to account. It is a claim as laughable as it is absurd. Such is the Home Office’s commitment to ensuring that asylum housing is fit for purpose, it employs the grand total of nine contract compliance officers, responsible for assessing , dispersal accommodationproperties across the UK. A single officer is based in Glasgow.The workload they are able to carry out has produced some damning conclusions. Between March  and January this year, for example, less than a quarter of those properties inspected were found to be compliant with the requirements of the Compass contract. Close to halfwere deemed not fit for purpose. A separate inspection report carried out earlier this year by David Bolt, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that the Home Office inspection regime was essentially a system of spot checks, which were neither informed by intelligence, nor subject to follow-up inspections. The Home Office has shown itself to be unable,not unwilling, to ensure some of Scotland’s most marginalised and vulnerable people are given proper shelter. If it is allowed to steamroll through its plans for AASC with no meaningful changes, we will all be the poorer for it.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845818.1545206166!/image/image.jpg","title":"why birmingham may be a role model for scottish cities chris mccall","story":"After three months in Birmingham, Chris McCall says the rebirth of UK#s second largest conurbation could have lessons for Scotland#s cities.Their faces said it all. It was a look of slight surprise crossed with mild concern. I had told them I was moving to Birmingham. Whether it was friends, family or colleagues, they struggled to see the appeal of le in the UK’s second largest city.I would explain I was moving for a three-month work secondment. It was too good an opportunity to turn down. I planned to travel home to Glasgow most weekends. Exploring a new city would be fun.“The only thing I know about Birmingham is there are a lot of motorways,” was a typical response. It had that in common with my home town, I thought. Here was another place that had been determined to bulldoze its way to post-war prosperity. Unlike Scotland’s biggest city, Brum held its nerve and built not one but two ring roads – instead of the half-finished mess inflicted on Charing Cross and Tradeston.But what did I really know about this sprawling metropolis  That the car was king, of course. Millions of them were built there and thousands of properties had been cleared to make way for the roads its new car-owning society demanded. Birmingham was the UK’s Motown – but with a much heavier musical legacy Iron Maiden never wrote cutesy soul songs.“Birmingham’s name is known everywhere,” the broadcaster Jonathan Meades observed two decades ago. “But its people aren’t, and nor is their city which is in the middle of England and is Middle England. It’s hyperbolically typical of England, yet at the same time it’s hermetic – it’s an ignored voice in the heart of the country.”It’s fair to say that downtown Brum is still largely dominated by its roads. Yet it’s gradually moving away from the cult of the automobile towards a more sustainable future which could offer examples for Scotland’s major cities.When I stepped off the train at New Street in September, I was determined I would understand Birmingham by the time I left. I might not grow to love it, I thought, but I would at the very least appreciate what it had to offer.: Alastair Dalton: Failure to curb cars in cities is throttling busesStations can tell us a lot about a place, and the story of New Street tells us more than most. It was once a grand Victorian affair with an Italianate style hotel and a spectacular  canopy designed by Edward Alfred Cowper. It was a terminus that reflected the commercial might of the Midlands.That fine station roof was one of many Brum landmarks to be damaged beyond repair by the Luftwaffe, while the hotel fell victim to British Rail’s west coast mainline modernisation programme of the early s – the same damned project that blighted London’s Euston station. The new New Street was generally despised from the off. Instead of providing a beacon of the future, it condemned passengers to a hideous concrete bunker. A costly refurbishment programme began in . While the s remain subterranean – meaning diesel fumes still linger – the upstairs is now a bold and bright concourse.There’s plenty of space for strangers to find their bearings. “If you think it’s bad now, you should have seen it before,” Brummies say, with characteristic self-deprecation. “Brum will be great when it’s finally finished,” is another line you hear regularly. This is a city with a long record of tearing itself down and trying something dferent.The New Street rebuild is just one of several ambitious local projects. The redeveloped Bullring shopping centre boasts a Selfridges, the high-end department store long coveted by Glasgow. The city’s modern tram network is currently being extended with little of the fuss seen in Edinburgh.: Kevin Buckle: Edinburgh’s lost railway could be restoredHere I was, privileged to be witnessing the rebirth of one of the UK’s major cities in real time. Unlike in Dundee, which has chosen to take the Bilbao route of hanging its international appeal on an eye-catching museum, Birmingham has opted to get the basics right. If you can offer numerous decent shops and a gleaming station, visitors will soon follow.For a city with a long association with the car, it’s investing substantial amounts in public transport. Its suburban rail network has been continuously growing for years. Then there’s the small matter of HS, the eye-wateringly expensive infrastructure project – or colossal folly, depending on your viewpoint – which will link Birmingham with London via a new high-speed rail line.In comparison, it strikes me that Scotland’s two biggest cities seem incapable of sorting out public transport in their own backyards. Edinburgh’s buses are the best outside of London but the capital seems uninterested in reopening its extensive network of suburban railways to passengers. The less said about the tram system, the better.Glasgow, meanwhile, boasts dozens of stations yet is stuck with a bus network that’s grimly tolerated at best. Its own plans for a tram system bit the dust  years ago and have never seriously been reconsidered.Brummies would be the first to tell you their city isn’t perfect. Among other things, it lacks any instantly recognisble landmarks to entice visitors. The council hopes its flash public library, opened in , is becoming one. The -storey building positively screams modern civic ambition.I looked beyond these modern developments whenever I felt the dull ache of home sickness. I was fortunate to stay a short distance from the Birmingham and Worcester canal, one of two major waterways built in the Georgian era. If you enjoy a stroll along a quiet towpath, Birmingham is your place. It’s one of the few parts of the city you’re guaranteed not see any cars.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4839780.1545148224!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian blackford told go back to skye by tory mp","story":"The SNP leader at Westminster was reportedly told #go back to the Isle of Skye# as he stood to speak at an emergency Commons debate on Brexit.Ian Blackford was in the chamber for the EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate today when the comment was shouted, with several MPs quickly pointing the finger of blame at veteran Conservative member Sir Nicholas Soames.It provoked a furious reaction from senior Nationalists.

It was said to have been inspired by the waterfront in her native Boston, where she and husband Ted Hughes were living when she wrote the poem.The couple had moved to London by the time her pamphlet was published in  by Anderson’s one-man Tragara Press outfit, after Plath had been impressed by proofs he had sent her.Anderson ended up publishing Plath’s poem after initially writing to Hughes to express his admiration about his work.After being sent samples showing how the poem would appear in print, Plath wrote to Anderson, telling him: “I am writing on my own behalf to say how delighted my husband and I were with the proofs of A Winter Ship. I’m sending back the one we like best, with the border round it. “We thought we’d like the date, place and press in upright letters, as on the other proof, and my name deleted – as I’ll write that on the inside myself, with Christmas greetings too.”The National Library hopes the acquisition of the poem will raise greater awareness of Anderson, who was still operating his printing press at his home in the Highlands shortly before he died in  at the age of .Born in Fe in , he started his working le as a banker and took up a post with an antiquarian bookseller in Edinburgh after serving in the Royal Navy, before buying his own bookshop.Anderson would go on to publish an anthology of work by Barry Humphries, the Australian writer and actor best known for creating the character Dame Edna Everage.Graham Hogg, rare books curator at the National Library, said: “Alan Anderson had a private press so he just did what he wanted and when he wanted. He wasn’t actively going out and touting for work. He was never in it for the money – it was a hobby and a passion for him.“Alan Anderson mostly published small pamphlets for contemporary poets that he was interested in. He only really printed work that he liked or work for friends.“This particular one came about when he wrote to Ted Hughes to say how impressed he was by a short story he had written and askedhe had anything  and would be happy to print it. Ted Hughes wrote back to him and said that his we was writing poetry and askedhe could publish something. I doubt any money would have changed hands at all. They were never intended for public sale. “It’s very much a curio as she actually sent them out in their Christmas cards. He had sent her two proof copies and she chose the one she liked.”Born in Boston in , Plath met Hughes in  when she was studying at Cambridge University and they married a few months later. However, they had a tempestuous relationship and after Hughes met another woman in  he split with Plath, who had been troubled with mental illness for years.

The Scottish Government responded by announcing it was looking at new routes to bring in supplies of medicines and other essentials in case the flow of goods through Calais and other main ports breaks down.Last night the SNP joined other opposition parties in lodging a motion of no confidence in the Government. It came after the Labour Party stopped short of formally seeking a vote to try and collapse the Government.The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused Jeremy Corbyn of wasting time on a “gimmick”, although the joint effort with the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Greens is unlikely to be granted parliamentary \u2028time for debate by the Government.“It is clear the Prime Minister’s tactic has been to run down the clock and deprive Parliament of any alternative to her deal,” Mr Blackford said.“Jeremy Corbyn seems happy to let her – presumably to avoid having to make a decision on a second EU referendum.“We want this motion to succeed, butit doesn’t Labour’s only excuse for not backing a second referendum will be removed.“Either way,the official opposition won’t do its job, the real opposition will.”At a marathon cabinet meeting yesterday that saw  ministers give their views, it was agreed to implement all the Government’s no-deal plans despite bitter isions over whether leaving the EU without a deal would be acceptable.Several ministers are understood to have signalled they would resign in the event of a no-deal, including work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, who is reported to have told colleagues: “Just because you put a seat belt on, it doesn’t mean you should crash the car.”In the House of Commons, defence secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs that , soldiers would be put on standby to assist in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Civil servants will work through Christmas on preparations, Downing Street revealed.A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: “Cabinet agreed that with just over three months until our exit from the European Union, we have now reached the point where we need to ramp up these preparations.“This means we will now set in motion the remaining elements of our no-deal plans.“Citizens should also prepare in line with the technical notices issued in the summer and in line with further more detailed advice that will now be issued over the coming weeks.”A £bn no-deal contingency fund will be handed out to the Home Office, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and other Whitehall departments.Emails will be sent to , businesses that are particularly vulnerable to the potential imposition of customs duties and regulatory checks, highlighting official advice.Food supplies could be hit, with price rises affecting the poorest in society, Scotland’s Brexit secretary Michael Russell told MSPs in a Holyrood statement.The Scottish Government activated its own emergency resilience response measures, while the police are preparing for “civil contingencies”.Mr Russell warned a no-deal scenario would cause “irreparable damage” to the country and society. The Scottish Government, including Transport Scotland, is working with ports and other parts of the supply chain to “fully assess the impact and identy what can be done to mitigate disruption”, he said yesterday.He added: “It’s our aim to secure the best flow of essential goods into Scotland using existing routes or developing new ones.”Plans are also being developed to deal with the supply of medicines, medical devices and the workforce for health and social care.Mr Russell insisted a “no-deal Brexit” was not yet inevitable. But he said: “As a responsible Government, we cannot wait any longer. The consequences and risks are too pressing and too severe.“The Scottish Government is ready to operate Brexit arrangements at very short notice, but will continue to build preparedness and resilience.”Mr Russell added: “Whilst this government will do everything we can to prepare, we must not let anyone believe we can do everything.“The nebulous approach of the UK Government to decision making on Brexit has meant that it is impossible to know when these plans might need to go into effect.”Labour’s shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said it was testament to the Government’s “failure” in talks with the EU that was “spending billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to prepare for a no-deal Brexit that is rejected by Parliament and many of those sat around the Cabinet table”.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the decision to ramp up no-deal preparations was “psychological warfare”.“The Conservative Government are attempting to scare MPs, businesses and the public with the threat of a no-deal,” Mr Cable said.l With additional reporting by Scott Macnab©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845414.1545125375!/image/image.jpg","title":"wood powers up with sellafield nuclear work","story":"Wood, the Aberdeen-headquartered energy and engineering services giant, has continued its strong run of contract wins with a  milliondeal to supply kit for the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria.The major ten-year contract will be seen as a further endorsement of the group’s acquisition of Amec Foster Wheeler, which was undertaken last year and has led to strong revenue synergies.Wood said its latest deal covers all stages of system design, manufacture and assembly of equipment, obsolescence management and maintenance support to project work and decommissioning carried out by the company that oversees Sellafield.The contract was secured by a joint approach from nuclear and automation and controls specialists within Wood, which operates in more than  countries and employs some , people globally.Bob MacDonald, chief executive of Wood Specialist Technical Solutions, said: “We are looking forward to working with Sellafield Limited and demonstrating the strength and depth of controls integration expertise across the whole of Wood, bringing together our nuclear expertise with our automation and controls capability.“Securing this important framework is proof of the rationale for acquiring Amec Foster Wheeler  months ago and a good revenue synergy.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too.

I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from -

Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated.

AndEamonn Higgins of Hot Milk Forge has his way, the skills of yesteryear will be passed down to future generations - thanks in part to global TV hit ‘Game of Thrones’ with its sword and sorcery primetime magic. Hot Milk Forge is a Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing School based on the Lisnamanny Road in Ballymena.It runs evening, weekend and day classes in Basic to Advanced Artist Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing and people have been travelling to the courses from all over the world.Speaking to the Ballymena , Eamonn said he loves teaching his craft to keen and intrigued novices.I have been a professional artist and sculptor since .For  years Blacksmithing has formed an integral part of my practice with public works scattered across the UK and commercial works collected internationally, Eamonn explained.However I love taking the courses and teaching people a new skill, something they wouldnt ever experience.The -year-old said he recently had a lady travel all the way from Kerry to make her own unique creations.This woman drove a long way to do the course and she made a number of intricate brooches and pieces of art that she can treasure.I have many people that sign up to the course who are big fans of Game of Thrones and TV shows like that but a lot of people just want to try something dferent, Eamonn said.At the minute we are making mostly knives which seems to be the trendy item at the minute.“This has probably come from the huge interest in Game of Thrones.”Eamonn has been approached by the HBO series to make specic items for the show and has had many of the actors who appeared on the show taking his courses.Hot Milk Forge offers evening and Weekend Classes in Blacksmithing with an artistic twist. Evening classes are open to everyone above the age of . Participants are encouraged to learn the traditional skills not just because the celebration of wrought iron work is a worthy idea but also because only blacksmithing can introduce you to the full potential of steel as a creative medium. At the forge they weld with a fire and not with electricity. Imagine making your own fire side set, wrought iron gate, gts for your partner, sculpture, the list goes on.FAMILY FARMHot Milk Forge is located on Eamonns family farm and the workshop is where the first milking parlour was located many moons ago. His childhood years growing up surrounded by natural beauty of the nearby Antrim Hills continue to influence his work which often looks primeval, resembling the misshapen bodies of humans and animals miraculously preserved in Irish bogs for thousands of years. I try to give my work a certain austerity, a terrible beauty that is timeless and that can be associated with Irish art through the millennia. “As I come from a rural background, the landscape and its people speak more to me than some of the more conceptual art in vogue. “As a child I grew up playing in mud in haystacks and running about the fields. “I absorbed all of this subconsciously and it comes out in my work.”Eamonn has been demonstrating and teaching blacksmithing as part of his Public Art practice as long as he has been blacksmithing.In  on completion of a two year artist residency in the University of Ulster Eamonn decided it was time his blacksmithing classes had a permanent home Hot Milk Forge was born.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

Our business and domestic rate payers deserve it. “It is imperative that we invest in our town centres to make them a vibrant and attractive place to live, work, shop and do business.”, Emma Harrison, Pearl Sibanda and Lauren Graham with Anne Kerr from the British Psychology Society and Mrs L Duke .\"  , Emma Harrison, Pearl Sibanda and Lauren Graham with Anne Kerr from the British Psychology Society and Mrs L Duke .\"  Pupils investigate the ‘Power of Unorm’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8743676.1545132650!/image/image.jpg","title":"annual tea dance success","story":"Southern Regional College, Banbridge Campus held its annual Tea Dance on Wednesday, December .

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list.

I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"christmas in comfort at clonard","story":"CLONARD parishioners will be able to enjoy their Christmas Mass even more this year as the traditional hard wooden pews have been consigned to the past. In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new report lays out bright future for west belfast","story":"A NEW report detailing the positive transformation that has taken place in West Belfast in recent years will be launched on tomorrow morning . ‘Vision : Transforming West Belfast’ will look to the future as well as outlining projects such as the James Connolly Interpretive Centre, Casement Park and the Roddy McCorley Society interactive museum and visitor centre.The report has been commissioned by Fáilte Feirste Thiar and the West Belfast Partnership Board and will highlight the amount of investment that has gone into the West of the city.Projects in the spotlight in the report include:•£m from Belfast City Council for the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre•m from the Department for Communities and Ciste for Áras na BhFál• £m for the Balmoral Hotel•£.m for the Blackmountain Shared Space Project•£m investment for Brook Leisure Centre•£m for the Falls Park City Cemetery MasterplanIn total, the report will list  projects in West Belfast that have benefited from investment.Speaking to the Andersonstown News ahead of the launch, Harry Connolly, Executive Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, said: “In recent years West Belfast has began to secure increased amounts of public sector investment.“Research undertaken for this publication has uncovered that this combined investment totals over £ million – a signicant figure.“Many people involved in our local private, public and community sectors will not be fully aware of the huge amount of work involved nor the scale of the investment secured. The Vision : Transforming West Belfast publication captures, articulates and plots out in a user-friendly format the depth of investment, the impact of this investment and, importantly, a timetable for delivery.“Only projects that have been secured are showcased. Vision : will act as a catalyst in helping to leverage further investment.”Jim Girvan, Operations Director with the West Belfast Partnership Board, said: “West Belfast has seen transformational change over the past twenty years with its buildings, structure, style and landscape, and we want to encourage this growth in partnership with local communities.“West Belfast is an amazing place where people have business accolades and creative solutions, which creates the perfect place for people to live, work, invest, visit and enjoy.”Welcoming the launch of the report, MP for West Belfast Paul Maskey added: “As MP for this constituency I have the privilege of having knowledge of all of these projects and an appreciation of the sheer volume of effort and dedication that goes into making each and every one of these projects a success.“I am of the firm belief that Vision : is only the beginning, the first phase and perhaps the most important, of a tangible transformation in West Belfast that puts local people central to development and builds a unique model that allows our resilience and spirit to grow.”Vision : Transforming West Belfast will be launched on Friday, December , at .am in An Chultúrlann, Falls Road."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"oap summonsed for feeding the horses","story":"A WEST Belfast animal lover is calling on Belfast City Council to drop their case against him after he received a littering summons for feeding horses in a field.Ballymurphy man Seamus Conlon was feeding a friend’s horses in a field on the Hannahstown Hill in June of this year when he was approached by two men who asked him to stop what he was doing.Seamus says he told the men to mind their own business but later received a fixed penalty fine in the post which he refused to pay. He’s now been issued with a summons and was due to appear in court on Wednesday morning – but the hearing was adjourned for the second time.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, a gobsmacked Seamus said: “I’ve kept horses all my le, they are beautul creatures. I am in poor health and looking after these horses brings me a real sense of joy.”Seamus lives with COPD, is diabetic and has suffered multiple heart attacks.He continued: “I was giving bread to the horses, minding my own business, and these two characters approached me and demanded I stopped. This field belongs to my friend and I have permission to feed these horses. What harm was I doing  I don’t need the stress and strain of this.”Seamus described the encounter that led to the series of events that has left him baffled and angry.“I pulled my car up that morning and walked over to feed the horses, these two fellas shouted over at me and told me to stop. I told them to take themselves off, they said they were ringing the peelers and I told them to get whoever they wanted. One of the men said the birds were lting the bread I was feeding the horses and dropping it in his garden, absolute nonsense. I got into my car and drove off. Your man must have taken my car registration because I received a fixed penalty notice in the post.”Seamus added: “I turned up to court on the arranged date and the complainant never bothered turning up. I showed up again on Tuesday and the same thing, he never weighed in again. NowI didn’t bother turning up I’m sure they’d have something to say about that. This is a complete and utter waste of Belfast City Council time and money and I am urging them to drop it.”Local People Before Profit Councillor Matt Collins said: “This whole situation is ridiculous, whoever made the decision to issue a court summons to Seamus perhaps needs a basic crash course in what constitutes illegal or criminal behaviour. This summons should be withdrawn and Belfast City Council should apologise to Seamus immediately.“It’s also worth saying that Seamus is taking this in his stride and isn’t backing down – and fair play to him for that. But other people would likely be intimidated by this. Nobody wants brought up in front of a court and especially for something so absurd. I’d imagine the vast majority of people would agree with me that Belfast City Council and the powers-that-be in this city ought to put their time and energy into something more productive, instead of hauling a pensioner up in front of a court for feeding horses.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said that as this is an ongoing matter they would not be making any comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chris moncrieff whether youre a leaver or a remainer a second poll would be a betrayal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is true whether you are a Remainer or a Leaver. Parliament ordained the referendum and, at the same time, gave a solemn promise that they’d abide by the result..pushThe fact politicians have got themselves in such a mess trying to implement the referendum result in favour of quitting the EU cannot ever be used as an excuse for defaulting on the original undertaking.To her eternal credit, the Prime Minister refuses to bow to the clamour for a second referendum.She hit out at Tony Blair, accusing him of “insulting” the British people and the office of Prime Minister by “undermining” Brexit talks with calls in Brussels for a second referendum.In a pointed swipe at the Labour heavyweight, the Prime Minister said a second referendum would amount to parliament abdicating responsibility.Mrs May said: “For Tony Blair to go to Brussels and seek to undermine our negotiations by advocating for a second referendum is an insult to the office he once held and the people he once served. We cannot, as he would, abdicate responsibility for this decision.“Parliament has a democratic duty to deliver what the British people voted for. I remain determined to see that happen. I will not let the British people down.”The trouble is that the people who really matter — the great British electorate — are being fobbed off with contradictory stories about what is going on behind the scenes. Some are insisting that the Cabinet is involved in its own civil war about whether to have a second referendum, while others insist this is completely untrue.Meanwhile, those calling for another poll are claiming that those who voted for the UK to leave the EU did not appreciate what this would involve.How patronising. Of course, most people realised that the EU negotiating team would try to squeeze every drop of blood out of the UK in what has approached the level of bullying the Prime Minister partly, no doubt, to frighten any other member states which might be considering following in the UK’s footsteps.It’s asthe elitists simply assume — arrogantly — that they know better than the people they are supposed to serve .Some of the reasons given by those demanding another referendum are bizarre — to put it mildly. Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said the Remain campaign during the original referendum fell far short of even being effective.Well, that is laughable and is no reason for going to the polls again.The simple truth is that the British voters, on both sides of the argument, deserve better of their politicians than this.n Theresa May is fighting her corner against a stubborn and obdurate team of negotiators in Brussels, who are finding her a much tougher opponent than they’d probably expected.But there are those who would like to see a little more drama and aggression on the part of the UK team.In similar circumstances, Margaret Thatcherwould thump the table and brandish her famous handbag, frightening the lives out of the Brussels team.Theresa May cannot match that — but she is adamant not to surrender and is to be commended for that.But what is urgently required is some kind of magic to sort out the shambles in the House of Commons, where at the moment getting a majority on anything appears to be a major problem.Somehow, all this has to be resolved and the Leavers get what they voted for in the referendum in a fair and honourable way. n When all this is over, major surgery will be required to restore the shattered Conservative Party back to rude health. It may well take a new leader to do that.As you might expect, the usual suspects, like Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt , have both indicated they will be in the running.But in politics, it is often not the obvious names who get the crown.Has anyone thought of David Lidington — the quiet man who is Theresa May’s de facto number two  He is the dark horse to watch.But there is going to be a lot more discord before that position is reached."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37640606.ece/c8780/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Brexit-donor.jpg","title":"435k brexit donation to dup not reported to","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There was no provision of washing liquid for dishes.\"The issues were uncovered by the RQIA two weeks after the Commissioner for Older People heavily criticised Runwood Homes for failing to invest properly to ensure a safe service at Dunmurry Manor.Eddie Lynchs report revealed relatives of Dunmurry Manor residents had to buy continence pads for their loved ones, because the standard of the products provided by Runwood Homes was so poor.It emerged that staff had to buy their own blood pressure monitors, because all the monitors provided by Runwood Homes were broken. The minutes also highlighted that staff shortages at Clton Nursing Home were impacting on their ability to do their work to the best of their ability.On the first day of the inspection, the home was short of three care staff.The minutes said: \"It was tangible that this was having a direct impact on patient care, including patients still waiting to have their morning needs attended to at .am.\"In addition, patients were observed to be left unattended in the dining room at lunch and were observed to have their meals sitting in front of them without staff available to provide assistance.\" Domestic staff also revealed that effective decontamination of previously occupied bedrooms was not being completed and deep cleans of bedrooms were not happening.The minutes continued: \"Domestic staff advised that they had not been completing their documentation and schedules as they had refused to falsy documentation to reflect that work had been completed when it hadnt.

Labour will try to force Brexit vote before Christmas  Bertie Ahern: Ireland cant give an inch on avoiding hard border  Blair: May is irresponsible to try and steamroller her deal through The routes are understood to include country lanes, private roads, rights of way across private lands and other unmarked access points leading into Northern Ireland that could be potential smuggling routes.The highly sensitive work was conducted by members of the Defence Forces, working with gardai. It involved physical mapping of the Border by army personnel along with desk-top work and was completed in recent months.Defence Forces are in continual mapping of Irelands Border for security purposes, such as during the Foot  Mouth disease outbreak  years ago The latest exercise is regarded as particularly signicant in light of the potential security risks posed by Brexit.The updated map of the frontier will form a key part of the security services contingency planning for a doomsday scenario that could follow Britain plunging out of the EU without a deal.The last official report on the Border identied  official crossing points. That report was published jointly in July by the Department of Transport, Tourism  Sport and the Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.However, it highlighted only public roadways along the Border that stretches from Donegal to Antrim and did not include any private roads or laneways.The Defence Forces work has highlighted scores of private crossing points, some of which could be vulnerable to criminality in the event of a hard border. The Irish Armys Border mapping work can be viewed in the context of the security risks posed by Brexit, which were outlined in stark detail at a cross-border crime conference last month.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the conference that dissidents would \"undoubtedly\" attempt to exploit a hard border as \"something they wish to rally around\".\" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks But the conference was also warned that even a soft Brexit could lead to challenges with increases in cross-border smuggling of all kinds, including people trafficking, cigarette and alcohol smuggling and fuel laundering. The conference was told that pc of cross-border gangs are highly mobile and operate on both sides of the Border.Previous security assessments have identied  criminal gangs dominating cigarette smuggling on both sides of the Border. The Governments position is that there must be noto a hard border.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that the Government has no contingency plans in place for policing the Border in the event of a hard Brexit.However, he said the Government does \"have regard for the fact that we could see an increase in smuggling and other illegal cross-border activities\".In a statement to the Sunday Independent, the Defence Forces said: \"In the normal course, Oglaigh na hEireann carry out analysis and background research into contingencies. This would include viable border crossings. In the context of security, any research in relation to the border or otherwise is internal to Oglaigh na hEireann.\"A statement from An Garda Siochana this weekend said they \"have been and will continue to review the policing issues relating to Brexit. This has included regular liaison with our counterparts in Northern Ireland. However, without a final political settlement, it is not yet clear what the specic impacts on policing will be.\"\"Regardless of the final political settlement, our long-standing strong working relationship with the PSNI will continue in order to protect and support communities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"may promises further talks with eu to get assurances on backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They are contained in the conclusions of yesterday evening.“That is our position. That is what we have put on the table. And now we expect Great Britain to respond.”Belgium’s PM Charles Michel said: “The ball is now politically in the British court.”And Mr Tusk said he had “no mandate” to organise any further negotiations.Mrs May’s hopes of a legally binding commitment on the backstop from the EU were dashed on Thursday, when Mr Juncker said there could be “no real changes” to the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated over  months.It seems that the Prime Minister has failed in her bid to deliver meaningful changes to her Brexit deal. We cannot go on like this. The Prime Minister should reinstate the vote on her deal next week and let Parliament take back control.— Keir StarmerDecember , The Prime Minister addressed the EU leaders on Thursday about MPs’ concerns  about the backstop which had prevented her getting her Brexit deal through Parliament this week.Mr Tusk said the leaders had expressed a “firm determination” to work “speedily” to ensure there is an agreement on the future relationship in place by the time the transition period ends in December , so the backstop is not needed.But Mr Juncker criticised Britain’s lack of clarity over what it was seeking from the future relationship.“Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want,” he said.“So we would like, within a few weeks, our UK friends to set out their expectations for us because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarications.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker embraces council president Donald Tusk at the Brussels summit The EU hardball approach appears to leave Mrs May with limited room for manoeuvre during the countdown to the UK’s departure on March .The Prime Minister told the summit that a package of assurances around the backstop could “change the dynamic” at Westminster.At the same time, she made clear a failure by EU leaders to offer concessions risked the collapse of the whole agreement, with the UK leaving in March in a disorderly, no-deal Brexit.Mrs May managed a smile at her press conference when a reporter askedshe had had a “trying week”, jokingly replying: “Has something happened this week ”When asked whether the problems with her party at home and dealing with the EU had made her want to quit as leader, she said it is “our duty as a Government and as a Parliament” to see Brexit through.WATCH LIVE: PM @Theresa_May holds a press conference following EU Council https:t.co irtqNcSv— UK Prime MinisterDecember , She added: “I never said it was going to be easy.“Negotiations like this are always tough. There are always dficult times and as you get closer to the very end, that can get even more dficult because you are sorting out the last details of something.”Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May’s plan was “dead in the water” after she “utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes”, and reiterated Labour’s call for it to be put to a vote before Christmas.PM @Theresa_May has met leaders including @donaldtusk and @Xavier_Bettel at @EUCouncil today and discussed what is needed to get the Brexit deal over the line pic WMInAvAJkj— UK Prime MinisterDecember , Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington rejected that idea and defended Mrs May’s handling of the talks, telling Today: “Anybody who has heard Theresa May in debate, anybody who has heard her around the Cabinet table, knows there is a very clear plan.”He described the talks as “a welcome first step that was the removal of uncertainty” over the EU’s intentions, because it has shown it wants a “speedy UK trade deal” that would remove the need for the backstop in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"mays postbrexit trade deal suggestion dismissed by taoiseach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ozzie was admitted on October  to AE and by the following morning our lives changed forever when we were given the diagnosis.\"Ozzies chemotherapy lasted for  days. But his leukaemia did not respond as well as hoped. He suffered a fungal infection in his lungs, sickness and constant temperatures. He has also suffered moderate heart damage and lost kg in weight.\"The chemotherapy had taken its toll on him physically and mentally but Ozzie has finished his second round of chemo and I feel he has turned a corner within himself,\" his mother said.\"On Christmas Eve he will be having a bone marrow aspiration and lumbar puncture to check how his bone marrow is and then the next pathway will be determined, prepping him for a bone marrow transplant in Bristol some time in the New Year.\"Heather Thornton said: \"Ozzie is a very important member of our club and we really wanted to do something to help him. We are delighted that not one but two donors have been found for Ozzie and, who knows, maybe one of the people who signed up on Saturday will get a call to say their bone marrow is a match for someone, somewhere.\""},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts po sailing updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Queens University has said it will consider how this will affect Union Colleges future and that it will help those who have applied to study in  find alternative courses.A spokesperson for UTC called the review findings \"very speculative and totally unsubstantiated\".\"We very much regret and are disappointed by the decision taken,\" they said.They said suggesting that students had not been exposed to a breadth of theological perspectives contradicted reports from external examiners in theology for many years.The spokesperson added it was not by choice that Union College had become the sole provider of undergraduate degree programmes after three other theological colleges - the Methodist Edgehill College, Irish Baptist College and Belfast Bible College - no longer offered courses.\"As to why Northern Irelands three other theological colleges found themselves unable to work with Queens University is, of course, an open question,\" they said.\"Is the real issue that there is no place for a Christian college linked to the Queens University of today \"DUP MLA Christopher Stalford voiced his support on Twitter. \"Union is a fine college which has produced many great thinkers, preachers and lecturers. This is Queens loss,\" he said.The latest decision follows a previous review in  which raised similar issues. Its believed a key factor in the latest review was a decision to suspend a theology professor for comments in the media.Laurence Kirkpatrick had described Union College as an \"exclusively Presbyterian male teaching faculty,\" and that: \"Id be broken-heartedanyone said Id been bigoted against a Catholic or gay student.\" His comments followed a controversial decision by the Presbyterian General Assembly to deny anyone in a same-sex relationship to be a full communicant member of the Church or have their children baptised."},{"url":null,"title":"sir trevor mcdonald returns to belfasts europa hotel 45 years after his first","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is now imposing severe and often highly questionable cuts in key quotas right at the point when an already challenging discard ban comes into full force.“Despite the abundance of local fish stocks, Shetland’s fishermen and fishing communities are to be punished by distant bureaucrats who are utterly obsessed with unworkable rules.“The Scottish fisheries minister and his team have been a strong voice for our industry throughout these talks, but the CFP ensures that the European Commission can mismanage fisheries at will and other countries can gang up to harvest more of the natural resources around our shores than we can. This has to end.”"},{"url":null,"title":"motorway chargepoint ban urged for hybrid cars","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The latest battery-only cars need just five minutes at the quickest chargepoints to add  miles to their range, compared with an hour for almost all plug-in hybrids to achieve the same benefit. Battery-only cars have no combustion engine, while plug-in hybrids can operate in full electric mode, using conventional fuel or a combination of both. Report author Harold Dermott, who has spent more than  years in the motor manufacturing industry, claimed confusion over how fast dferent electric vehicles can be topped up could undermine efforts to provide an adequate public charging network.

That’s why it’s a little rough around the edges.”Later, Mr Musk emerged from the tunnel himself inside one of his cars before giving a speech to reporters and guests about the technology and why it makes sense.He said: “Traffic is soul-destroying.

He is also a member of Victoria Park and Tower Hamlets AC which won the South of England Athletic Association Fell Running Championships on the Isle of Wight in September, with Aaron winning the inidual title. These championships comprise three races in two days, with the first two races on Saturday and the third and longest, on Sunday.The races are not by any means easy inidually, or collectively, the first being .k, but with an ascent of  metres, the second k with an ascent of  metres and the third, on the following day, k with a m ascent.Aaron was first and second respectively in the first two of the races and he calculated that he could win overallhe finished in fourth place in the third race on Sunday morning.His eventual third place left him overall winner and as he said afterwards: ldquoIt was a beautul setting and some very hard racing, good mental preparation for the XC season coming up. How prophetic that was.To further emphasise his versatility, he ran the Amsterdam Half Marathon on October  and came home in ninth place, posting a superb .. which would have placed him fourth in the recent Belfast Half and sixth in the Waterside Half in Derry, so, he is a top quality runner over all terrains.Juniors at CookstownLauren Madine was the only female from the club juniors to take part in and duly won the U- girlsrsquo race at the Cookstown venue and ever-dependable Mackenzie Murray was the only boy from the club in the U- boysrsquo race, and while he found the going tough, hersquos learning by the week and I am confident that hersquoll develop into a top class runnerFirst points for ladiesEast Down ladies were much better represented than the men as they fielded a team of six and were more than pleased to place fth overall and to register their first place points of the current league campaign.The team scorers were Catherine OrsquoConnor , Niamh Kellett , Deirdre Weatheralland Clare Carsongiving a total of  points. Asto emphasise the importance of overtaking everyone possible, right to the very end, that total was matched by Acorns AC, but because their fourth scorer had finished higher than the East Down fourth-paced runner, Acorns get the better team position.In truth, the third-placed team had only six points less than either Acorns or EDAC, so with a few extra places it could so easily have been third place.

We just set about formalising a programme in earnest back in .ldquoOur programme works so well it is held up as a model for other schools across Northern Ireland to learn from and to embed its principles into their schools.Mr Moore says there is a fundamental dference between shared education and integration.ldquoThe main dference is that each school can hold on to their faith and culture but still be able to reach out in other aspects of the curriculum.ldquoOur parent teacher associations, for example, have been working together for some time. And on other levels we pull our resources too.Mr Moorersquos views were echoed by Mr Paul Coulter, his counterpart at St Patrickrsquos, who said the idea for shared education came from parents at both schools.Mr Coulter said that demand had grown over the years and that the schools were pulling their resources to fund shared experiences, such as educational trips.ldquoWhen you talk to the children you will see that they are really excited about coming together. Many strong friendships have been formed.Mrs Helen McEvoy, Shared Education co-ordinator at St Patrickrsquos, says the programme has given children the opportunity to come together and take part in learning together.She added: ldquoThe vision for the programme is to enhance the learning of all pupils in an environment where there is equal opportunity, good relations and mutual respect fostered, while at the same time acknowledging dferences and celebrating them.The Recorder met children from both schools last Thursday morning when they busy designing a new logo for their Shared Education Programme.Ten year-old Mya McCurry, who attends St Patrickrsquos Primary School, said she wasnrsquot able to see any dferences between pupils and teachers at both schools.ldquoWe started doing this programme when I was in P, she remarked. ldquoI am in P now. Itrsquos really fun and I look forward to having my friends from Ballynahinch Primary School coming here or visiting them at their school.ldquoTo be honest we were friends before we began getting together in school. I would have played with them on our street sometimes. Now we get together in school too and its terric fun.Leon Rose, a P pupil at Ballynahinch Primary School, revealed that taking part in the Shared Education Programme has helped him become less shy.He said: ldquoI enjoy it a lot and we maintain the friendships we make outside of school too.Also taking part in the programme is Patrick Pillitteri, a P pupil at St Patrickrsquos. Eager to reveal the best thing about shared education he said it was the trips they got to go on.He added: ldquoMy favourite trip was to the Kingspan Stadium at Ravenhill. Irsquom not big into rugby but this was something . It was a fabulous big stadium and it holds many thousands.ldquoIrsquom more of a soccer fan myself. I love Liverpool and I donrsquot ever see that changing any time soon. By the way, Liverpool beat Burnley - last night. That may not seem important to you, but it sure is to me.It came as no surprise then to learn that Patrick wants to be a Premier League footballer when he grows up.He said: ldquoIrsquom going to play for Liverpool when Irsquom older. I get lots of practice in with my friends from Ballynahinch Primary. Finlay and Leon are my best friends in this programme.Animal lover Becky Martin is in P at Ballynahinch Primary. She said the best thing about being part of the programme was organising and planing activities together.ldquoWe have been to Castleward, W and, as Patrick has said, we went to the Kingspan Stadium. There have been loads of trips.ldquoI love organising events. Together we agree on what we would like to do and see it through to the end.When asked what she hoped to do when she grew up, she said: ldquoI love animals but being a vet would make me sad. I would have to put animals to sleep and I wouldnrsquot like that. I think I would like to be a professional dog walker or groom dogs and cats when Irsquom older.Becky added: ldquoThe boys and girls from St Patrickrsquos Primary School bring lots of energy with them.

However, we can now look forward to  with a new senior football team management in place, but with no guarantees of success, his report states.ldquoWe have to believe, though, that indeed the corner will be turned and as we look back to  years without inter-county senior success in football, there is surely a catalyst there for players to say they are going to make it happen.Mr McAteer points out that it will take a concerted effort from all involved in the game to get Down challenging for honours again.ldquoIt must come from within us all, players must want to make it happen in their efforts in training and on match days.ldquoAdministrators have to make sure that the environment is right for Down teams to be successful. If both of those two forces can come together then I do believe that we can be successful again.The county secretary believes that the project to develop a county training facility at Ballykinlar is another initiative to be positive about and he hopes that planning permission can be achieved in .ldquoThe hopes of many will take a further step forward early in  as we move to appoint a planning consultant and a design team for our centre at Ballykinlar, he says.ldquoThe past year has been spent being careful to ensure that all of the right steps were being taken hopefully to obtain full planning permission by the end of .While Mr McAteer praises written media within the county and thanks them for their excellent coverage of Gaelic games, he reserves some criticism for TV coverage.He says he is concerned by the coverage provided by the BBC and UTV.ldquoThere is an imbalance and this imbalance gives scant recognition of the fact that Gaelic Games are the best attended sporting events in the North of Ireland and also have now the greatest levels of participation by male and female participants.ldquoI do not wish this issue to become a political football whereby MLAs try to outscore each other on the back of an imbalance. I would prefer that this matter was championed by Ulster GAA and the GAA nationally to improve the coverage of our games. We need at the very least, parity in terms of live and deferred TV coverage by BBC in particular and a better recognition of our games by UTV.Mr McAteer also pulls no punches when he covers some of the more controversial moments of .ldquoThere were good things happened in Down GAA in , occasions when we hung out our brightest colours and showed how can deliver to the highest standard.ldquoThere were other occasions when mediocrity was the norm and we became very good at mediocracy and then there was the ugly when we showed the country our poor and unacceptable side.ldquoYes, for Down GAA it was a year of mixed feelings and mixed emotions, pride and shame shared equal space in  in the world of Down GAA.ldquoThe eyes of the country and indeedwe take social media into account, the eyes of the world were focused upon us when images from one of our fixtures went viral and everyone was shocked by what they saw. The images represented all that should not be about the GAA.ldquoPhysical violence has no place in our games or indeed at any level in our association. The fact that they might take place within the confines of GAA property is not excuse for acceptance of and turning a blind eye to such incidents.ldquoIf these incidents were happening on a public street after a Saturday night out they would be deemed to be assault and grievous bodily harm. They would lead to prosecutions and possible sentencing all of which can have a huge impact on the le of the victim and the transgressor. Someone will get badly hurt in some of these incidentsthey are to continue at our grounds.Mr McAteer adds: The one punch message has been part of a campaign by the GAA and the authorities in recent times and it is a very real message. Facts are that one punch could kill and that is in honesty something none of us would ever dare to dream of happening at a GAA game, but reality is that it could.

also be imposed on how long people can leave their vehicles in the Upper Square area in a bid to deter all-day parkers.While it is free to park in Castlewellan and there are currently no time

We must then mutually trade with each other in WTO terms. We already trade very extensively with other countries in this way. “Presently % of the UK’s exports go to the EU, and another % go to countries in the world that the EU has trade arrangements with. So % of our trade goes to either EU or EU-controlled trade arrangements. That leaves % which is traded on WTO terms around the world. “The UK’s biggest trading partner is the United States, and we don’t have a trade deal with them. We trade with them by and large on WTO terms. A hefty bit of our trade works in this way, so why not all of it  It can be done.”Mr Allister also warned that the backstop arrangement would be a stepping stone to a united Ireland and must be rejected to protect the Union.Storm warning: disruptions across NI this morningWEATHER WARNING: Rain and wind to batter NI with danger of flooding Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Further, he also dismissed claims by Remainers that a hard border on the island of Ireland would be the inevitable outcome of a no-deal Brexit, declaring that the idea of a backstop being a necessary part of any withdrawal agreement is “built on a hoax”.He added: “The only people with any legal obligation to institute a hard border is the EU. Under the EU treaties, it says the frontier state, in this case the Irish Republic, must provide and maintain the EU’s border.“ Leo Varadkar has said the Republic won’t be providing it, the EU and the UK have said they don’t require it, so the obvious question is who is going to implement it  “If the answer is no one, then why are we talking about the need for a backstop in the first place ”However, SDLP MLA Claire Hanna maintained that some kind of customs infrastructure along the Irish border would be requiredthe UK ended up trading with the EU under WTO terms. Without it, she claimed, the UK would be open to legal challenges from other nations.She told the News Letter: “If the UK were trading with the EU on WTO terms, as no deal advocates want but Brussels representatives have expressed serious concerns about, then keeping an open border would likely violate WTO’s non-discrimination principle.“This leaves the UK wide open to litigation from any other country who are subject to tarfs, and ultimately the EU will seek to take steps to protect the single market.”Responding to this claim, Mr Allister said: “The WTO is not an enforcement organisation in the sense that they go round looking to see who is infringing. They only act as a reactive body in that regard when someone has made a complaint.“So is Claire Hanna suggesting that the government of the Irish Republic would complain that the UK does not have adequate border checks  I don’t think so, so let’s be real here.”try catch  TrendingREVEALED: In pictures - every police station closed in Northern Ireland in last two decadesAll queers out daubed on N.I. flat front-doorWEATHER WARNING: Rain and wind to batter NI with danger of floodingEx-Isle of Man TT racer and TV presenter Guy Martin denies having fake Irish driving licenceTributes paid to tragic NI teacher who died in climbing accident          ..

next year.Union Theological College , a -year-old institution that is run by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, was one of four colleges that made up the Institute of Theology at Queen’s but has recently become the only college still offering undergraduate programmes.The move to halt new theology undergraduates at the college comes after a critical review.A spokesperson for UTC said the college “very much regrets and are disappointed by” the decision taken by Queen’s.“Along with other denominational theological colleges that have a relationship with a Russell Group University, Union has a long, positive and mutually beneficial relationship with Queen’s,” the spokesperson said. “The recommendations of this latest review in effect belittles the oversight of external examiners from prestigious UK universities and the effectiveness of the university’s own quality assurance processes. “By suggesting that students of theology at Queen’s have not been exposed to a breadth of theological perspective runs counter to, and contradicts, the reports of external examiners for theology at Queen’s over many years.”The spokesperson continued: “While obviously seeking to maintain our confessional commitment and Christian ethos, the college’s goal has never been to shirk the dficult and hard questions that relate to religious faith and belief. “Union Theological College trains some students for ministry in addition to the undergraduate theology degree offered to Queen’s students.Duchess of Abercorn, founder of Pushkin Trust, dies aged  Coremetrics  Coremetrics

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is now imposing severe and often highly questionable cuts in key quotas right at the point when an already challenging discard ban comes into full force.ldquoDespite the abundance of local fish stocks, Shetlandrsquos fishermen and fishing communities are to be punished by distant bureaucrats who are utterly obsessed with unworkable rules.ldquoThe Scottish fisheries minister and his team have been a strong voice for our industry throughout these talks, but the CFP ensures that the European Commission can mismanage fisheries at will and other countries can gang up to harvest more of the natural resources around our shores than we can.

It is now imposing severe and often highly questionable cuts in key quotas right at the point when an already challenging discard ban comes into full force.ldquoDespite the abundance of local fish stocks, Shetlandrsquos fishermen and fishing communities are to be punished by distant bureaucrats who are utterly obsessed with unworkable rules.ldquoThe Scottish fisheries minister and his team have been a strong voice for our industry throughout these talks, but the CFP ensures that the European Commission can mismanage fisheries at will and other countries can gang up to harvest more of the natural resources around our shores than we can.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
