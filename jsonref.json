A cockatoo was \u0027a clever flyer\u0027 but \u0027maybe too slow to avoid gull attacks.\u0027Two falcons died from illness another promising candidate lost feathers and trainers had to wait for it to molt and grow them back.The most promising flyer was the aforementioned raven, Do Da. In just three months, Do Da went from a successful 34-mile trip to six miles from shore to boat, and then four miles back to shore on the same day.       The CIA found that ravens were good for training and tried to use them in \u0027emplacement\u0027 missions, such as putting listening devices on windowsills, or for photo missions (file)         The CIA tried to use falcons, too. Unfortunately, two falcons died from illness and another lost feathers, leaving trainers having to wait for it to molt and grow them back (file)He was the most promising candidate for the Russia mission, the \u0027star of this project,\u0027 one scientist wrote, who figured out the right altitudes in the right winds, and acquired \u0027sufficient guile to outwit the native ravens and gulls,\u0027 which hid for attacks on him.But on a training mission he was attacked by \u0027the usual pair\u0027 of ravens - and was not seen again.The scientists were deeply dismayed. \u0027He had a large bag of tricks and was loved by all,\u0027 one wrote.The other major effort was with pigeons, used for over two millennia as messengers and to take photographs during World War I.The challenge was that pigeons work from home coops or roosts, places they are familiar with.The CIA needed them for missions in the Soviet Union, where they would fly between unfamiliar roosts and photo targets.The agency acquired hundreds of pigeons, testing them and cameras in areas around the United States to see if they could be trained on simulated paths.Soon the target became known: the shipyards in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) where the Soviets built nuclear submarines.After much training, the birds were brought to Washington for testing, and results were mixed.Some snapped perfect photos, but others flew out, with expensive cameras attached, and weren\u0027t seen again. One was attacked by a hawk, and came back three weeks later with no camera.The documents don\u0027t say if the Leningrad operation was attempted. But a 1978 review the CIA released made clear that there were too many questions about the birds\u0027 reliability."},{"url":null,"title":"Paul Nicholas 74 reveals turned chance invest Cats","story":"Share this article Every pound invested in the show generated a return of £56.57.

Esme was diagnosed with nephroblastoma, a type of kidney cancer after initially visiting a GP with constipation, in June 2019\u0027It was quite comforting after it was explained to me, if they\u0027re planning for her future it must mean there\u0027s a future to plan for, so maybe the cancer wasn\u0027t as scary as we expected.\u0027Whether she would have children in the future wasn\u0027t something that had ever even crossed my mind, but I\u0027m glad the doctors are looking out for her.\u0027Whilst waiting for her surgery there was no other children her age or younger in the clinic and we feel incredibly lucky that one day Esme has the chance to be a mum and we\u0027ll be grandparents.\u0027Esme is just two years old but she has undergone fertility treatment, it\u0027s mind blowing that her eggs will be usable when she\u0027s old enough to want her own children.\u0027It would be very difficult to know if she\u0027s one of the only girls to have this type of procedure, but I have never met any other family in the UK that has gone through the same thing as our beautiful Esme.\u0027\u0027She has a long road ahead of her, but we and her doctors are hopeful she will make a full recovery.\u0027The brave little girl underwent an operation to remove the tumour from her kidney two weeks ago - and surgeons also removed one of her ovaries at the same time.They discovered that the cancer has spread to her lung, but doctors have said as the cancer was caught early they are hopeful that a course of intensive chemotherapy should shrink the tumour.

His one-time ally is dismissed as ‘mendacious’ and ‘disloyal’ and a ‘foam-flecked Faragist’. As Mr Cameron himself once said in the Commons: ‘Calm down, dear!’It’s true that, in the case of Mr Gove, Mr Cameron grants he probably believed in the Leave cause he embraced. Mr Gove is nonetheless castigated for his disloyalty. But didn’t he owe a greater loyalty to his country than its leader?No one would complain if the former PM had tried to skewer former colleagues through sober and reasoned argument. It is the hyperbole and name-calling that is depressing. Of course, lies were told on the Leave side – as they were by Remainers. Mr Cameron rightly complains about the notorious slogan on the side of the Brexit bus suggesting that if we left the EU, a further £350million a week could be spent on the NHS. He doesn’t admit, though, that the probable weekly saving of £250 million is huge.       He critiques Gove and Johnson for their contact during the EU referendum and called Gove a \u0027foam-flecked Faragist\u0027       On the other hand, he shows – at any rate in the excerpts so far published – scant understanding of enormous public disquiet over unprecedentedly high levels of immigration during his time in office.All in all, this is not the measured and statesmanlike book of a man esteemed as a ‘class act’ while in power. Months brooding in that garden shed have warped his judgment.There could have been little objection if he had discharged this missile after the issue of Brexit was resolved and the nightmare of a Corbyn government averted. In that case, we would have merely marvelled that beneath Mr Cameron’s suave exterior beats an astonishingly tempestuous heart.Admirably, he initially agreed to postpone publication until after March 29 – when Britain was supposed to leave the EU – so as not to embarrass Theresa May. Presumably under pressure from tired-of-waiting publishers, he has now placed a bombshell under Mr Johnson. For there can be little doubt that his intemperate language about the leadership of the current administration will deepen old wounds in an already stricken Tory party, and worsen long-standing isions over Europe.          David Cameron was advised by George Osborne that Johnson and Gove were \u0027killing\u0027 his leadership and urged him to \u0027destroy their credibility\u0027And, at the same time, his assault on Mr Johnson, Mr Gove and others is bound to give comfort to extreme Remainers who are doing their damnedest to discredit the Prime Minister and the Government.During their party conferences, Lib Dem and Labour delegates will endlessly quote Mr Cameron’s highly negative judgment of Mr Johnson, and use it to weaken him and undermine his policies.So in reply to the question as to who will be most pleased by this book, my answer is: Those who wish the Tory party ill, and long to scupper Brexit.        "},{"url":null,"title":"Metal detectorist unearthed 2m haul Viking jewellery sued Church Scotland half","story":"Share this article However Mr McLennan, is now reported to have gone back on the agreement to share the proceeds with the church, prompting the threat of legal action.His friend and fellow metal detector enthusiast, the Rev David Bartholomew, who was with him when he made his discovery, said the euphoria when the first artefact was pulled from the ground had since turned to acrimony.The Castle Douglas minister said: \u0027Derek was my friend and it is sad that it has come to this.

said in public that he had \u0027an excellent professional and personal relationship\u0027 with Mr Cameron.  At the same summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted that Britain could not have got better terms when Mr Cameron tried to negotiate with Brussels. Mr Cameron had tied his referendum pledge to a plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain\u0027s membership of the EU. The UK was granted an exemption from the EU\u0027s founding goal of \u0027ever closer union\u0027 and there were small concessions on immigration.          David Cameron is accompanied by his wife Samantha as he waves goodbye to Downing Street in 2016 However, Brexiteers dismissed the renegotiation as a failure and Mr Cameron\u0027s gamble failed as Britons nonetheless voted to leave.  In his memoirs, Mr Cameron also says he \u0027felt no satisfaction\u0027 in being proved right when the pound crashed in the midst of the referendum result. Remainers had warned of an economic shock in the wake of a Brexit vote, but the Leave camp dismissed such warnings as fearmongering.   Mr Cameron announced his resignation just hours later.  Mr Juncker himself is due to leave office on November 1, the day after Britain\u0027s current Brexit date of October 31. Today he will meet Boris Johnson in Luxembourg as Mr Cameron\u0027s successor-but-one tries to secure a revised Brexit deal before the deadline. The European Commission president has repeatedly insisted that the deal negotiated with Theresa May will not be renegotiated. That deal was rejected three times by Parliament, forcing Mrs May out of office two months ago. Mr Juncker will be replaced by Ursula von der Leyen, a former German defence minister who scraped through by nine votes in her confirmation vote in July.    Boris Johnson questioned Michael Gove\u0027s mental health calling him \u0027a bit cracked\u0027 after being betrayed during 2016 Tory leadership race, David Cameron\u0027s memoirs reveal Boris Johnson questioned Michael Gove\u0027s mental health and suggested he was \u0027a bit cracked\u0027 after the Tory minister betrayed him during the 2016 Tory leadership race, the latest extracts of David Cameron\u0027s memoirs have revealed. Mr Gove famously sabotaged the first Johnson leadership bid in 2016 by launching his own rival campaign, forcing Mr Johnson to pull out. According to Mr Cameron, then-Chancellor George Osborne celebrated Mr Gove\u0027s betrayal, saying: \u0027We\u0027ve taken Boris out, now on to Port Stanley!,\u0027 a reference to the Falklands War. Mr Cameron also worked behind the scenes to help Theresa May win the contest to replace him, the extracts published by The Times reveal.   The former Prime Minister has already accused both Mr Johnson and Mr Gove of behaving \u0027appallingly\u0027 during the referendum campaign. Mr Cameron announced his resignation in June 2016 after captaining the losing side in the referendum, triggering the first Tory leadership contest for 11 years.  In the hours after the referendum result, Mr Cameron says he was \u0027on autopilot\u0027 as he called to congratulate Mr Gove who had been one of the ringleaders of the Vote Leave campaign.          Boris Johnson questioned Michael Gove\u0027s mental health and suggested he was \u0027a bit cracked\u0027 after the Tory minister turned on him during the 2016 Tory leadership race (they are pictured together that year), the latest extracts of David Cameron\u0027s memoirs have revealed He also apologised to world leaders including Barack Obama for his failed strategy to keep Britain in Europe.  Mr Johnson was initially seen as the front-runner to replace him but was forced to quit the race within days after Mr Gove\u0027s entry into the race.   Mr Gove, who had been helping Mr Johnson\u0027s campaign, dramatically quit his team and said the ex-London mayor could not \u0027provide the leadership\u0027 that was needed.   According to Mr Cameron, Mr Johnson wondered aloud whether former Education Secretary Mr Gove was \u0027a bit cracked\u0027.            David Cameron\u0027s autobiography will leave some of the Tory members aghastMr Cameron said he could not resist a cheeky dig at Mr Johnson in reply, saying: \u0027You should have stuck with me, mate.\u0027 The two Brexiteers are now back on the same side but the former PM\u0027s latest revelations will test how far they have patched up relations since 2016.As Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr Gove is now responsible for no-deal Brexit preparations in Mr Johnson\u0027s Government.  Mr Gove had previously said he was \u0027not equipped\u0027 to be Prime Minister, and Mr Cameron says he had taken those statements to be sincere.  Theresa May eventually won the race which ended without a full party vote after her last remaining rival, Andrea Leadsom, also pulled out.  Mrs Leadsom quit the race after a backlash over her comments in an interview about Mrs May not having children.  Mr Cameron said the comments were almost certainly not malicious but said the row persuaded Mrs Leadsom that she was not ready for the job.  But Mr Cameron himself also played a role in helping Mrs May win the contest, his memoirs reveal. Although he did not back any candidate officially, he \u0027secretly encouraged\u0027 his Tory colleague Gavin Williamson to help the May campaign in 2016. George Osborne, who was sacked as Chancellor by Mrs May and quit as an MP the following year, is said to have celebrated Mr Johnson\u0027s departure with a cryptic reference to the Falklands War. \u0027\u0027Now on to Port Stanley!\u0027 he said, meaning it was Michael\u0027s turn to fall next,\u0027 Mr Cameron recalls.  Mr Osborne had once been seen as a likely Tory leadership contender himself but he and Mr Cameron were both tarnished by the failed Remain campaign in 2016.  Boris Johnson also complained that \u0027people were looking at me as if I was a leper\u0027 after the referendum result which he helped to bring about. After declaring for Leave in February that year he became one of the most high-profile Brexit campaigners during the referendum campaign.  "},{"url":null,"title":"BBC overtake Netflix enter streaming market","story":"Share this article Despite commentators who have argued that BBC will only lose ground with younger people Lord

Whatever people might wish for is not on the table now.\u0027Because so many states balked at the settlement, it could complicate the bankruptcy process. The Sackler family members said they\u0027re still trying to get more states to sign on.\u0027We are hopeful that in time, those parties who are not yet supportive will ultimately shift their focus to the critical resources that the settlement provides to people and problems that need them,\u0027 they said.Key issues that could be decided include whether the suits against the Sacklers in state courts will be able to move ahead, and what will happen to the company itself. Under the tentative settlement deal, it would continue to operate, but with profits used to pay for the settlement. Another option could be for a judge to order it be sold.Court filings assert that members of the Sackler family were paid more than $4billion by Purdue from 2007 to 2018. Much of the family\u0027s fortune is believed to be held outside the US, which could complicate lawsuits against the family over opioids.A court filing by the New York Attorney General\u0027s office on Friday contended that Sackler family members used Swiss and other hidden accounts to transfer $1billion to themselves. The discovery of the transfers bolsters several states\u0027 claims that family members worked to shield its wealth because of the growing legal threats against them and Purdue.         Mortimer Sackler (center), his wife, Theresa (right), and daughter, Marissa (left), in 2003              Raymond Sackler\u0027s sons, Jonathan Sackler (left) and Richard Sackler (right)         Raymond Sackler is pictured here with his wife, Beverly Sackler. They are shown together shortly before Raymond\u0027s death in 2017              Protesters gathered in front of Purdue Pharma\u0027s Connecticut headquarter on September 12Among the transactions were millions of dollars shifted from a Purdue parent company to former board member Mortimer D.A. Sackler, prosecutors said in the papers.The discovery came as a result of subpoenas to 33 financial institutions and investment advisers.In one case, $64million was transferred in 2009 from a previously unknown trust called Purdue Pharma Trust MDAS, through a Swiss bank account, and then to Sackler, the filing said.Transfers to Sackler from another trust, called Heatheridge Trust Company Limited, were also routed through the same Swiss account, the filing said, while some transfers from a third trust, called Millborne Trust Company Limited, were routed through a different Swiss bank account.Prosecutors say Sackler also redirected substantial amounts to shell companies that own family homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons.New York, Massachusetts and others contend that the Sacklers drained more than $4billion from Purdue since 2007, moving much of it offshore to avoid future claims.New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement: \u0027While the Sacklers continue to lowball victims and skirt a responsible settlement, we refuse to allow the family to misuse the courts in an effort to shield their financial misconduct.\u0027Records from one financial institution alone have shown approximately $1 billion in wire transfers between the Sacklers, entities they control, and different financial institutions, including those that have funneled funds into Swiss bank accounts.\u0027The Sacklers have given money to cultural institutions around the world, including the Smithsonian Institution, New York City\u0027s Metropolitan Museum of Art and London\u0027s Tate Modern.The lawsuits assert that the company aggressively sold OxyContin as a drug with a low risk of addiction despite knowing that wasn\u0027t true.Since OxyContin, a time-released opioid, was introduced in 1996, addiction and overdoses have surged. In both 2017 and 2018, opioids were involved in more than 47,000 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In recent years, there have been more deaths involving illicit opioids, including heroin and fentanyl, than the prescription forms of the drugs. That change has happened as awareness of the dangers of prescription opioids has increased and prescribers have become more cautious.Purdue\u0027s drugs are just a slice of the opioids prescribed, but critics assign a lot of the blame to the company because it developed both the drug and an aggressive marketing strategy.According to a lawsuit filed by the Massachusetts attorney general, the company pushed big sales of OxyContin from the start. Doing so meant persuading doctors who had been reluctant to prescribe such strong painkillers that this one was safe.A court filing asserts that Richard Sackler, then a senior vice president in charge of sales at the company, told the sales force at a launch party for the drug: \u0027The launch of OxyContin Tablets will be followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition. The prescription blizzard will be so deep, dense, and white.\u0027Along with others in the industry, Purdue paid doctors who attested to the drug\u0027s safety and became a major funder of groups that advocated for pain patients and campaigned to have opioids prescribed.The Associated Press and the Center for Public Integrity found the industry and groups it funded were also politically active, spending more than $880 million nationally on lobbying and campaigns from 2006 through 2015. That spending helped the industry fight off restrictions on prescribing the powerful painkillers.All those issues are part of the lawsuits facing the drug industry now. The governments that are suing want reimbursement for costs associated with the opioid crisis and also funding for drug treatment and abuse-prevention programs.In court filings, Purdue has pointed out that its products were approved by federal regulators and prescribed by doctors.A federal judge overseeing close to 2,000 of the cases has been pushing the parties to reach a grand settlement that would make a difference in the opioid crisis. The judge, Cleveland-based Dan Polster, has scheduled a trial for the claims brought by Ohio\u0027s Cuyahoga and Summit Counties for October.One lawyer who is suing Purdue on behalf of clients including the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the state of Utah, which has signed on to the tentative settlement, said it\u0027s long been a consideration that Purdue could not afford to pay the massive amounts being sought in the lawsuits.\u0027I don\u0027t think there\u0027s enough money in that company to pay for the damages that are claimed,\u0027 said Jonathan Novak.That is one reason there are other defendants in most opioid lawsuits, he said, including members of the Sackler family and huge drug distribution companies such as McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health. State and local governments have also been battling over how any national settlements would be distributed.Organizations facing big lawsuits have a long history of bankruptcy claims.Dozens of asbestos companies have done so since the 1980s. Last year, USA Gymnastics filed for protection as it faced lawsuits over sexual abuse by team doctor Larry Nassar.Earlier this year, Pacific Gas \u0026amp Electric Corp. sought bankruptcy protection because it faces billions of dollars in potential damages from lawsuits over catastrophic wildfires in California.And in June, another company that makes opioids, Insys Therapeutics, filed for bankruptcy just days after reaching a $225million settlement with the federal government over a kickback scheme. Now, a bankruptcy judge will have to sort out how much of that will be paid.Vincent Buccola, a lawyer and professor of business ethics, said Purdue may be trying to avoid going to court in states that have been deeply harmed by the opioid epidemic.\u0027That\u0027s not the jury you want to face,\u0027 said Buccola, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. \u0027So you might try to stop that litigation from happening and consolidate it in front of bankruptcy judge who you hope will be more favorable.\u0027OxyContin Maker Purdue Pharma Files for Bankruptcy Protection - WSJ"},{"url":null,"title":"California woman swallowed engagement ring sketchy dream surgery","story":"Share this article The next morning, after realizing it wasn\u0027t a dream and was in fact reality, she feared telling her fiance who she had been dating for five-and-a-half years.Evans claimed her other half didn\u0027t believe her at first but then after they laughed for \u0027about an hour and a half,\u0027 they sought medical attention. At the hospital she says they struggled to explain the unusual incident because of how funny and unbelievable it was.Later a gastroenterologist advised it would be better to surgically remove the ring rather than wait \u0027to let nature take its course.\u0027\u0027At this point, I could definitely feel it in my guts, it  was starting to really hurt and make us nervous.\u0027I was really happy because I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d ever be able to look at it and appreciate it in the same way if I had to search  for it,\u0027 Evans told KGTV. It was only once she was forced to sign a medical release form to cover the hospital \u0027in case you die,\u0027 when reality sank in for Evans.\u0027I cried a lot because I would be SO MAD if I died.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15.

Now, 20 years later, comes It Gets Me Home, This Curving Track. The titles tell a tale: the one denoting urgency and obsession the other evoking a more contemplative mood, which is fitting for a book that ranges from the “unearthly sonic signatures” that bebop saxophonist Charlie Parker created in the 1940s to the “playfully dense personal mythology” that so defined Prince’s postmodern R\u0026ampB in the 1980s.The line “it gets me home, this curving track” is actually taken from a WH Auden poem, Walks, which, as Penman notes in his introduction, “is a lovely description of spinning vinyl, and also words that might have sprung from any number of unkempt and long-favoured songs”. Songs, in the traditional sense, have long fascinated Penman. He deconstructed them as a fleeting member of post-punk group Scritti Politti in the late 70s and came to revalue them in the following decade through his discovery of, and swooning admiration for, the torch song tradition.It was in the mid-1980s, when I started writing for the NME, that I first crossed paths with Penman. As I recall, he was in thrall to Tom Waits and seemed, from his dress sense (Waitsian) and drinking habits (Bukowskian), to be a man blissfully and wilfully out of time. Except that his writing style, to the dismay of many readers, was attuned to the contemporary frequency of continental lit theory – Barthes, Benjamin and Derrida the unlikely touchstones for his singular takes on the likes of Nic Roeg, Rickie Lee Jones, Paul Schrader and, less convincingly, it has to be said, Kid Creole and the Coconuts. It was stirring stuff, not least because it so ided opinion.Ultimately, its lasting import was of the viral variety, Penman’s unapologetically cerebral style influencing several key music writers who came after him, from Simon Reynolds to the late Mark Fisher, his prose seeming to cast as mesmeric a spell on his followers as the post-punk music that spawned it.As this book makes clear, though, Penman’s musical and sartorial roots were shaped by, of all things, mod. This took me by surprise when I first read his magisterial essay Even If You Have to Starve in the London Review of Books in 2013. (The LRB is where the nomadic Penman has belatedly found his true home, his wonderfully discursive style unconstrained by the tyranny of the word count.) Like the other pieces here, it is an extended book review as essay, Penman celebrating the European and American roots of mod while lamenting what it has since become – a very British kind of doggedly faithful, but essentially meaningless, pop-cultural nostalgia. He moves deftly between the personal and the sociohistorical, touching on leisure, class and the peculiar conjunction of conformity and narcissism that shaped the original mod aesthetic. “Early mods had a deserved rep for sartorial aloofness,” he writes, “which shaded into a kind of radiant anonymity.”There are arresting sentences such as this throughout the book. In his essay on Prince, Penman quips: “If too many soulful love songs, whatever their merits, are essentially Jack Vettriano, then 1980s Prince was Paul Klee.” Pithy, yes, but totally on the money. Prince’s purple reign – Dirty Mind (1980) to Lovesexy (1988) – so soundtracked Penman’s pop life at that time that he can retrospectively “plot all the high and low points of that shinydark hedonistic time using nothing but Prince songs”. His dissection of the singer’s genius and his strangeness is definitive, by turns celebratory, critical and starkly elegiac: “He died in the middle of the night, when names and colours matter least.”Penman’s take on James Brown similarly pulls together all the stark contradictions that defined a self-styled, larger-than-life persona and measures the stellar success against “the heavy, soul-consuming price” of a life lived in fame’s destabilising orbit. The human dilemmas of that devil’s contract are touched on, too, in Penman’s meditations on Frank Sinatra, a fearsomely controlling presence with a gift for expressing a solitude so essential as to be almost tragic, and Charlie Parker, whose hurtling life exceeded even the frantic pace of his most furious extemporisations. In many ways, Penman’s abiding subject is pop fame as a kind of inexorable American tragedy.For all that, it is his thoughts on two lesser-known, altogether more elusive, talents that I found most enthralling. The first is the late John Fahey, a blues obsessive and preternaturally gifted guitarist who transmuted the traditional into a new language, both eerily familiar and surprising. “Fahey merged the dark voodoo of the Delta blues with his own off-kilter sense of American self, nature and space,” writes Penman, nailing the musician’s otherness and his distinctive sensibility.Otherness of another kind informs the music of Donald Fagen, lead singer and co-songwriter of Steely Dan, whose irony-laced lyrics often evoke an older era when to be hip was not a stance but a kind of sacred calling. Not so any more. “Today, when we identify a hipster,” writes Penman, “it carries entirely different connotations from the word’s original, darkly lustrous charge. ‘Hipster’ is now a slight, because hipsters now are slight… Once, though, it truly mattered how hip you were… It was a dark and uncertain thing, an arduous rite of passage, almost a spiritual gamble.”It is the echoes of that spiritual gamble, and the wealth of secret knowledge attained in that arduous rite of passage, that resonate throughout It Gets Me Home, This Curving Track and make it such an essential read.This review is from the Observer• It Gets Me Home, This Curving Track by Ian Penman is published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (£12.99).

Its charming old town, array of Unesco World Heritage sites and sizeable port were always draws, but the new success of Game of Thrones, much of which was shot in the Croatian city, has made it a particularly popular stopoff point for cruise ships, whose passengers are told they can see the highlights in a single day.Minders accompany the passengers on to dry land, where they are typically bussed into the old town. Tours often start at the 16th-century Pile Gate, followed by a stroll along the Stradun to the city walls, entrance to which costs €30 (£27). Game of Thrones locations and Europe’s oldest pharmacy in a 14th-century Franciscan monastery are big pulls.There is increasingly troubling evidence, however, of the dramatic effect the guests are having, not least on the kind of city Dubrovnik will be. Where once there were bookshops, bakeries, butchers, hair salons and markets, tacky souvenir shops and stalls now cater to the tourists. The boats themselves also burn huge amounts of fossil fuel, creating water, air and noise pollution, and severely affect the marine ecosystem.A growing sense among city residents that tourism has become overtourism has caused the mayor to introduce tighter controls: during mornings just two ships can dock, with a third after midday. Next year a limit of 4,000 daily visitors will be allowed ashore, and in two years each will face a €2 tax.Another proposal is for ships – which tend to leave their motors running so that fridges, air conditioning and other technical functions continue to operate – to be forced to draw their energy supplies from the Croatian mainland instead. The mayor’s argument is that the city should at least benefit financially from the presence of the ships, though environmentalists note that the stipulation won’t stop the ships from running the motors or address the ecological damage. Nor is there any detail about how these measures will be applied, or how to ensure cruise ship operators abide by the rules.Meanwhile, in neighbouring Montenegro, another small city is facing a similar problem to Dubrovnik but is even more vulnerable. About two and a half hours along the coast, the tiny city of Kotor often has three huge ships docked in port, each staying for an average of 12 hours. The third most popular cruise ship destination in the Adriatic, Kotor expects a total of 500 cruise ships in 2019, bringing more than half a million people. “Compare this to 2003 when there were just 50 ships and 50,000 people,” says Vesna Mačič from Kotor’s institute of Marine Biology.Kotor is even more at risk than Dubrovnik because Montenegro is outside the EU, so EU laws don’t apply. The city has no recognised marine reserves, ships can use cheaper oil containing sulphur, and there are no restrictions on noise, which is known to damage organisms such as fish, dolphins and turtles.Kotor’s location – at the end of the Boka Kotorska bay, which is surrounded by large mountains – means gases emitted by cruise ships linger for longer, damaging local air quality. Fishermen and marine biologists also complain that the ships drag along the bottom of the bay, damaging the ecosystem, and that they discharge waste water, thus releasing foreign matter into the bay and further upsetting the natural balance. Flowering sea grass, clams and the rich seabed flora are said to have suffered as a result.“The biggest issue is due to the huge size of the cruisers, meaning only one can be directly attached to the port at one time, and the other two or three on any given day have to be anchored further away,” Mačič says.“This creates huge physical damage to organisms – sponges, coral, sea stars and others – inhabiting the muddy sea floor. On top of that you have the constant lifting and lowering of anchors and the movements of the ships, which affects light distribution and therefore the ability of plants to perform photosynthesis, endangering various types of algae and seaweed.” She wants to see cheap oil banned in line with EU legislation, the number of ships limited, buoys used instead of anchors, and tugboats turning the ships around.In a country where the average salary is around €453 a month, however, there is little appetite for any major restrictions on tourists, who spend an average of around €40 a day. In Kotor, at least, most locals are resigned to the idea that the cruise ships are unlikely to go away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ef4ce52826a8ea4719b576c2e64cb80159dfe04/299_0_5173_3105/master/5173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ef1e8669103ffce38b8c49a60e48e39","title":"council investment in shopping malls surges to 1bn","story":"One in five shopping centres bought since 2016 acquired by local authorities as towns hit by store closuresCouncils are set to spend £1bn on buying shopping malls as they try to redevelop town centres depressed by a wave of store closures.Local authorities have spent a record £775m buying shopping centres over the past three years, and are expected to outlay a further £230m next year according to research from shopping centre trade body Revo and property advisory firm Lambert Smith Hampton (LSH).Steve Norris, head of planning, development and regeneration at LSH, said investment had surged since 2016 and the current levels could be just the “tip of the iceberg”.“A lot of shopping centres are being bought for regeneration,” he said. “They might be failing assets in town centres where shop vacancies are high. Councils are going in to revitalise those sites, bringing in residential above or repurposing vacant units with something other than retail.”One in five shopping centres that have changed hands since 2016 have been acquired by local authorities that have ramped up investment as private sector spending has ed by £1.85bn.Financial investors have fled as more than 16 shops a day close their doors, squeezed out by the rise of online shopping and increased costs from business rates, wages and the fall in the value of the pound.But low-cost funding available from the public works loan board has allowed councils to bid higher sums for property and enjoy better returns on investment than private funds.There are concerns that councils are “dumb money” – paying over the odds for failing businesses. Shropshire council, for example, has been criticised for spending £51m on three shopping centres in Shrewsbury in 2018, all of which have since fallen in value.But cash-strapped councils are not only motivated by generating income to replace money cut by central government, they also gain benefit from supporting communities and attracting new businesses and residents by redeveloping moribund retail schemes.Shropshire council has argued, for example, that the short-term fall in value of its investment in the Darwin, Pride Hill and Riverside shopping centres is not a major concern. It gains annual income of £2.7m from the centres and is hoping to improve the attractiveness of the town by redeveloping at least one of the shopping centres with cinema screens, restaurants and a gym.Norris said council buyouts could be a “catalyst for change” but only where they were “underpinned by robust and fully costed business plans and investment strategies”.Successful schemes include Altrincham, where Trafford council invested in the town’s listed market hall, which was then revitalised as a fashionable dining space in partnership with a private investor, and Ashford, where the council has transformed the local Park Mall.Woking borough council has helped to revive its town centre by acquiring the tatty Wolsey Place in 2010 and integrating it more closely with another nearby shopping centre and the high street.Norris said redevelopment could take several years to complete and it was too early to judge the success of many schemes.“Only a few local authorities have actually stepped into the market. But a number I speak to are in the process of developing strategies and looking at purchasing assets now,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7ebcd6c6c1f40c29ee0b593b3d2c6ef7ffe652d/0_155_3921_2352/master/3921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ef6ca194c77ea9980e65a5f897e3905","title":"david cameron brexit","story":"But fixating on the decision to hold the referendum and his woeful politicking with the EU ignores the nitty-gritty of Cameron’s record, and thereby lets him off the hook. Brexit, after all, is symptomatic of things that run much deeper than our relationship with Europe. And on this score, Cameron and his former colleagues have huge questions to answer, if only someone would ask them. In the wake of the crash of 2007-08, they took control of a country that was already starting to show signs of fury, ision and seething resentment. Their biggest sin, it seems to me, was to encourage and accelerate those things, to the point that they were probably always going to explode in some awful drama of national self-harm.Senior politicians are usually strange creatures, with an amazing capacity for holding apparently contradictory impulses in the moment, Cameron probably believed that what he was fumbling towards was not just human and kind, but suited to a world in which people can self-organise as never before. But it was also clear that woven into all this stuff was a very familiar Tory antipathy towards what remained of the postwar settlement. In his interview with Cameron at about the same time, the Observer’s Andrew Rawnsley noted “his attachment to that Thatcherite phrase ‘rolling back the state’”.We all know what happened four years later. Mere days before the election of 2010, Cameron said that any Tory minister considering “frontline reductions” would be sent “straight back to their department to go away and think again”. He then commenced the decade of fiscal savagery that has left some of the most fundamental parts of the public realm hanging on for dear life: “an economic rescue job”, he now says, with his seemingly unshakable doublethink summed up in the claim that “the last thing I wanted to do was to make any cuts to anything”. The triteness is excruciating. Quite apart from the fate of adult social care, children’s centres and other vital services, Britain is now a country in which austerity is part of the everyday ambience, all shut-down pools and libraries, broken-down parks, and once-a-day buses. These things inflamed the sense of neglect that played a key role in the summer of 2016: credible academic research shows that pre-referendum support for Ukip correlated strongly with local austerity.There is a belief around at the moment, encouraged by many of the 21 Conservative MPs recently expelled from the party by Johnson, that it is only now that their party has become unprecedentedly nasty and irresponsible. But in 2013, I can clearly recall seeing huge hoardings at the Conservative conference in Manchester with such crude slogans as “Welfare capped”, “Immigration down”, and the dog-whistling formulation, “for hardworking people”. Cameron’s big speech reduced Labour’s time in power to “millions coming here from overseas while millions of British people were left on welfare”. He also assured his audience that “we must act on immigration directly … and we are. Capping immigration. Clamping down on the bogus colleges … If you are not entitled to our free National Health Service, you should pay for it. If you have no right to be here, you cannot rent a flat or a house … When you are a foreign prisoner fighting deportation, you should pay your own legal bills. If you appeal, you must do it from your own country, after you’ve been deported, not from here.”No one should now let him get away with styling himself as the failed pioneer of a softer, more sympathetic kind of politics. Whether or not he was privately uncomfortable with them, these words alone confirm not just that Cameron looked like an enthusiastic participant in the hostile environment doctrine that led to the Windrush scandal, but that Faragism had already infected the Tory soul.Two years later, having fused all this stuff with the crabby English nationalism awakened by all those warnings about Labour teaming up with the SNP, the Tories won an outright parliamentary majority, but that was only this agenda’s first victory. It doesn’t really matter that Cameron himself limply campaigned to stay in the EU and then shamefully departed the scene: if anyone agreed with the essential thrust of what he had been doing for the previous six years, how were they ever going to end up voting to remain?Politicians’ autobiographies are invariably tedious, truth-eluding things, often destined to be piled up in discount shops. Historians and political anoraks will take what they can from this latest example, but it will not shine much light on connections that are too often ignored. Brexit is partly the fault of irresponsible politicians who were not actually Brexiteers Johnson’s nasty opportunism is not that different from the approach taken by Cameron and George Osborne, two people whose role in Britain’s current disaster is still under-appreciated. Whatever alibis and excuses are given an airing this week, these things ought not to be forgotten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86db1fb383ef3502021cbd4bb982e4c212b55dd3/942_487_4568_2741/master/4568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5092a86eea9d9f436ebef396bc12cba8","title":"repeat after me vagina is not a dirty word","story":"Our collective reluctance to say ‘vagina’ shrouds women’s bodies – and their sexuality – in shameWhen Dr Jen Gunter, a US-based gynaecologist, and her publisher, Kensington Books, sought to promote her new book on Twitter, they ran into trouble. The problem was the title: The Vagina Bible. It appeared that “vagina” was red-flagged by Twitter Ads as “inappropriate language”.Gunter was understandably outraged: “When we’re not allowed to say a word the implication is it’s dirty or shameful. Not being able to buy an ad because of the word vagina for a book about vaginas is ridiculous.”A suitably vagina-laden outcry followed, and Twitter permitted the offending promoted tweets on its network. But if Twitter’s default position is to ban the word vagina on the grounds of vulgarity, what does that say about the way we think about women’s bodies?It’s time we all got comfortable with the term vagina – and while we’re at it, vulva, labia and clitoris. How are women supposed to talk about their health or sexuality if the anatomically correct words used to describe their body parts are taboo? While it might make sense to ask a beautician to vajazzle your vajayjay, cutesy euphemisms don’t cut it in the doctor’s surgery.“As a gynae doc I see so many adult women who refer to problems in their “down belowsminniefannyfoof” and then have to spend valuable consultation time trying to get them to specify which bit of their genitalia they are talking about,” observed one medic.Our unwillingness to correctly label female anatomy contributes to other problems, including a “pleasure gap” that sees men’s sexual needs prioritised over women’s. Sex is often seen as synonymous with male pleasure. Female pleasure, however, is usually overlooked, tossed into the too-hard basket.Dr Jessica Eaton, a UK-based psychologist who runs sex education training for teachers, recounts on Twitter how teachers admitted they were willing to say the word “penis” and talk about male masturbation, but none were comfortable talking about vaginas and female pleasure in the same way.The effect of this double standard is captured by Peggy Orenstein, who spent three years talking to young women about their experience of sex while researching her book Girls \u0026amp Sex. In a 2017 TED Talk, she talks about how many young women don’t feel entitled to enjoy sex. They expressed a sense of shame around their genitals, a problem that she says stems from a cultural reluctance to talk about women’s bodies. “There’s no better way to make something unspeakable than not to name it.”If we want to make female pleasure as important as male pleasure, we need to normalise conversations about sex – starting with the proper names for our sexual organs.It’s also essential for kids to know how to talk about their bodies. Sexual health educators argue that teaching children anatomically correct terms for their body parts – genitals included – helps reduce shame and gives them the language they need if they ever become the victim of abuse. Children are less likely to disclose inappropriate behaviour if they don’t have the vocabulary to describe it or believe that they will get in trouble for broaching a taboo topic.Now, many will note that the vagina refers specifically to the internal structure that connects the cervix to the external genitalia. In common parlance, however, vagina is shorthand for the whole kit and caboodle, which is fine with me.As Gunter argues in her book’s introduction, “language evolves and words take on new meaning”. She points out that just as the term “gut” originally referred to the lower intestinal tract but is now used to describe the entire digestive system as well as the liver and pancreas, “vagina” is typically understood to refer to the lower reproductive tracts.So, familiarise yourself with the correct terms for the human body’s reproductive bits and make sure your kids know the difference between the vulva and the vagina. After all, knowledge is power."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/162efa5c635c2c79399dbc09b890a371715c29a5/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e94826c4116c58dd6eb9408b97a1a54","title":"starting school traumatic parents","story":"My children’s school is good and safe, yet dropping them off has stirred an unsoothable panic I haven’t felt since they were babiesThere is so much to worry about, said Gertrude Stein, you might as well not worry about any of it. But then again she never dropped two children off at school for the first time. Mine started last week and while one was fine, the other stood in the doorway of her new classroom looking tiny and lost and very alarmed and did the thing that, in extremis, parents fear more than tears: no tears. Looking on from the corridor, I felt something lift up and leave my body like the spirits in Ghost.Controlling anxiety is the great labour of our age and one with no discernible end. I try to ide my fears into categories: those with controllable outcomes (there is a mouse in our skirting board), those with no solution but that I consider manageable (why do I persist in buying jeans that are too small when I know I’m too lazy to return them?), and those that form part of a great, amorphous cloud of dread that hovers just over the horizon (where will it end? Why do we live like this? If there is a God, why did He allow Instagram to happen?).When my children were babies, the existential terror of being responsible for other people was so vast the only way to control it was to attach it to real-world anxieties. It didn’t matter how fantastical I just needed a shape to hang on to. For a long time, every time I passed the waste-disposal chute in our hallway, I had to staunch a mental image of tripping, wrenching the door open and accidentally dropping one of my children down the 13-storey shaft to the cruncher below. It wasn’t great, but it was better than shapeless fear.That phase eventually wore off to be replaced with a worse one: the fear not of freak accident or ill-health but unhappiness. Were they unhappy? Why were they unhappy? Was it contextual or constitutional? Were signs of distress actually a good thing, given that the unhappiest people in the world are the ones who can’t show their unhappiness?Once my children learned to speak, it was curious to observe that their own anxieties trammelled along similar lines, the necessity of attaching a cause – any cause – to their fears. Over the past few months, I have talked them down about getting struck by lightning, getting killed in a flood, having a creature “come out of the wall” at them – and something I still can’t get a handle on about the Spice Girls not being real. “What if a bug crawls into my mouth?” asked my daughter the other day, and my answer – “It just wouldn’t, don’t worry about it” – was clearly inadequate because it keeps coming up.Meanwhile, with school, my own anxiety seems to have gone back to square one: amorphous dread. The place is good, and safe, and well organised. Apart from the agony of drop-off, my girls seem happy. But handing them over has thrown up the dust from those earliest days of unsoothable panic and here I am once again: wandering the aisles of the supermarket on a Tuesday morning, crushing an indent into the side of a pack of tofu sausages while shouting at myself in my head. Get a grip, woman!

These days, Kimmings is all about ‘self-care on steroids’“I don’t want people to faint, but if they do, they do.”The British theatremaker Bryony Kimmings is describing reactions to a moment in her new show, I’m a Phoenix, Bitch.Kimmings gained international renown on the festival circuit for 2015’s Fake It ’Til You Make It, a show made with her partner that showed the impacts of living with his clinical depression.She describes her staged works to date as “autobiographical experiment”. In 2010’s Sex Idiot, she told of retracing her sexual relationships to discover who had given her an STI. In 7 Day Drunk, she mapped the scientific impact of alcohol use on her creativity.I’m a Phoenix, Bitch – which premiered in the UK last year, and is now touring Australia – is “another bloody mental health show”, she says, and tells the raw story of the worst year of the writer-performer’s life.Despite the enormous success of Fake It ’Til You Make It, Kimmings and her partner both suffered breakdowns in its wake the birth of their son Frank brought unexpected complications.“I think everyone has postnatal depression, to be honest,” she tells me. “I don’t know a mother who hasn’t gone a bit loopy. Neither of us knew how to cope with me going insane.”And then it got worse. “My son got very ill. He got something called West syndrome. At four months old, he started having these seizures and began regressing to a newborn state.”As they began treating Frank for the infantile epileptic disorder, the relationship imploded. Kimmings and her partner were still touring. “We had to cancel the tour and the shit hit the fan,” she explains.Inspiration to make the new show came while she was still living through its subject matter. “I put on Twitter: our son is fucking ill, we’re bamboozled and we can’t tour, we’re not doing gigs,” says Kimmings, “And someone wrote, ‘At least it’ll be good for another show.’ I thought, ‘No way, this is too heartbreaking’ … but then I started to talk to all these women who’d had psychotic episodes after having children, and other women who were coping with the problems their children had.”The new show straddles stage genres. It’s high culture meets pop art meets group therapy meets Le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol – and on a much more spectacular scale than the low-budget fringe aesthetic that tends to be imposed on feminist work.Postnatal mental heath “isn’t the sexiest of topics”, Kimming admits, but she was emboldened viewing productions of Complicité theatre’s The Encounter and Robert Lepage’s 887. Both relate, with painful intensity, the personal stories of their creators. “I loved them both,” she says, but she realised this was “big-dick-swinging, auteur performance that you never see women do. I thought, ‘What the fuck?’ … I’ve never seen women in the UK stand on a stage that big with that much money thrown at it.”Inherently, I’m a Phoenix, Bitch, is Kimmings’ response to the gendered assumptions of the theatre. “Why in every fucking show does the woman die, or is raped, or survives because she’s rescued by some dude who slides in and sorts it all out?” she says. “Nora in a Doll’s House, Medea … I thought, ‘Fuck you, I’m going to do this show, because I went crazy and now I’m not crazy and I did it all my fucking self.’”The show may be about “how someone might drag themselves out of that kind of abyss”, but retelling her own story doesn’t neutralise its provocations. “I’ve had to work very hard with my therapist, my boyfriend and my crew to work it out … I did it for three weeks, I had this huge breakdown and was back on my meds.”In its next run, “positive affirmations and meditations” helped, but “opening the wound” meant she had to find ways of closing it. After an Edinburgh run, Kimmings was suffering “delusionary kleptoparapsychosis” and imagining spiders were infesting her house and her skin.It’s to head off the “spider feelings” that she now runs through self-care routines in the middle of the show. “The audience can’t tell,” she says – though with the viscerality Kimmings brings to her performances, they can sure tell if she doesn’t. “There’s a moment in the show where I lift quite heavy weights,” she says. “Twice in Edinburgh, people fainted at this point. I realised how deep I was in that grief.“So it’s self-care on steroids for this show. I’m still not there yet. I’m still getting the balance right.”• I’m a Phoenix, Bitch runs at Brisbane festival from 18 to 21 September at Queensland Performing Arts Centre’s Playhouse"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2cda87321a796e87ec9791242fb791bdb1a5161/0_76_4685_2810/master/4685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2156837810e0b547e59741eea778fe0f","title":"tibetan plateau glacier melt ipcc report third pole","story":"An IPCC report says two-thirds of glaciers on the largest ice sheet after the Arctic and Antarctic are set to disappear in 80 yearsMany moons ago in Tibet, the Second Buddha transformed a fierce nyen (a malevolent mountain demon) into a neri (the holiest protective warrior god) called Khawa Karpo, who took up residence in the sacred mountain bearing his name. Khawa Karpo is the tallest of the Meili mountain range, piercing the sky at 6,740 metres (22,112ft) above sea level. Local Tibetan communities believe that conquering Khawa Karpo is an act of sacrilege and would cause the deity to abandon his mountain home. Nevertheless, there have been several failed attempts by outsiders – the best known by an international team of 17, all of whom died in an avalanche during their ascent on 3 January 1991. After much local petitioning, in 2001 Beijing passed a law banning mountaineering there.However, Khawa Karpo continues to be affronted more insidiously. Over the past two decades, the Mingyong glacier at the foot of the mountain has dramatically receded. Villagers blame disrespectful human behaviour, including an inadequacy of prayer, greater material greed and an increase in pollution from tourism. People have started to avoid eating garlic and onions, burning meat, breaking vows or fighting for fear of unleashing the wrath of the deity. Mingyong is one of the world’s fastest shrinking glaciers, but locals cannot believe it will die because their own existence is intertwined with it. Yet its disappearance is almost inevitable.Whether we are Buddhists or not, our lives affect, and are affected by, these tropical glaciers that  eight countries. This frozen “water tower of Asia” is the source of 10 of the world’s largest rivers, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yellow, Mekong and Indus, whose flows support at least 1.6 billion people directly – in drinking water, agriculture, hydropower and livelihoods – and many more indirectly, in buying a T-shirt made from cotton grown in China, for example, or rice from India.Joseph Shea, a glaciologist at the University of Northern British Columbia, calls the loss “depressing and fear-inducing. It changes the nature of the mountains in a very visible and profound way.” Yet the fast-changing conditions at the third pole have not received the same attention as those at the north and south poles. The IPCC’s fourth assessment report in 2007 contained the erroneous prediction that all Himalayan glaciers would be gone by 2035. This statement turned out to have been based on anecdote rather than scientific evidence and, perhaps out of embarrassment, the third pole has been given less attention in subsequent IPCC reports.There is also a dearth of research compared to the other poles, and what hydrological data exists has been jealously guarded by the Indian government and other interested parties. The Tibetan plateau is a vast and impractical place for glaciologists to work in and confounding factors make measurements hard to obtain. Scientists are forbidden by locals, for instance, to step out on to the Mingyong glacier, meaning they have had to use repeat photography to measure the ice retreat.In the face of these problems, satellites have proved invaluable, allowing scientists to watch glacial shrinkage in real time. This summer, Columbia University researchers also used declassified spy-satellite images from the cold war to show that third pole ice loss has accelerated over this century and is now roughly double the melt rate of 1975 to 2000, when temperatures were on average 1C lower. Glaciers in the region are currently losing about half a vertical metre of ice per year because of anthropogenic global heating, the researchers concluded. Glacial melt here carries significant risk of death and injury – far more than in the sparsely populated Arctic and Antarctic – from glacial lake outbursts (when a lake forms and suddenly spills over its banks in a devastating flood) and landslides caused by destabilised rock. Whole villages have been washed away and these events are becoming increasingly regular, even if monitoring and rescue systems have improved. Satellite data shows that numbers and sizes of such risky lakes in the region are growing. Last October and November, on three separate occasions, debris blocked the flow of the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet, threatening India and Bangladesh downstream with flooding and causing thousands to be evacuated.There is another culprit besides our CO2 emissions in this warming story, and it’s all too evident on the dirty surface of the Mingyong glacier: black carbon, or soot. A 2013 study found that black carbon is responsible for 1.1 watts per square metre of the Earth’s surface of extra energy being stored in the atmosphere (CO2 is responsible for an estimated 1.56 watts per square metre). Black carbon has multiple climate effects, changing clouds and monsoon circulation as well as accelerating ice melt. Air pollution from the Indo-Gangetic Plains – one of the world’s most polluted regions – deposits this black dust on glaciers, darkening their surface and hastening melt. While soot landing on dark rock has little effect on its temperature, snow and glaciers are particularly vulnerable because they are so white and reflective. As glaciers melt, the surrounding rock crumbles in landslides, covering the ice with dark material that speeds melt in a runaway cycle. The Everest base camp, for instance, at 5,300 metres, is now rubble and debris as the Khumbu glacier has retreated to the icefall.The immense upland of the third pole is one of the most ecologically erse and vulnerable regions on Earth. People have only attempted to conquer these mountains in the last century, yet in that time humans have subdued the glaciers and changed the face of this wilderness with pollution and other activities. Researchers are now beginning to understand the scale of human effects on the region – some have experienced it directly: many of the 300 IPCC cryosphere report authors meeting in the Nepalese capital in July were forced to take shelter or ert to other airports because of a freak monsoon.But aAside from such inconveniences, what do these changes mean for the 240 million people living in the mountains? Well, in many areas, it has been welcomed. Warmer, more pleasant winters have made life easier. The higher temperatures have boosted agriculture – people can grow a greater variety of crops and benefit from more than one harvest per year, and that improves livelihoods. This may be responsible for the so-called Karakoram anomaly, in which a few glaciers in the Pakistani Karakoram range are advancing in opposition to the general trend. Climatologists believe that the sudden and massive growth of irrigated agriculture in the local area, coupled with unusual topographical features, has produced an increase in snowfall on the glaciers which currently more than compensates for their melting.Elsewhere, any increase in precipitation is not enough to counter the rate of ice melt and places that are wholly reliant on meltwater for irrigation are feeling the effects soonest. “Springs have dried drastically in the past 10 years without meltwater and because infrastructure has cut off discharge,” says Aditi Mukherji, one of the authors of the IPCC report.Known as high-altitude deserts, places such as Ladakh in north-eastern India and parts of Tibet have already lost many of their lower-altitude glaciers and with them their seasonal irrigation flows, which is affecting agriculture and electricity production from hydroelectric dams. In some places, communities are trying to geoengineer artificial glaciers that ert runoff from higher glaciers towards shaded, protected locations where it can freeze over winter to provide meltwater for irrigation in the spring.Towards the end of this century, pre-monsoon water-flow levels in all these rivers will drastically reduce without glacier buffers, affecting agricultural output as well as hydropower generation, and these stresses will be compounded by an increase in the number and severity of devastating flash floods. “The impact on local water resources will be huge, especially in the Indus Valley. We expect to see migration out of dry, high-altitude areas first but populations across the region will be affected,” says Shea, also an author on the ICIMOD report.As the third pole’s vast frozen reserves of fresh water make their way down to the oceans, they are contributing to sea-level rise that is already making life difficult in the heavily populated low-lying deltas and bays of Asia, from Bangladesh to Vietnam. What is more, they are releasing dangerous pollutants. Glaciers are time capsules, built snowflake by snowflake from the skies of the past and, as they melt, they deliver back into circulation the constituents of that archived air. Dangerous pesticides such as DDT (widely used for three decades before being banned in 1972) and perfluoroalkyl acids are now being washed downstream in meltwater and accumulating in sediments and in the food chain.Ultimately the future of this vast region, its people, ice sheets and arteries depends – just as Khawa Karpo’s devotees believe – on us: on reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. As Mukherji says, many of the glaciers that haven’t yet melted have effectively “disappeared because in the dense air pollution, you can no longer see them”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/499581299ebb37a43ec720c659470f7e66e37dbf/0_221_8123_4873/master/8123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dbc52fe9a2fd9605ad8675fe40b4b56","title":"windrush campaigners bring a political edge to fashion week","story":"Catwalk show and day of events in Brixton highlight positive impact of Windrush generationThe official London Fashion Week schedule had a fresh addition on Sunday night, as campaigners for and members of the Windrush generation modelled in a catwalk show.For the event, titled Next Generation Regeneration: Fashion and Revolution, they modelled plain black T-shirts emblazoned with the words ‘Compensation not Detention’ while one sang an acoustic version of Bob Marley’s Rastaman Chant. A second group was led by the rapper Drillminister, who also performed one of his tracks.The event, part of a day of Windrush-themed celebrations at Lambeth Town Hall in Brixton, was produced by model, designer and campaigner Eunice Olumide, who also created the collection on show.In doing so, her hope was to highlight the “huge and positive impact on society of the Windrush generation”, who were invited to the UK from the Caribbean to help rebuild the country after the second world war. Many were subsequently wrongly denied citizenship by the Home Office in 2018.“Fashion is a really good vehicle to discuss culture,” said Olumide, who was awarded an MBE in 2017 services to broadcasting, the arts, and charity. “It’s very visual and it’s something that’s been very well archived. There is something fascinating about the way the culture of the Windrush generation affected the UK so significantly in terms of dress and style and fashion, as well as music. They influenced ska, punk, and other subgroups and cultures coming out of that period.”Ahead of the show itself, attendees were invited to listen to free fashion and sustainability presentations, music performances and panel discussions with comedian Nish Kumar, as well as singer Jamelia, who later attended the fashion show.More than half of the passengers on the Empire Windrush had left homes in Jamaica.\u0026nbspAccording to the official passenger list – held by the National Archives – 541 people gave their last country of residence as Jamaica, out of a total 1,027 onboard.\u0026nbspBermuda was the last country of residence of 139 passengers, while Trinidad was listed for 74 people. Sixty-six passengers came from Mexico, but their nationality was recorded as Polish.\u0026nbspFifteen people came from other parts of the UK: 10 from Scotland, four from Wales and one from Northern Ireland.\u0026nbspAmong the passengers were small numbers from countries as far apart as Burma (five people), New Zealand (two), Norway (one) and Uganda (one). A couple of stowaways were also mentioned on the passenger list: a 39-year-old dressmaker from Jamaica and a 30-year-old from Trinidad.“The Asian community is not immune to the racism of this government,” said Kumar. “The fight of the Windrush generation is the fight of everyone from an immigrant background.”An earlier fashion presentation by Harris Elliott paid reference to the Windrush period, and was followed by a sustainability presentation by fashion designer Nkwo, whose work is made from recycled denim. The day’s keynote speech was delivered by human rights activist Sir Geoff Palmer.Following the show, Lambeth councillor Sonia Winifred spoke of how the Windrush generation had contributed to the UK’s sense of style.“We know that the Windrush generation looked fantastic,” she said. “The men were immaculate, the women just sensational.”Started in the 1980s, London Fashion Week is organised by the British Fashion Council. It takes place four times a year, in February and September for womenswear and January and June for menswear. February showcases autumn and winter looks, while September’s focus is on the following spring and summer seasonsAround 14,000 people attend each year, including press and buyers, and the designers exhibiting include major heritage brands as well as emerging talent.After the main event has ended, the 4-day London Fashion Week Festival takes place. This allows consumers and shoppers a chance to experience the shows and view collections.While located some miles from the other London fashion week shows’ central London locations, the Next Generation Regeneration: Fashion and Revolution show’s venue was significant, with Lambeth described as “the heart of the Windrush community”. There is also currently a petition to erect a memorial in Brixton’s Windrush Square, opposite the town hall, rather than the government proposed location of Waterloo station.“The fashion industry has long been linked to revolution, anarchy and significant change within culture and society,” said Olumide. “It is an area where marginalised groups have often been able to bring recognition to various serious social, economic and environmental issues within everyday life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/373f35f0c7ae9df818e87d907111fc363431ca60/0_290_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e94c9235751672dd7e3076fffeccae7","title":"j lo for the win taking an early look at oscars 2020 frontrunners","story":"The major fall festivals are now over, giving us a clearer idea of which stars might find themselves prepping an acceptance speech for FebruaryAfter what’s been a mostly God-awful year at the movies, the fall festival season has felt more necessary than ever, a warm hug after eight months of being repeatedly slapped in the face.Shot-in-the-dark speculation over next year’s awards race has been replaced with far more informed predictions, a guessing game still, but one that’s already easier to play. By this time last year, we’d already seen six of the eight best picture nominees and so with Venice, Telluride and Toronto out of the way once again, we can sift through the hits and misses to figure out what films and performances will have enough power to motor their way through to February.Let’s start with Venice, a festival that’s become a reliable launching pad for the surer bets – in previous years Birdman, Gravity, The Shape of Water, Roma and La La Land all debuted – although this year’s crop offered up a more mixed bag than usual. The biggest story came from an unlikely place: a DC movie from The Hangover director Todd Phillips. Grimy origins tale Joker would have arrived with a question mark no matter where it landed but playing in competition at arguably the most prestigious film festival in the world, it was an even wilder curio, the highest profile slot a comic book movie has ever snagged. Reviews were mostly rapturous, especially for star Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, and it went on to win the festival’s biggest prize, the Golden Lion, one of only six American films to do so in the last 30 years. It continued to impress in Toronto although some pushback began and negative reviews started to flood in, criticising its superficial emptiness and potentially worrying effect on what’s set to be a massive audience. At this stage, I’d bet heavily on a nomination and even a win for Phoenix but the film might struggle to sustain itself with voters who might be repelled by its subject matter and (*whispers*) one-note vacuity.There were also polite reviews for James Gray’s long-gestating space epic Ad Astra and Steven Soderbergh’s financial satire The Laundromat but both were commonly seen as awards race non-starters while the less said about Kristin Stewart’s muddled Seberg, the better.Away to the mountains soon after for Telluride, a more boutiquey festival that over a long weekend tends to premiere a more starry, and more mainstream, bunch of contenders – previous festivals have welcomed Wild, The Imitation Game, Moonlight, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, 12 Years a Slave and Ladybird.This year, one of the safest conclusions is that Renee Zellweger will be making a flashy awards season comeback with her role as Judy Garland in Judy. The film received mixed notices, with many critiquing its by-the-numbers storytelling, but almost everyone was in agreement over Zellweger’s effective performance and the Academy loves an off-screen narrative, the former winner returning to the fold after years in the wilderness. There was another safe bet in the shape of Ford v Ferrari, starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, which seems to be taking the slot of this year’s boringly solid “I guess so” contender, the kind of film no one really gets excited about but no one truly hates. The audience at the Toronto premiere responded with a great deal of enthusiasm, more so than some of the later reviews. Acting recognition depends on how Fox decides to campaign the two leads, one of whom will likely to be demoted to supporting, but you can expect it to take the eighth best picture slot before promptly being forgotten about by March.Critics admired the effects in sturdy Felicity JonesEddie Redmayne ballooning adventure The Aeronauts, while recognising its cliches, suggesting its awards chances might be slim while most found Edward Norton’s labour of lovevanity project Motherless Brooklyn to be a misfire. There was early buzz and early enthusiasm for Krisha director Trey Edward Shults’ bold and stylistic A24 drama Waves, with some comparing it to Moonlight, but by the time it showed at Toronto, reviews started to sour. It could still be an Independent Spirit Awards contender but anything bigger is unlikely. Most seemed to like The Two Popes, a film that also went on to be a big hit with audiences in Toronto, and Netflix’s papal drama, starring leadsupporting actor contenders Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins, could be a reliable awards mainstay this season while finally, Adam Sandler could see himself in the running for a best actor trophy for his barnstorming turn in the Safdie brothers’ exhausting drama Uncut Gems, but the film’s abrasiveness could turn some voters off.Just a week later and all eyes were focused on Toronto, a festival that boasts the most stars if not the most slam-dunks in terms of awards season – previous premieres include If Beale Street Could Talk, Still Alice, I, Tonya, Lion and The Martian. Last year saw Green Book start its shock crawl to winning best picture, giving the festival a much-needed bump, and this year saw a few similarly effective crowd-pleasers spark awards talk. The surprise name on everybody’s lips during the week was Jennifer Lopez, whose performance as a stripper stealing from her clientele in the raucously entertaining fact-based drama Hustlers was praised by almost every critic. It’s a sensational turn in a film that was also largely praised and had many, including myself, predicting a best supporting actress nomination. The Academy already loves her (she’s one of their most used picks to announce an award) and the film is shaping up to be one of the fall’s biggest sleeper hits, everything aligning for a dream campaign.Another sure bet from Toronto came from two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks and his deep-rooted transformation as much-loved kids TV star Mister Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. Avoiding the structure of a traditional biopic, the pic instead positions Rogers as a kindly figure in the life of a journalist interviewing him meaning that Hanks will likely be running as supporting actor which would, astonishingly, be his first nomination in 19 years as he was snubbed for Captain Phillips, Bridge of Spies and The Post. Expect the film to also get best picture recognition with screenings accompanied by pretty much non-stop sniffles. There was a similarly emotive reaction to fact-based legal drama Just Mercy which starred Michael B Jordan as lawyer Bryan Stevenson. The film was seen as boringly made by some but almost all appreciated its powerful narrative and while Jordan’s role might be a bit too muted for Academy attention, it’s likely that Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, playing a falsely imprisoned inmate, will grab a best supporting actor nomination. The film itself is also the kind of solid, tear-jerking, crowd-pleaser that could see it genuinely affecting voters, this year’s Green Book if you will, just without the whitewashing.One of the festival’s most enthusiastically received films was Rian Johnson’s devilishly entertaining whodunnit Knives Out, a star-studded Agatha Christie homage that had the most ebullient audience reaction I’ve seen for months. It’s probably not an awards contender although if voters react as well as Toronto critics did, then a screenplay nomination could happen. Another audience favourite was Takia Waititi’s second world war comedy Jojo Rabbit, which sees him playing Hitler as cast as a buffoonish imaginary friend. Critical response was mixed but its simple, twee storytelling could work with the Academy who might respond to Scarlett Johansson’s charming supporting performance. The film also received a major boost yesterday winning the festival’s people’s choice award, seen as a predictor of Oscar success. Voters might also warm to Eddie Murphy’s turn in biopic Dolemite is My Name and especially to his redemptive arc off-screen which could secure him a best actor nomination.Elsewhere the festival saw a lot of half-misses. Impassioned but formulaic Harriet Tubman biopic Harriet received muddled praise for star Cynthia Erivo but not the film itself, Noah Hawley’s wild astronaut drama Lucy in the Sky was seen as a stylish ersion but we won’t see Natalie Portman returning to the best actress category after some scornful reactions while the much-anticipated adaptation of The Goldfinch crash-landed with some of the festival’s harshest reviews.Both Telluride and Toronto also provided a major boost to Cannes favourite Parasite, Bong Joon-Ho’s savage satire that many claim could be South Korea’s first ever best foreign language film nominee and even find its way into the best picture race. Cannes also saw Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time in Hollywood launch its steady journey to the Oscars with the film likely to pick up a number of major nominations, maybe including a supporting actor win for Brad Pitt, while Pedro Almodóvar’s autobiographical drama Pain and Glory might push Antonio Banderas into the lead acting race. Sundance also saw deserved buzz for Grand Jury prize winner Clemency and star Alfre Woodard although it might be too small to register for voters while Awkwafina’s charming performance in The Farewell will be a critics circle favourite and possibly, with a strong campaign, creep into bigger awards consideration. Annette Bening’s non-gimmicky turn as Dianne Feinstein in The Report could also slide into the best supporting actress category although the film could be too dense and talky for some.The year is far from over though and there are a number of big bets we’ve yet to see. One of the biggest is unveiled in less than two weeks, Martin Scorsese’s Netflix saga The Irishman starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. It premieres at the New York film festival before a limited release pre-empts its streaming bow. There’s also plenty of buzz around Jay Roach’s Roger Ailes drama Bombshell which focuses on the women who brought him down. While the recent trailer seemed to suggest that Margot Robbie would be the lead, it’s reportedly Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly who dominates the film and could see her back in the running for the first time since 2005’s North Country. The star-packed cast also includes Nicole Kidman, John Lithgow, Kate McKinnon, Allison Janney, Malcolm McDowell and Rob Delaney making it a strong contender for best ensemble cast at next year’s SAG awards.Sam Mendes is also returning with his first non-007 film since 2009’s Away We Go and his first world war drama 1917 could be his Dunkirk with an ensemble of younger British actors as well as supporting turns for Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch. This year’s AFI festival will open with Bonnie and Clyde-esque drama Queen \u0026amp Slim starring Oscar nominee Daniel Kaluuya and the trailer suggests at the very least some stunning visuals thanks to acclaimed music video director Melina Matsoukas. And finally, with a prime Christmas Day release, expect awards aplenty for Greta Gerwig’s Little Women adaptation with a cast that includes Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Laura Dern, Timothee Chalamet and Florence Pugh, who rumours suggest could be the film’s ace.Quentin Tarantino – best director, Once Upon a Time in HollywoodTom Hanks – best supporting actor, A Beautiful Day in the NeighborhoodBrad Pitt – best supporting actor, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/888933f2d3b1bee76f1492f9e5e787e502953b4c/0_116_5616_3372/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19498b68ea0891248f50fb37f5f10507","title":"zhang yimou shadow house of flying daggers red sorghum","story":"As the Chinese auteur’s new blockbuster goes online, it’s time to catch up on his greatest hits…It was buried so inconspicuously in the list of forthcoming home entertainment releases, with a pretty inconspicuous title to boot, that I nearly overlooked it. But there it is: after nearly a year of eager anticipation from arthouse auteurists and wuxia genre geeks alike, Zhang Yimou’s Shadow (Universal, 15) is skipping UK cinemas and heading straight into your living rooms from Monday.Notable films going directly to small-screen platforms is a preoccupation of this column, though they’re often small-scale indies that don’t suffer too much from the downsizing. (The breath-on-your-neck intimacy of last week’s featured film Her Smell, for example, plays well in private.) Shadow is different: an out-and-out Chinese blockbuster, it’s a panoramic period spectacle crying out for the sound and fury of a cinema. Fifteen years ago, Zhang’s period martial arts dazzler House of Flying Daggers made nearly £6m in British cinemas the idea of a similar project from the director being demoted in this fashion would have been unthinkable.Times and tastes change, I suppose Zhang’s reputation, meanwhile, has been dented by such recent crossover clangers as the culturally dubious Matt Damon adventure The Great Wall. But Shadow is a reassuring return to form for the 69-year-old veteran, as well as an entirely sumptuous experience on its own terms: just about every frame invites a separate gasp. An old-school action fantasy rooted in Chinese legend from the Three Kingdoms era (AD220-280), the kings-and-soldiers-and-subterfuge saga is tangled and absorbing, and also somewhat beside the point.For visually, Shadow is a kind of ravishing anomaly: a full-colour epic that has nonetheless been designed and styled entirely with a monochrome palette, working in more literal shades of grey than you ever thought possible, as if every set has somehow intricately been painted in ink and wash. It’s as purely beautiful as anything Zhang has made, and you’ve never seen exactly the like: it’ll hold up on your television, certainly, though you may wish for what could have been.Woman at War (Picturehouse, 12)A surprise crowdpleaser in cinemas, this Icelandic gem doesn’t go for easy sentiment: its darkly comic story of an environmental activist reconciling her mission with her dreams of motherhood is nuanced, complex feminist cinema.John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum(Lionsgate, 15)Nothing nuanced about the latest instalment of Keanu Reeves’s puppy-loving assassin franchise, but it still does this kind of action at another, fluorescently kinetic level: even the blood glitters.We the Animals (Eureka, 15)This story of three brothers growing up under different parental influences in upstate New York isn’t wildly new in the genre, but there’s a compelling, bruised conviction to its storytelling.Apocalypse Now: Final Cut (Studiocanal, 18)Final Cut? Is FFC serious? If not more essential than 2001’s Redux, the film remains magnificent in any form, and this box set includes three cuts — Theatrical, Redux, Final — for good measure.

The change starts late on a summer’s evening, when you first notice the soft, familiar scent of distant woodsmoke in the sudden chill of the air. Then, a day or two later, a damp, mushroomy mist hovers over the gardens and parks. Later, you notice the leaves have turned silently from yellow ochre to the walnut hue of tobacco. Autumn is here once again. You may sigh, rejoice or open a bottle. For many, this is the end of their year. For me, this is when it starts, when warmth and bonhomie come to the fore. With the change of weather, supper takes on a more significant role. What I crave now is food that is both cosseting and warming, substantial and deeply satisfying. Food that nourishes but also sets me up for going back out in the cold and wet. And yet, I still find my diet is heavily plant-based with less emphasis on meat. It is simply the way it has progressed over the years and shows little sign of abating.At the start of the longest half of the year, our appetite is pricked by the sudden drop in temperature, and as evenings get longer, we have the opportunity to spend a little more time in the kitchen. To mash beans into buttery clouds. Simmer vegetable stews to serve with bowls of couscous. To bring dishes of sweet potato to melting tenderness in spiced cream. And, of course, the pasta jar comes out again.My cold weather eating is more substantial than the food I eat for the rest of the year. Dinner becomes about one main dish rather than several lighter ones, and the focus shifts towards keeping warm. On returning home I will now happily spend an hour cooking. Maybe a little longer. The oven gets more use at this time of year, the grill and griddle probably less. More food will come to the table in deep casseroles and pie dishes. The temperature of the plates and bowls will change. We want to hold things that warm our hands, a sign of the happiness to come.There will be carbs. They protect and energise us. They bring balm to our jagged nerves. (Winter is nature’s way of making us eat carbohydrates.) Crusts – of pastry, breadcrumbs and crumble – add substance potatoes fill and satisfy and there is once again a huge sourdough loaf on the table. Rice and noodles are no longer a side dish, and now become the heart and soul of dinner.And, of course, there must be pudding. An early autumn crumble of damsons and almonds. Chocolate puddings (you really must make the ones with dulce de leche). Ginger cake with a cardamom cream and a custard pudding set with cake and apples. There will be nut-encrusted shortbreads with blood orange and baked apples with crisp crumbs and cranberries.I probably eat more puddings during the cold months, but mainly at the weekend. The main course recipes are predominantly for two the puddings though, are all for four or more. The recipes are made for sharing with friends and family. That said, most of them are rather fine eaten the following day. Especially those little chocolate puddings.Bright flavours for a cold day.For the dressingblood-orange juice 2 tbspsherry vinegar 2 tbspSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Place a large piece of tin foil in a roasting tin. Wash and trim the beetroot, taking care not to break their skins, and place them in the foil. Add the olive oil, two tablespoons of water and a grinding of salt and pepper, then scrunch the edges of the foil together to seal. Bake the beetroots for 45 minutes to an hour till tender to the point of a knife, then remove and set aside.Slice the radishes in half and put them in a mixing bowl. Slice the peel from the orange flesh, taking care to keep any escaping juice, remove the segments from the membranes, then add the segments to the radishes. Peel the beetroot and cut each one in half, then into quarters, and add them to the mixing bowl.Wash and trim the watercress. (I like to dunk it in a bowl of iced water for 20 minutes to crisp it up.) Put the mint and parsley leaves in with the orange and beetroot together with the trimmed watercress and the pumpkin seeds.Make the dressing: put the blood-orange juice in a small bowl, add the sherry vinegar, season with salt and pepper then pour over the salad and toss gently.The reassurance of pasta. The soothing notes of cheese and cauliflower.Put a deep pan of water on to boil and salt it generously. Finely grate the parmesan. Cut the cauliflower florets from the main stalk.Warm the butter and oil together in a shallow pan, then fry the cauliflower florets for five minutes or so until lightly crisp and golden. Put the orecchiette into the boiling water and cook for about nine minutes or until tender.Pour the cream into the cauliflower, add the grated parmesan and lower the heat. Drain the pasta and add it to the cauliflower and cream. Season with black pepper. Chop the dill fronds, stir into the pasta and serve.• Broccoli, brussels tops, brussels sprouts and kale are all perfectly acceptable in place of the cauliflower. The pasta is interchangeable too, but it’s worth choosing one that will hold a little puddle of sauce, such as casarecce, anelli, cavatelli or ditalini. I suggest you avoid the larger varieties of penne, which is rather like eating pieces of rubber tubing.Hot stock, green peas and the allure of dumplings.Bring a deep pan of water to the boil and salt it generously. Add the gnocchi and let them cook for three or four minutes, until they come to the surface, or follow the instructions on the packet. Bring the stock to the boil and add the peas.Remove the gnocchi with a draining spoon and ide between two bowls. Ladle over the stock and peas, then separate the eggs and lower a yolk into each bowl. Sprinkle two tablespoons of grated parmesan over each serving. Stir the yolk into the stock and peas as you eat, making an impromptu sauce.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Place the potatoes flat on a chopping board, then slice them at ½cm intervals, cutting almost through to the wood. It becomes immediately obvious why they are sometimes called toast-rack potatoes.Place the potatoes in a roasting tin, trickle with some of the olive oil and roast for about 45 minutes till crisp and golden. Meanwhile, put the tomatoes and unpeeled garlic cloves in a small roasting tin with the remaining olive oil, grind over a little salt and black pepper, then place in the oven. Roast the tomatoes for about 35 to 40 minutes, until they are soft and lightly browned.Remove the tomatoes and garlic from the oven. Pop the garlic from its skin and add the flesh to the tomatoes. Crush the tomatoes and garlic with a fork, stirring in the fresh horseradish as you go. When the potatoes are crisp and golden, remove them from the oven and serve with spoonfuls of the crushed tomato.• Some people find it easier to “hasselback” the potatoes by placing each one in the hollow of a wooden spoon and slicing downwards, thus avoiding cutting through to the chopping board. It’s a good trick.A soup to soothe the soul.Serves 4celeriac 1kgvegetable stock 400mlmilk 600mlchives 25golive oil 125mlhorseradish root 15g, grated pumpernickel or other rye bread 100gPeel and roughly chop the celeriac, then place in a deep pan with the stock and milk and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.While the soup is simmering, chop the chives and put them in a blender with the olive oil. Blitz to a bright green dressing.Puree the celeriac mixture, in two or three batches, using a blender. If you have a stick blender, process it directly in the pan. Stir the horseradish into the soup and check the seasoning. Crumble the pumpernickel and toast briefly in a dry, shallow pan till lightly crisp.Ladle the soup into bowls, pour in the chive oil and scatter over the pumpernickel.• Celeriac is one of the more unsung vegetables, but has plenty going for it. I like it shredded and stirred into a mustardy mayonnaise, but also coarsely grated and fried in olive oil and butter until golden and sizzling and served with a spritz of lemon.The smoky flavours of mushrooms and greens.Serves 2dried mushrooms 25ggreens, such as cavolo nero 200gpecorino 200gfregola 200gbutter 25gBring 1 litre of water to the boil, add the dried mushrooms, remove from the heat and cover with a lid. Set aside for 15 minutes to infuse.Wash and finely shred the cavolo nero. Finely grate the pecorino. Bring the mushroom stock back to the boil, add the fregola and cook for 12 to 15 minutes until tender but not soft. The pasta should still have a slight chewy quality. Drain the fregola and mushrooms.Melt the butter in a frying pan and add the shredded greens, frying them for a minute or two till they start to brighten and wilt. Fold in the drained pasta and mushrooms, then the grated pecorino. Pile into shallow dishes.• Fregola is easy to find in Italian food stores. I like to look out for the Sardinian toasted variety, which has a pleasing nutty flavour.• In place of cavolo nero, you could use crinkly-leaved savoy cabbage or young kale.• The quantity of pecorino sounds alarming, but it is there to bring the whole dish together and offer a luxurious contrast to the otherwise humble ingredients.The humble sweetness of baked rice. The syrupy luxury of fig jam.Set the oven at 140Cgas mark 1.Crack the green cardamoms, extract the tiny brown-black seeds, then crush them to a powder. A pestle and mortar will work if you don’t have a spice mill. Pour the milk into a saucepan. Add the ground cardamom seeds, bay leaves, vanilla pod and butter, and bring to the boil.Put the pudding rice and caster sugar in a baking dish, then, as soon as the milk boils (watch carefully), pour the hot milk over the rice and stir till the sugar has dissolved.Slide the dish into the preheated oven and bake for two hours until the rice is soft and creamy and the skin is pale gold. Serve with spoonfuls of soft fig jam.• If fig jam proves tricky to track down, slice six small fresh figs in half and put them in a saucepan with four tablespoons each of granulated or caster sugar and water. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer till the sugar and water have turned to a syrup and the figs are soft and on the point of collapse.Serves 2dark chocolate 100gdulce de leche 2 tbspeggs 2caster sugar 100gcantucci to serveSet the oven at 160Cgas mark 3. Break the chocolate into small pieces and leave to melt, without stirring, in a heatproof bowl suspended over a pan of simmering water. As the chocolate melts, gently stir in the dulce de leche and turn off the heat.Break the eggs into a large bowl, add the sugar and beat until thick and fluffy. A food mixer with a whisk attachment will give the best results. Stir the chocolate and dulce de leche into the mixture. You need only two three or three stirs to incorporate it. Any more and you might over-mix it.Transfer to two ramekins, using a rubber spatula. Put the ramekins into a roasting tin or baking dish. Pour enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins, then bake for 20 minutes until the surface is lightly crisp and the inside thick and creamy. Serve with a teaspoon and, if you wish, cantucci biscuits.• A soft crust appears on these puddings as you bake them, while the inside stays rich and fondant-like. It will stay like that for an hour or two, should you wish to make them a little ahead of time.• Heatproof china ramekins are ideal for these, but you can bake them in ovenproof cups too, or even metal thali dishes.• I have baked these chocolate puddings and eaten them the following day, when they are like thick, fudgy chocolate mousses.Greenfeast: Autumn, Winter by Nigel Slater (Fourth Estate, £22).

By some accounts, Norwich’s entire squad cost less than a single City substitute, but yet – after the 3-2 reverse – it was the visitors who were felt to have a glaring absence in their team.The name being uttered with a sigh was that of Aymeric Laporte. The “most solid and incredible defender that we had in the previous season”, in Pep Guardiola’s words, was missing from the City team with a knee injury and will continue to be missing until the new year. In his absence, the feeling went, City fell to pieces at the back. Coming under particular scrutiny was the partnership of John Stones and Nicolás Otamendi in central defence. With both players making prominent errors would Guardiola really persist with them, with so much at stake and Liverpool already five points clear in the Premier League?So that’s that, then. Except. While Stones and Otamendi have played many games for City, they have done so together on few occasions. Saturday’s defeat was just the fourth time they have played as a pair since Laporte’s arrival in January 2018. Guardiola believes in his team and knows they have the capacity to learn and refocus. But he has not sought to persevere with this partnership in the past.Often when Guardiola talks the conversation comes back to himself and there will be things he has to deal with too. He says his team spend every day on the training ground, “almost every day”, trying to correct the flaw that sees them exposed at the near post from corners, the source of Norwich’s opening goal. This will need to continue. He may also have to take measures to make sure his best players are less subject to rotation. Kevin De Bruyne, whose form had been league-leading prior to the international break, was left on the bench after playing two matches for Belgium but it was only after his introduction on the hour that City upped their tempo.Being part of one of the world’s richest and most successful clubs has its upsides, but also its unique challenges. And not every one can be solved by opening the chequebook. After retaining the title so impressively last season there is a mental challenge involved in going again and Guardiola says the team struggled equally against Bournemouth as they did against Norwich, not to mention the points dropped against Spurs. Guardiola is right to suggest that the answers must come from within. Perhaps a wake-up call in September is no bad thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46f5bfaa27f9d6e62a0a63e26080cbe75166e044/0_104_3557_2132/master/3557.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1746e28435e83a15ffdea25873533d20","title":"lia walti arsenal womens super league","story":"The Arsenal midfielder is eager for a return to action after a painful period in which she suffered serious injury and then had to cope with the death of a Switzerland teammateLia Wälti is no stranger to pain. The small tattoo behind her ear, the earth with a Saturn-style ring around it, was the result of a bit of a fascination with the feeling.“Oh no, don’t ask me, I’m not a tattoo person, I don’t know why I did that,” she says with a laugh. “I wanted to see how it feels, you know, because everyone says it is so painful, but it wasn’t. I’m glad I can’t see.”With that somewhat trivial dalliance, pain this year has been a much more serious and dominant feature of the Arsenal midfielder’s career. From missing out on World Cup qualification with Switzerland in a play-off against the Netherlands for the final European place, to a promising season stunted by injury, and the death of an international teammate, Wälti wears the burdens of a more testing season than usual well.The 26-year-old is unlikely to feature in the Arsenal squad that travels to Manchester United on Monday night but is finally back in full training after seven months on the sidelines having sustained knee ligament damage while on international duty in January.“The whole summer was pretty hard. But the team trained really hard, many sessions and really good pre-season tests against world-class teams, which we unfortunately mostly lost, but I think it showed us what we had to still work on.”The pain of initially being told she was out for four weeks, before surgery was deemed necessary in April, has gone, though. “I’m actually not that gutted any more. I had my time where I had my downs. It was probably harder for me to see the last games of the season, I wanted to be part of it, to lift the trophy and to be also a bit longer part of it than just the first half of the season.”Despite the injury she did take to the pitch as the Gunners claimed their first league title in seven years at Borehamwood but the photo that stung, and stayed with fans, was not the trophy lift but Wälti arm in arm with teammates Jordan Nobbs, Viki Schnaderbeck, Danielle Carter and Tabea Kemme all with knees raised and trousers rolled up showing their surgical scars.“I’ve never really experienced anything like that,” Wälti says of the injury crisis that forced the team to make the league a priority over cup campaigns as they limped towards the season’s close. “Last season was really, really hard. And I’m even more proud when I think about what we reached in the end.“Because there was a time between November and January, where we mostly had just 11 or 12 players and we won almost every game and I think that can make us proud. That shows how big the quality in the team is.“The mood changes a bit in a team when something like that happens. I think last season it made us even stronger. And we just try to win for these people who couldn’t play and I hope we’re not going to have this bad luck this season with injuries.”There is one benefit, though, that with title retention extremely tough there is a layer in the team hungry to contribute more significantly. “I hope that every person that iswas injured comes in with a positive energy. I know that Jordan Nobbs is buzzing to be back. When you can’t touch the ball for so long you just enjoy everything.“I also have had my own first experience now of long-term injury. I think, for me personally, in one way it was a bad experience but in another way it was also a good experience, because I know what people go through. I didn’t know that before. You just see people recover from an ACL or whatever and you try to understand them, but you don’t. And I feel like that can also make you a bit stronger mentally. And yeah, if everyone is a little bit mentally stronger than last season, then that will surely help us this season as well.“And we just try to win for these people who couldn’t play and I hope we’re not going to have this bad luck this season with injuries.”Winning for those who are suffering or have suffered is a theme that follows her into the national team. The death on 29 June of the 24-year-old Switzerland midfielder Florijana Ismaili, whose body was recovered days after she had ed off a boat into Lake Como but not resurfaced, is something with which the young group have to grapple.“It’s something you never wish for,” says Wälti. “I never had the experience before, luckily, and I hope won’t happen again. I don’t really know how a team reacts to that. We need to see. But we are all together to look forward and to win for her.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a71884887cd8391747d886174869d82305424f1b/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70f741944dc2da9576ae672faa5069b6","title":"premier league 10 talking points from the weekend action","story":"Buendía the architect of City’s bad day, Arsenal were woeful in defence and Maguire deserved better from Leicester fansThe way in which Norwich turned a negative into a positive was quite something. With nigh-on a full team of players out injured, the odds of stopping Manchester City looked insurmountable. Instead Daniel Farke’s men gave their best performance of the season by far, not only cutting the champions open but looking solid at the back for the first time. There was kudos for the debutants in defence, Sam Byram and Ibrahim Amadou, but also for more seasoned Norwich players. Emi Buendía and Marco Stiepermann were central to a buccaneering style in the Championship yet had struggled to bring that form to the top flight. With the gauntlet down, however, they delivered. Buendía contributed two assists and regularly sprung the City press. Stiepermann sparked several counter attacks and crucially reestablished his understanding with Teemu Pukki. Paul MacInnesThere is a fine line between repeating an experiment until you reach perfection, and continuing it out of stubborn stupidity when the ingredients are clearly wrong. Which camp do you sit in where Arsenal, whose insistence on playing from the back was calamitous against Watford, and Unai Emery are concerned? They had flirted with danger several times before, in a near-action replay of Manchester City’s ridiculous third concession against Norwich, Sokratis Papastathopoulos’s sloppiness allowed Tom Cleverley to hand Watford a lifeline. Bernd Leno could be seen booting the ball long from a goal-kick, to cheers from the away fans, shortly afterwards but Ainsley Maitland-Niles almost let the home team in again later on as Arsenal tried to play short again. The new rule that allows players to receive a goal-kick inside the area has been grasped enthusiastically by many managers but it is not heresy to remind them you do not have to take advantage of it – particularly if your players are not up to the job. Nick AmesOle Gunnar Solskjær said Harry Maguire would not be too unsettled by the rancour he encountered from the away end at Old Trafford. And there are so many precedents – to cite just one example, the Blackburn fans’ treatment of Alan Shearer after the player had left Ewood Park – nobody should have been wholly surprised by the reception for Maguire from the section of Leicester fans. All the same, it did feel perplexing that a player could serve a club with distinction, as Maguire did for Leicester, then leave for £80m, taking care to handle a delicate situation in the right manner and earning the respect of his colleagues in the process, then become public enemy No 1 with their supporters. Maguire can reflect on a satisfying day, making it a frustrating occasion for Jamie Vardy, but he would be entitled to wonder why his first game for United against his old club took place against that kind of ill feeling. Daniel TaylorOne school of thought last season was that Son Heung-min becomes a more incisive player when Harry Kane is not in the Tottenham side. Son often starred in a central role if Kane was out with an ankle injury and his performances seemed to dip whenever the team’s star striker returned, leading to talk that the South Korean forward needed to be given more freedom by Mauricio Pochettino. But the relationship between Kane and Son appeared to be in fine working order during this win. They were both excellent and their link play showed they are more than capable of flourishing in the same attack, especially when they combined brilliantly for Erik Lamela’s goal. There were also two dashing goals from Son and although Kane failed to get on the scoresheet, the England captain’s intelligent performance was a reminder of his impressive team ethic. Jacob SteinbergThe season began for Wolves with a lot of optimistic talk about whether they might be able to go one better than last season and break into the top six. They had shown they could beat the big sides surely it couldn’t be that hard to maintain that but start winning against the teams in the bottom half of the table as well. But five games in, Wolves are still without a league victory. Although they improved drastically after half‑time, there was an odd passivity to them in the first half. Nuno Espírito Santo denied the Europa League was an issue, as he probably has to, but this is a recurring pattern. If nothing else, it has forced him to chop and change his team in a way that he didn’t last season. Wolves surely are too good to be seriously involved in a relegation scrap, but there needs to be an improvement soon. Jonathan Wilson After nine months out, it was as if Lewis Cook had never been away. The Bournemouth midfielder returned to action with the kind of tenacity and grit that truly makes Eddie Howe’s side tick, not to mention the 22-year-old’s wonderful palette of passing. Cook orchestrated things before being given a well-earned breather 13 minutes from time. A standing ovation followed suit, with Howe equally enthused. “Incredible,” Howe said. “He handles the ball in any situation and you saw early in the match how he manipulated himself out of some really difficult holes.” With the summer recruits Lloyd Kelly, 20, and Arnaut Danjuma, 22, yet to make their debut for the club, there are reasons to be cheerful. “When we have more options, with some of the outstanding young players we have out injured, it’s going to be an exciting team to manage,” Howe said. Ben FisherDominic Calvert-Lewin can certainly do a job in the Premier League, but if Everton want to move up the table it might be time for Marco Silva to consider starting Moise Kean for a run of games. Calvert-Lewin is happy to chase and battle but does not currently possess the requisite qualities to make him into a lone striker, despite his goal at Bournemouth. Kean, on the other hand, came off the bench at the Vitality Stadium and, along with fellow substitute Bernard, made Everton look more dynamic in the final third, even if they failed to provide the goals necessary to get back into the game. Kean is a young striker and has just arrived from Italy, so will need time to settle but he could adapt far quicker by being on the pitch and learning about the Premier League, rather than taking inspiration from his Everton colleagues. Will UnwinChalk came up against cheese on the south coast with a meeting of two clubs trying to consolidate their mid-table status by opposite means: Brighton through the pass‑and‑move blueprint of Graham Potter, Burnley by the no-frills ferocity of Dycheball. And as Brighton hogged possession while Burnley sent searching balls towards their strapping forwards, the game largely played out as expected. There was a certain irony, then, that the visitors’ late point came from a move of crisp one-touch passing, Matej Vydra’s flicked lay‑off slammed home superbly by Jeff Hendrick. Brighton’s eight-game winless run at the Amex Stadium may seem like cause for concern but Potter’s early tweak here – switching to a back four after a tepid opening half an hour – and the dominance it heralded suggests that his methods will serve them well in the long run. Alex HessThe officials were booed off, perhaps predictably given VAR had ruled out a Sheffield United goal for a fractional offside, failed to award a penalty when the ball hit James Ward-Prowse’s arm and not even managed to come to Billy Sharp’s aid when his studs lightly raked Stuart Armstrong’s shin. Yet though unpopular, two of the decisions were technically correct and the other endlessly debatable. “VAR is a fantastic tool, it makes the game fairer,” Ralph Hasenhüttl said.

That’s when I learned of the life-altering measures required to fix the problemIn these weird political times, I hear a lot of people saying, “Can things get any worse?” I usually scoff and tell them “Yes. Yes they can.” Things can always get worse, and I’ve learned this lesson the hard way – from bedbugs.For the past 10 years I’ve produced a podcast called RISK!, where people tell true stories too intense or explicit for broadcast radio. Some are a laugh riot, but others keep me up at night.Over time, I began to notice that the scarier stories on the show have an uncanny tendency to include these insect parasites. It’s typical of someone to start with a line like, “The summer my mom died, my career collapsed. But the worst part was getting bedbugs.”This recurring theme got me worried – and they say worrying is like praying for what you fear. I’m a kinky polyamorous gay man, so it could have been that sleeping around was how I got bedbugs in the first place. But having more than one partner was also how I figured out the insects were after me.Several years ago, I woke up in my bed next to my friend Kai, a sculptor I was sleeping with. I had just finished making a pot of coffee in the kitchen when he stumbled in, looking shook.“See these marks on me? What are they?” Small red dots ran down his torso. I went numb with deja vu. A week prior, another fella I was dating complained about the same marks, but I’d assumed a mosquito was to blame. “Fuck!” I said. “I hope this isn’t what I think it is!” I ran back to the bedroom and yanked up the mattress to peek at the box spring. There it was. A bunch of little black stains, like someone had taken a thin Sharpie and dotted the fabric. Then I looked a little closer and saw something worse: something brown, oval, and moving. I trapped it on a little piece of masking tape and started Googling to find out what it was.Kai fled the scene, while I fell into the Heart of Darkness of Google spirals. I learned that the little black dots on the fabric were feces and that the contents of those droppings were mostly my own blood. Turns out, not everyone will have a reaction to a bedbug bite, so this had gone on for some time without my knowing. Two people that sleep in the same bed can be bitten by bugs and one might break out with red marks while the other might not.That’s why that bug I found was was so big. He’d been feasting on me for weeks but my skin hadn’t shown it. Did you know bedbugs inject an anesthetic into you, a numbing chemical, so when they do start sucking your blood, you don’t know? Here’s another fun fact: we have no idea what, if any, purpose bedbugs serve in the ecosystem.As I was going all hot and cold with panic, I remember saying out loud, “But this is like crabs, right? I’ve survived crabs before!” Gentle reader, they’re not. The natural habitat of pubic lice is pubic hair, which is a thing that grew on peoples’ bodies till the 1990s. But bedbugs can hide in mirrors, bookshelves, wall units, books, computers, phones, clocks, remote controls, and most importantly, walls.I was turning up so much contradictory information that I finally ran to Barnes and Noble to pick up a “definitive” tome called The Bed Bug Survival Guide, only to find mixed messages there too. The notes I took that day are filled with insane stuff like this: “For a few months after spotting bugs, you should require all guests to your home to strip nude in the hall before entering your premises and to keep their clothes quarantined in garbage bags away from the walls in the hall.” I have a reputation for being as kinky as they come, but even I couldn’t get away with that sort of hospitality. Another one was: “For the rest of your life, if you absolutely must enter a hotel room, keep everything you own in the bathtub!” I remember one source saying, “Vacuum vacuum vacuum! All couches, drapes, and table cloths!” Then a few pages later, it said to be careful about vacuuming because “that’s a surefire way to spread eggs into other parts of the home!”I’m a recovering Catholic, so I couldn’t help but think: “I’m being punished. I must have brought this plague on myself!” I spent the rest of the day texting any guy I’d slept with in months with variations of “Honey! Check your stuff because I might have given you something!” You won’t find that in How to Win Friends and Influence People. As I rifled through contacts, I began obsessing over one incident a couple months past. I met this guy on a BDSM website. I said we could play at my place, but he said, “Wouldn’t it be kinky if we were to have sex in this sleazy pay-by-the-hour motel I heard about in the shadiest part of Queens?” All kink play requires negotiation. This is where I should have said to myself, “Am I agreeing this because it’s hot to me too, or just because he has a sweet booty?” It was the booty.Lucky for him, I guess, the motel was just as sordid as he’d said. Ancient straight porn played on the TV. Everything looked and smelled like it had been the same since 1974. I’d left my backpack at the foot of the bed. Had the bag become like a Trojan horse for transferring tiny motel residents into my home? Probably not. I’m always traveling for work, so any of a half-dozen other hotels might have been the culprit. Still, this paragraph made me feel itchier than the rest. But there was also that whole thing about bedbugs going through walls. Milos, my landlord, was a big-bellied man, always wearing flashy suits and chomping on cigars. He stared menacingly at passersby from his window. Everyone in the building knew Milos spent a fortune on his own ground floor apartment, and peanuts on ours above. When I told him this situation needed fixing, he charitably replied that it was my problem.I ended up paying a bargain-rate exterminator $500 for a fumigation. When he was finished, he said, “That’ll do it!” It didn’t. A month later, I found bugs in the living room. They were like an army that had set up camp several miles from their target. Then the couple across the hall from me revealed they had bugs too. We teamed up to implore the landlord to treat the whole building. But Milos would not relent. I paid Miguel another $500 for an extermination, and so did the folks across the hall. “That’ll do it!” Miguel told us. It didn’t. One day I was recording my podcast in the sound booth, this tiny wooden box I had built off the side of my kitchen. The walls of it were covered in sound-proofing foam. I’d just finished whining into the mic about how exhausted I was from my paranoia that the bugs were all around me now. Suddenly, I became like the guy in the movies looking for the monster, who whispers: “He’s right behind me, isn’t he?” I got the idea to peel back one of the panels of sound proofing-foam glued to the walls of the booth. The whole booth was crawling with them.That became Chainsaw Day. That’s what I call it now. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I’m so clumsy, I should be nowhere near the driving wheel of a vehicle or the on-button of a power tool. But that day, I rushed to the hardware store, rented a chainsaw, and decimated every piece of furniture I owned. And I kept finding bugs! It’s important to remind ourselves what we’re grateful for. Looking back at Chainsaw Day, I’m grateful I still have limbs. But heat is another way to kill them, so I lost piles of books by accidentally setting them all on fire in the oven. Who really knows the right temperature for cooking books?I couldn’t afford to move, but decided I had to. The day I finally found a new place to move into – almost four months after I’d found that first bug – that was the day Milos began acting like a landlord should. The woman living downstairs from me told him she had bugs now too, and Milos finally realized the army was marching his way. He had the whole building exterminated.But two weeks later, right before moving day, I did something bad, and I’m here to tell you, I don’t regret it. I lied. I insisted to Milos that I’d found one more bug! I hadn’t. I hadn’t seen a bug in weeks. But I desperately wanted a fourth extermination, and now Milos was just as paranoid as I. He couldn’t help but agree to foot the bill. The big lie was my way of being quadruply sure that before I loaded anything I owned onto a U-Haul to flee Brooklyn, I’d really and truly be moving bug free.Then again, maybe I’ve been fooling myself these past five years. You never can be sure what’s lurking in the walls of those U-Hauls. They’re right behind me, aren’t they?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f27c3c760a23c566544fb0c90cd38d47feaa7221/0_200_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff40e47fc7d585b3ed6afd6349c1fee2","title":"five ways to start saving from paying yourself first to premium bonds","story":"It doesn’t matter how little you put away, the trick is to get started. From clever apps to canny tips, here’s a guide to getting into good habits … while still having money for a flutter Rather than treating savings as an afterthought, set up a standing order into a separate account as soon as you get paid, says Anna Bowes, the co-founder of Savings Champion. “That way it can become just another bill, but one that you will benefit from in the future.”Jasmine Birtles, the founder of MoneyMagpie, calls it paying yourself first. “Everyone says they have no money at the end of the month to put into savings,” she says. “That’s why you have to put the money into a savings account at the beginning of the month.”It doesn’t matter how much it is, says Bowes, as long as you start. Some savings accounts accept payments from just £1.While most finance experts advocate saving into a pension, retirement should not be your only goal. Shorter-term goals may be more motivating. If you usually pay for your holiday by credit card and pay it back over months, consider saving for it in advance.Many banks let you set specific markers that show you how much progress you are making towards your target. When you have ticked off one goal, keep saving for the next.Birtles recommends the “savings jars” offered by digital banks such as Monzo and Starling, which allow you to separate money from your current account, but move it back easily if you need it. Many of these banks also let you set spending limits – either overall daily maximums or for different categories of purchases – then round up your spending to the nearest £1 and squirrel away the difference.There are also apps that may help kickstart a savings habit. Chip, for example, makes automatic “microsavings” based on how much you are spending. Birtles suggests Moneybox, which lets you put small amounts into an investment Isa. There are fees, she warns, “but it’s still worth doing as it gets you into stock market investing with just 50p here and there.”If you find a savings account linked to your current account too easy to plunder, open one at a different bank and pick one without a cash card. You could even destroy the online login details if you really don’t trust yourself.Alternatively, go for an account that restricts your access. Regular savings accounts often have terms and conditions that you need to stick to. “That could discourage skipping deposits and making withdrawals,” says Bowes.Premium bonds may not be fashionable or hi-tech, but every bond you own has the chance of winning you up to £1m. Though you are likely to get better returns from a good savings account, you need just £25 to buy bonds, and they are a bit of a faff to cash in, which should help you resist withdrawing your cash. Plus there’s always the hope that next month could be your lucky one …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2ba09ed0103fbdda4c38fda0b719710b4323b80/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4784e9b3be0a2ee0c23fe230e47be21","title":"tv entering second wave of disruption claims bbc chief","story":"Tony Hall believes arrival of new streaming services by likes of Disney will be opportunity for the broadcasterBBC director-general Tony Hall believes that the television industry is about to enter “a second wave of disruption” because of new entrants in the streaming market.However, Lord Hall said the changes presented an opportunity for the BBC and that people would still choose it for “ethical reasons”. He believed the main impact of newcomers such as Disney and Apple could be on established services such as Amazon and Netflix.Addressing an audience at the Royal Television Society convention in Cambridge on Thursday, he will say: “Our industry is about to enter a second wave of disruption. The first was about the rise of Netflix, Amazon and Spotify: market shapers that fundamentally changed audience behaviour, often at the cost of huge losses or massive cross-subsidy.“The second wave will see a range of new entrants entering an already crowded market. We saw it last week as Apple announced their new subscription service. Disney, Hulu and others are to follow. This is, of course, great for audiences. Possibly.”He claims that the libraries of Amazon and Netflix are “likely to shrink, as programme-makers pull their content away from these services to place them on their own”, adding: “The established streamers will need to fight harder to offer the value they currently give today.”Lord Hall will argue that rather than being a threat, this “second wave of disruption” is an opportunity for the BBC to offer an even better service to the public.Saying that services like iPlayer and BBC Sounds are growing at a rapid rate, he will point to the BBC adding a host of new features to iPlayer.“In this market, services that are distinctive and different will stand out. And two vital things make us different. Firstly, we have a unique mission and purpose, all audiences – young and old – believe in it.“Purpose and values matter today more than ever, as people pick and choose services for ethical reasons as much as economic ones. Secondly, no one offers the range of content, in so many genres, on so many platforms, as the BBC.“We’re not Netflix, we’re not Spotify. We’re not Apple News. We’re so much more than all of them put together.”Answering commentators who have argued that the BBC can only lose ground with the young, Lord Hall will discuss how services like BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds are starting to turn the tide.“In the space of a year iPlayer’s reach to young audiences is up by a third,” he will say.“There is really promising growth right across the piece. And that’s before we roll out our full plans for extended availability and exclusive content.”He adds that a year on from its launch, BBC Sounds is reaching nearly two million users a week.The Royal Television Society convention takes place in Cambridge from September 18 to 20."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32a3b634271946055a5d5fbb456acb500e3f7736/0_682_3548_2129/master/3548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f687b1d6d42b18f3c99b395cecf9ac2e","title":"virgin active gym membership contract cancel","story":"I stopped my direct debit after 12 moths was up, but it tried to impose a rolling dealI took out two consecutive 12-month memberships with Virgin Active. With the second none of the terms and conditions were confirmed and no new contract was signed but a fee agreed for the 12 months. At the beginning of this year I wanted to cancel as I hadn’t been using the gym but decided to wait until the end of my contract to let Virgin Active know I didn’t wish to renew. When I didn’t receive any correspondence that my contract was due to end, I checked the emails from when I agreed to commit to another 12 months, and found that I had less than two weeks left. I emailed but got no reply so I cancelled my direct debit. Once I did this, my gym got in touch but refused to cancel my membership, insisting I continue with a rolling contract at an increased cost. I have now received correspondence from a debt collection agency asking for nearly £154. One month’s fee should only be £49.99 so I’m unsure how it came to this figure. It seems that Virgin Active has ignored my request to cancel my contract and was also trying to impose new terms and conditions. I hadn’t used the gym for at least the last month of my 12-month “contract”.LD, Wrexham, North WalesYour letter highlights a crucial issue with gym memberships.

No one was deprived of their British citizenship between 1973 and 2002 but its use escalated from four cases in 2014 and five in 2015 to 14 in 2016 and 104 in 2017.High-profile iniduals who have been deprived of their citizenship include Begum, a British-born woman who left the UK in February 2015, aged 15, to join Isis, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, alleged members of the so-called Beatles cell within Isis, a group of British jihadists responsible for the execution of hostages, and the Muslim convert Jack Letts, who is suspected of leaving Britain to join the terror group.Christine Jardine, the home affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, will call for an overhaul of the powers to introduce a requirement by the home secretary to apply to a court to revoke citizenship.A shake-up of the policy would stop the power being used on anyone who was a British citizen at birth, such as Begum, and a requirement that the best interests of any child affected must be taken into account. Begum reportedly had three children after she fled to Syria, all of whom died.Jardine, who will move the motion at the party’s conference in Bournemouth, said: “The decision to strip someone of their citizenship is a very serious one and should only be taken when absolutely necessary. Instead, we have seen Conservative home secretaries abuse this power for political gain with tragic results.“These are people brought up, often born here, with families and loved ones who deserve a government that will take responsibility when they are radicalised and go abroad to join terrorists. They should be prosecuted in the UK for their crimes and interrogated to learn exactly how this happens and prevent terrorists from recruiting more young Brits.“Liberal Democrats demand better. We will introduce new safeguards so that home secretaries must show good reasons for revoking someone’s citizenship. We will also ensure that the best interests of any children involved are taken into account, and that no one is left stateless.”The decision by the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, to strip Begum of her citizenship was met with broad criticism due to her age and apparent vulnerability.A Church of England bishop and a former director of public prosecutions led the chorus of outrage directed at Javid as demand grew for him to review his controversial decision to strip the 19-year-old of British citizenship. The move is being challenged by Begum’s family in the courts.The parents of Letts, who was a dual Canadian national, called Javid’s decision to strip their son of his British citizenship “cowardly”. The couple were convicted in June this year of funding terrorism after sending their son £223.The Lib Dem motion also calls on the UK to ratify the 1997 European convention on nationality, which prevents states from making people stateless unless their citizenship was obtained through fraud.The Lib Dem motion calls for the power to be restricted to to naturalised citizens only in cases of fraud or when the iniduals or when the inidual “has done something seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the United Kingdom, and deprivation of citizenship is a proportionate response to such conduct and necessary for the national security of the United Kingdom”.The party also wants the government to publish annual reports on its use of this power, and the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation to review its use at least once every three years.A Home Office spokesperson said: “Decisions on depriving a dual national of citizenship are based on substantial advice from officials, lawyers and the intelligence agencies and all available information. This power is one way we can counter the terrorist threat posed by some of the most dangerous iniduals and keep our country safe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/851c49f3d066c0b18e2e77c76c49431a46f31430/0_394_6591_3955/master/6591.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca837319408447b7d391fb0936bf3db9","title":"people have lost faith support labour ebbs away blair sedgefield","story":"Brexit and Corbyn mean party cannot count on traditional vote in former PM’s old constituencyThere are many in Sedgefield who did much for Tony Blair during his 24 years as MP for the County Durham constituency. But it was only Stephen Elliott who agreed to sacrifice his spare bedroom window for the then prime minister, his neighbour in the former mining village of Trimdon Colliery.“When George Bush landed his helicopter here in 2003, I let the American secret service take over the back bedroom. They took the glass out and had snipers up there when the president and his wife went in to see Tony and Cherie,” said the 60-year-old builder as he ate sausage and mash in his garden on Thursday.Elliott, whose late father was on the local Labour party executive during the Blair era, saw Nigel Farage on Wednesday’s news telling a marquee full of Brexiters at Sedgefield racecourse that he was declaring an “all-out political war” on the Labour party. It was a threat greeted with cheers by several hundred local Brexiters, many former Labour voters, who had all paid £5 for this audience with the Brexit party leader.The Labour party cannot rely on the north-east any more, conceded Elliott. Even he did not think he could bring himself to vote Labour when the general election rolls around, and will probably abstain. “To be honest, it’s Jeremy Corbyn,” he said. “He’s not the right leader … There are lots of Labour supporters I know who won’t vote Labour because of Jeremy Corbyn.”Farage was rebuffed by the Conservatives this week when he suggested an electoral pact to beat Labour which would see the Tories stand down in seats where – to quote Farage’s press officer, Gawain Towler – “no one has ever kissed a Tory but they kissed us in the Euro elections and voted heavily leave”.Labour ought to have breathed a sigh of relief when a senior Tory said Farage would not be allowed “anywhere near government” because he was not a “fit and proper person”.More than a quarter of the centre’s clients need help because of benefit delays, particularly universal credit – a Tory invention which has resulted in new claimants waiting up to six weeks for payments. And yet it is Labour many seem to blame. “I don’t think Labour is as strong as it used to be,” said 81-year-old Joyce Raine. So much of the industry has gone, she said, conceding that “Thatcher started it but Labour doesn’t seem to have done much to stop it”.Back on Front Street in Trimdon Colliery, 21-year-old Kieron Naylor was getting ready for his shift at Hitachi Rail Europe, a Japanese-owned firm that builds 35 trains a month for the EU market from the north-east’s biggest manufacturing park in Newton Aycliffe.Naylor voted leave, ignoring warnings that exiting the EU could cause problems for Hitachi’s European exports. “I would just rather we were back on our own,” he said. “It’s a risk … but it should make it easier to have closer relations with Japan.” In a general election he would vote Conservative, he said. “People have lost their faith in Labour. I would definitely not vote for them now, not since Jeremy Corbyn. I just don’t trust him. I would probably vote for the Tories. I think the only people around here now who are against them are the miners, the die-hard Labour people.”His view contrasts with research from the University of Bristol this week, which concluded there are “very high levels of antipathy” towards the Conservatives among voters who backed Labour in 2017, no matter how they feel about Brexit.The tribal Labour vote has not totally died out in Sedgefield. In the Trimdon Colliery and Deaf Hill workmen’s club, Denise Hutchinson, 47, whose claim to fame is that she once beat Tony Blair at darts, said she would be sticking with Labour: “I’ve always voted Labour. My grandad worked down the pit. I’m not really into politics but I will carry on with Labour.”In his driveway just around the corner, a former miner, James Skelton, 88, and his wife, Anne, 82, said they would opt for the Brexit party this time. “I don’t class myself as English any more. I’m being made into a European. I have always voted but we are losing our identity,” he said. “I believe Europe is destroying us. I would prefer to be a satellite of America than Europe.”When Blair stood down in 2007, he gathered the world’s media to Trimdon’s Labour club for his resignation speech. The club closed in 2010 and is now a carpet shop.Inside, Paula Brown said she may vote for the Brexit party, despite voting remain in 2016. “I’ve no faith in any of them. I would never in a million years vote for Jeremy Corbyn. I would rather vote Tory, even Lib Dem.” Corbyn, she said, was “IRA”, and frightened her: “I would rather have Piers Morgan as prime minister. I know it seems mad, but he’s consistent and isn’t afraid to say what he thinks. Nigel Farage cuts through in the same way.’”She sent a colleague down to the basement to find some of the Labour “bumpf” the party left behind: a biography of Blair’s local fixer, John Burton, and flyers put out in 2010 by Phil Wilson, Blair’s successor as Sedgefield’s MP.Wilson knows he has not done himself any favours locally by being vocally in favour of remaining in the EU and having a second referendum. He finds himself caught in a perfect storm, faced with constituents who hate his party leader andor want to leave the EU soonest, with or without a deal. One of those factors is problematic two pose him an existential threat.But he says he is not too worried about losing his seat. “I’m more worried that we have a no-deal Brexit or that we have a Brexit of some description without the people having a chance to confirm they want to go along with that deal,” he said.“Otherwise in a few months or a year’s time, when the jobs are starting to go and there is problems at the border, they have an absolute right to turn around and say: ‘Hang on a minute, we didn’t vote for this.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3d4cd2a24a5af8a64504677853b19877330bdda/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c6024b3a29a1f62d21b94e0b1e83e5a","title":"new york ban sales flavored e cigarette","story":"Governor Andrew Cuomo announces ‘emergency executive action’ amid a surge in youth vaping New York governor Andrew Cuomo on Sunday announced an “emergency executive action” to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarette products, amid a surge in both youth vaping and concern over its health effects.“Manufacturers of fruit and candy-flavored e-cigarettes are intentionally and recklessly targeting young people, and today we’re taking action to put an end to it,” said Cuomo.The governor said New York’s top health official would convene an emergency meeting with the state’s public health council this week, to ban the products.“Names like, ‘Bubblegum’, ‘Cotton Candy’, ‘Captain Crunch’,” Cuomo said, “these are obviously targeted to young people and highly effective at targeting young people.”Tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarette products would not be banned, Cuomo said.The governor also said authorities would target stores selling such products to underage persons, warning: “Those retailers are now on notice that we are ramping up enforcement and they will be caught and prosecuted.”In Washington, Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that his administration will propose a federal ban on thousands of e-cigarette flavors.“People are going to watch what we’re saying and parents are going to be a lot tougher with respect to their children,” Trump said.At least six confirmed deaths have been connected to vaping across the US – in addition to more than 450 cases of reported lung issues.Repeatedly calling vaping “dangerous”, Cuomo said: “It is addicting young people to nicotine at a very early age and nicotine is highly addictive. It doesn’t even matter what product you are using. It is getting young people addicted to nicotine.”He said that while vaping was “technically” better than smoking, “the only situation, in my mind, factually, that justifies vaping is if you had a person that said, ‘I currently smoke, and I have tried every other device to stop smoking. I’ve tried everything. Nothing has worked, except vaping.’”Cuomo said that there had been a debate about whether menthol-flavored e-cigarettes should be banned, and that he and state health commissioner Dr Howard Zucker had discussed the issue.“Dr Zucker feels at this point he is not yet ready to ban menthol,” he said. “Why? There is some data that suggests for menthol cigarette smokers, again who have tried every other device to stop smoking … the menthol flavor for the vaping helps menthol cigarette smokers.”In order for the ban to be implemented, Zucker would make a recommendation to the public health council. If it agrees, there would be a two-week grace period before authorities began stepped up enforcement of retailers.Juul, the largest company in the e-cigarette market, said it was reviewing Cuomo\u0027s announcement – and agreed there was a need for “aggressive category-wide action”.In a statement, a spokesman said the company would “fully comply” with local laws and federal policy. Juul says it stopped selling flavored products in traditional retail stores in November 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/091cafb8eb8d51c28e1c726e6f91c8a1c631ac9b/0_117_3243_1947/master/3243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47c1516340bad9416e74e1a61331d4c5","title":"oxycontin maker purdue pharma files for bankruptcy","story":"Move is partly aimed at halting more than 2,000 lawsuits filed against drug firmUS drug-maker Purdue Pharma has filed for bankruptcy and announced a $10bn (£8bn) plan to settle thousands of lawsuits that accuse the company’s prescription painkiller, OxyContin, of fuelling the deadly opioids crisis.The company, owned by the billionaire Sackler family, faces more than 2,000 lawsuits, including actions from nearly all US states and many local governments, which allege Purdue falsely promoted OxyContin by downplaying the risk of addiction. The public health crisis claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 people between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest US data.The chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, made on Sunday night in White Plains, New York, is designed to halt the lawsuits. Under the proposed settlement, which is backed by about half the states and thousands of local governments that are suing Purdue, the Sacklers will hand the firm’s assets over to a trust controlled by those states, cities and counties. Money generated by the reformed company will be used for drug treatment.The settlement is worth less than the $12bn originally envisaged. The company listed assets of up to $10bn and debts of $1bn in its chapter 11 filing.The Sacklers have agreed to contribute at least $3bn as part of the settlement, from funds generated by selling Purdue’s UK-based subsidiary Mundipharma. Their contribution had become a sticking point during the discussions.Steve Miller, the chairman of Purdue’s board of directors which met on Sunday night to approve the long-expected bankruptcy filing, said: “This settlement framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation, and instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis.“We will continue to work with state attorneys general and other plaintiff representatives to finalise and implement this agreement as quickly as possible.”Purdue said the deal was backed by 24 states and five US territories, as well as lead lawyers for more than 2,000 cities, counties and other plaintiffs.However, two dozen states remain opposed or uncommitted to the proposed settlement. Members of the Sackler family also face lawsuits, seeking billions of dollars in damages, that claim the company and family aggressively marketed prescription painkillers while misleading doctors and patients about their addiction and overdose risks.Purdue and the Sacklers have denied the allegations.Opposing states, including Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut, want the Sacklers to guarantee more of their own money will go toward a settlement, and have questioned Purdue’s calculations valuing the overall deal at more than $10bn. Their opposition could complicate the bankruptcy process.In a statement, members of the Sackler family said they hoped those opposing the current settlement offer would eventually change their minds. “It is our hope the bankruptcy reorganisation process that is now underway will end our ownership of Purdue and ensure its assets are dedicated for the public benefit,” the Sacklers said.“We are hopeful that in time, those parties who are not yet supportive will ultimately shift their focus to the critical resources that the settlement provides to people and problems that need them.”Miller said the company had not admitted wrongdoing and does not intend to. “The alternative is to not settle but instead to resume the litigation,” he said on a conference call with reporters. “The resumption of litigation would rapidly diminish all the resources of the company and would be lose-lose-lose all the way around. Whatever people might wish for is not on the table now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d88ea060bc8056cf12c9cf7072311c330fa9982/0_991_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2300a1fd24f77112b8b1cd915a647564","title":"pms burqa jibes dehumanising says governments extremism adviser","story":"Exclusive: As Commission for Countering Extremism issues major report, Sara Khan calls on politicians to watch their wordsThe government’s chief adviser on extremism has called the language used by Boris Johnson to describe Muslim women demeaning and dehumanising, as she warned that politicians and the media risk provoking violence through their rhetoric.In an interview with the , Sara Khan, who leads the Commission for Countering Extremism (CCE), criticised the use of inflammatory phrases and terms such as “enemies of the people” and “saboteurs” – both of which featured in Daily Mail headlines – in political discourse.Khan, whose role is to advise the government on new policies and powers to deal with extremism, said the word “extremist” itself is being used unhelpfully by MPs on all sides to describe those who hold opposing politics, undermining the fight against hateful narratives against race, religion and sexuality.Last week, Johnson faced humiliation at prime minister’s questions when MPs clapped and cheered the Labour backbencher, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, as he demanded Johnson apologise for the comments and launch a long-promised inquiry into Islamophobia.The “enemies of the people” slur originated from the headline on a November 2016 front-page article in the Daily Mail about three judges who had ruled the UK government would require the consent of parliament to give notice of Brexit. The row resurfaced earlier this week after government sources suggested three Scottish judges who ruled Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament was unlawful were politically motivated.The commission is set to publish its first major report after a year in which Khan and her team have visited 20 towns and cities, sifted through 3,000 responses to a call for evidence and commissioned 19 academics to write papers on issues such as Islamist extremism, the far right and extremism online.A broad range of behaviours were flagged to the commission, including animal-rights and far-left extremism, as well as the more frequently reported upon areas of far-right and Islamist extremism.Khan travelled the country against the backdrop of what she acknowledged are “politically febrile times” but found the contributions made by public figures were undermining efforts to combat extremism.Speaking at Spotlight youth centre in east London, where she was holding a round table with young people about extremism, she said: “We live in a country where we want people to hold different political opinions. I might not agree with your political opinion but we want to live in a country where people have those different political opinions.“Once we start going round using the language of ‘well, you’re an extremist because I don’t like your political opinion’, whether its on Brexit or anything else, equally the language of ‘enemies of the people, traitors, saboteurs’, that’s going to create, and it already is, a climate of censorship. It’s undermining pluralism.“I know passions are high in our country with Brexit and we’re living in politically febrile times but politicians in particular have to be very careful about recognising that and ensuring they don’t use language in a way that could possibly lead to violence in our country and further hate.”Among challenges the commission will highlight in its report are a lack of clarity on defining extremism and a dearth of tools to measure its prevalence in the UK.In its 2015 counter-extremism strategy, the government defined extremism as “the vocal or active opposition to our fundamental values, including democracy, the rule of law, inidual liberty and the mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs”. It adds: “We also regard calls for the death of members of our armed forces as extremist.”Khan said this is too broad and needs to be rewritten, as does the entire strategy. The lack of a legally robust definition of extremism was one of the reasons that an extremism bill touted in the run up to the 2015 general election, complete with civil orders to ban extremist groups, never transpired.Another challenge facing counter-extremism, Khan said, is protecting the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. “Some of the concerns people raised with us we would actually consider to be freedom of expression issues. “I’m not interested in curtailing freedom of expression, what I want to do is to protect freedom of expression and also the rights of other peoples that extremists seek to restrict and undermine.”The report will underline the need for a “whole society” response to tackling extremism.Khan said: “I feel very strongly that government can’t fix everything. So when we’re talking about challenging extremist narratives, extremist ideologies, for me I think civil society has a huge rule to play in this.”There have been recent calls for further legal powers to tackle extremism. The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change proposed new legislation similar to proscription powers for terrorist groups – the power to ban membership and support for specific organisations.But Khan said the commission had not heard a “strong case for more powers”.She added: “There’s a question of whether existing powers are being used appropriately. I don’t think they are. What we’re going to do as part of our future work programme is to review all existing powers.”Asked if the police need to do more, Khan said: “What I want to work with the police more on is to make sure we’re using existing powers in the appropriate way when we see examples of extremism.”Khan’s appointment to the role was met with criticism. She is viewed by some as an establishment figure who has backed isive policies including the anti-radicalisation Prevent programme, which many have argued unfairly targets Muslim communities. The commission itself continues to be attract criticism.Khan said she had become used to backlash and had grown a “thick skin”. “At the end of the day, a lot of these counter-extremists who are challenging far-right groups or Islamist groups or others are doing really vital work and should be supported for that work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c847353cfa3013c0b80f77d2157a33b192ad2a1/0_382_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7646fdb08feb2e8b47f92773fe6b39e9","title":"stop engaging with online trolls altogether public figures say","story":"Group including Eddie Izzard and Gary Lineker backs new guide for victims of online abuseActors, television personalities and politicians are calling on their colleagues to stop giving fuel to online trolls in an effort to stop the spread of hate and abuse online.The former England footballer Gary Lineker, the former home secretary Alan Johnson, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, the anti-FGM campaigner Nimco Ali and the comedian and actor Eddie Izzard are among those uniting on Monday to advise people to stop engaging with trolls altogether online.Izzard told the  that acknowledging them was to effectively hand over a “megaphone” so they could spread their views to an even larger audience.The call by these public figures is part of the launch of a new guide for victims of online trolling called Don’t Feed the Trolls, launched by the new Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH).Johnson told the  that MPs were now afraid of raising certain subjects likely to lead to them being trolled.He said: “Many of my former colleagues in parliament fear speaking out on issues which might trigger another onslaught of trolling.“I worked with the CCDH’s director, Imran Ahmed, on the EU referendum campaign, in which we saw outbreaks of virulent hate offline and especially online, and in which our colleague Jo Cox lost her life to a radicalised white nationalist terrorist.“The CCDH’s Don’t Feed the Trolls report is a brilliant explanation of how we can start the process of cleaning up toxic discourse on social media so we can use it to do good.”Izzard, who has previously spoken about receiving abuse for being transgender, said: “To directly engage with these trolls is to hand them a megaphone.“The world would be a happier and less hateful place if, instead of giving these voices the attention and audience they crave, we all simply blocked and ignored them.”Co-authored by the psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos and Ahmed, the report tells victims to block troll accounts and turn off notifications on their phones when they are being targeted.The public figures backing the report believe responding to trolls on social media – even with a put-down or criticism – spreads hate by amplifying and legitimising their ideas. It also helps trolls attract new followers, and access an audience they would not normally be able to reach.The guidelines suggest that in cases where victims receive messages which they believe may be unlawful, they should record a screenshot of the message, report it to the social media platform, and contact the police or lawyers. It also advises not to post about being the target of trolls.The report references a playbook produced by the US neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, advising online trolls that the best way to gain “media attention and general infamy” was “to troll public figures and get them to whine about it”.The research also cites evidence that trolls are more likely to have personality traits in which they enjoy seeing other people in pain, and so responding or complaining often leads to more abuse.Lineker, host of the BBC’s Match of the Day, said recent incidents of racism directed at black footballers online showed the urgent need for the guide.“We’ve all been shocked by the way in which racist trolls have been targeting footballers recently. It is frankly horrifying that they have done so in a calculated way to spread their abhorrent views. Let’s not allow the beautiful game to be tarnished in this way.“Everyone across the sporting world will be grateful for this guide on how we can show online trolls the red card: don’t rise to the bait block the trolls and take some time out.”Papadopoulos said: “It is perfectly natural for a victim of trolling to want to defend their reputations and values. But it is precisely this instinct that trolls exploit to keep victims engaged and to amplify their hate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d211128e9a12bddc42155706eeb46ded1c30a93/0_158_2314_1387/master/2314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=062adaa15fb08385825d5c449b5eeb50","title":"owen farrell no arms tackles","story":"The England captain, Owen Farrell, has had to change his tackling technique amid fears of a flurry of red and yellow cards at the World Cup. Farrell was involved in two high-profile incidents where no-arms tackles went unpunished last autumn but directives from World Rugby issued at the end of last season state he should have been punished.Eddie Jones has already warned how the World Cup could be “destroyed” by inconsistent refereeing of the tackle area but England’s defence coach, John Mitchell, revealed on Sunday that Farrell has taken measures in training to alter his approach, with the squad on high alert over red and yellow cards.When World Rugby issued its directives Farrell’s shoulder charge on South Africa’s Andre Esterhuizen was used as an example in an accompanying video to demonstrate when a yellow card should be awarded. Farrell was not sanctioned during the match by the referee, Angus Gardner, denying South Africa the chance to kick a penalty at goal with the clock red and condemning them to a 12-11 defeat. Three weeks later Farrell’s no‑arms tackle on Izack Rodda also went unpunished in England’s victory against Australia with the Wallabies furious they were not awarded a penalty try.“John Carrington is very good at the tackle technique, so they’ve just made some adjustments based on that. If your hand is in front of your shoulder then you’ve got a better chance of making a proper wrap tackle. If your shoulder is ahead of your hands then the law probably doesn’t look after you very well. At the back of everyone’s mind there were a lot of cards issued at the U20s world tournament. There will definitely be some apprehension around, ‘OK, is it actually going to be like that?’”Last month New Zealand’s Scott Barrett was sent off for a shoulder charge in the All Blacks’ heavy defeat by the Wallabies and in their final match before the World Cup they chose to play the last 15 minutes of their 92-7 victory against Tonga with only 14 men, removing Ryan Crotty in an effort to practise with a numerical disadvantage. Mitchell revealed that England had planned to do likewise in their record win over Ireland last month and, while circumstances dictated they opted against it, they frequently do so in training.England begin their World Cup campaign against Tonga on Sunday amid doubts over the fitness of Joe Cokanasiga and Mark Wilson, who both have knee problems. Tonga have a somewhat stereotyped reputation for being overly aggressive and Mitchell has warned that sides who do not focus on reducing the tackle height will come unstuck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/843f6f0edb47b021b5e71399b96927dd59cd5a7e/0_477_3467_2081/master/3467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1579e8aa1d953dd8d2ad64f838fd5a66","title":"suzann pettersen solheim cup europe ","story":"Discussion raged for two days over how long players were taking to play Solheim Cup shots. The event has waited 29 years for this, its finest conclusion. If women’s golf, especially in Europe, cannot build upon such theatre then there really is no hope.In the kind of denouement script writers lie awake conjuring up, even the key protagonist was as if hand picked. There was one putt left in the 16th meeting of Europe and the United States. Suzann Pettersen, subject to epic ridicule after a controversial incident during her last participation in this duel, four years ago, had an eight-footer to claim back the cup.Pettersen, 635th in the world after a career break to start a family, versus Marina Alex was the only match still in play. As word spread that Europe, written off Europe, underdog Europe, suddenly had a chance of landing a sucker punch on the United States a sporting world turned its attention as one. The Norwegian exploded with joy as the ball reached the bottom of the cup.Pettersen was soon joined by euphoric teammates, who had been privately resigned to defeat only 40 minutes earlier. Amid that debacle in Germany in 2015, Pettersen spent the aftermath crying in a locked hotel room. To suggest this was an altogether different scene barely paints an appropriate picture. This was the ultimate redemption. It was followed, even more amazingly, by her retirement.“This is it professionally, I’m done,” said the 38-year-old. “This is perfect closure. That’s it, I’m done. This is a good end to a great career.”It remains to be seen whether Pettersen sticks to her plan once emotion subsides but it seems safe to assume that her Solheim Cup run will end at nine. And on the ultimate high.In maintaining a mood of farewell, Juli Inkster confirmed she will call time on US captaincy duties after three stints.Europe 14½, US 13½. A tie would have been sufficient for the US to retain the trophy. Gleneagles staged a gargantuan tussle. From a starting position of 8-8, common consensus was that the greater strength in depth of Inkster’s side would prevail. Instead, Catriona Matthew – so unheralded in British sporting context – presided over a victory that reverberated way beyond Perthshire.“I always had faith in Suzann,” said Matthew. “It was just unbelievable. There has never been a better moment.”If focus understandably centred on Pettersen, the heroics of Bronte Law also require appreciation. The Englishwoman won three of her last four holes against Ally McDonald to seal a 2\u0026amp1 victory. This meant Pettersen’s match mattered.Law had been one down after 10. At that juncture, a tie – or US victory – looked inevitable. Brittany Altomare thumped Jodi Ewart Shadoff 5\u0026amp4 and both Korda sisters, Nelly and Jessica, added to the US tally. As Angel Yin defeated Azahara Muñoz and Lizette Salas took down Anne van Dam by a hole, the European outlook was grim.With the outcome still in the balance, Charley Hull made an awful mess of the 18th when 1up on Megan Khang. This marked the second time Hull had let a winning position slip on the last such margins can, in normal circumstances, determine events such as this. “I feel pretty happy,” said Hull. “I think I was one down with about five or six to play, so to halve the match is not too bad.” This won’t be a candidate for analysis of the year. Thankfully, alas, it barely mattered.Carlota Ciganda had fuelled hopes of an unlikely European win with a 1up success over Danielle Kang in game one. Georgia Hall, outstanding once again in the Solheim Cup, ensured four wins from as many games as Lexi Thompson was seen off 2\u0026amp1. In Thompson’s defence, she had been battling a back problem which had placed her singles appearance in doubt.Anna Nordqvist, out of sorts over the first two days, recovered brilliantly to see off Morgan Pressel 4\u0026amp3. Céline Boutier, like Pettersen a Matthew wildcard pick, was a 2\u0026amp1 victor over Annie Park.Such details are, of course, intrinsically linked to the outcome. Yet the defining moment dwarfed all before it and, inevitably, so much that will follow. In this age, where so many final acts are lazily classed among the greatest ever, this was a genuine jaw-dropper. Farewell, Suzann and thanks for the drama."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddabf0de63b416083d6110108363421d7a2e44b0/101_231_2456_1473/master/2456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87cfd761a2c9c6f8d1d5604d25ec81d2","title":"jonny bairstow england australia ashes","story":"In the end a losing draw felt about right.

It showed at times around a sozzled Oval crowd, baked and frazzled at the end of their own endless cricketing summer – although less so in the sprightly efforts of England’s bowlers, or indeed in Matthew Wade who capped Australia’s series with a brilliant hundred.As the shadows crept across the pitch Wade and Jofra Archer tended to some unfinished business in that final session. Archer bowled eight overs off the reel, fizzing the ball past the nose of his on-field bromance and cranking the speed gun up to 95.6mph, as both men gave this series the valedictory send‑off it deserved.Around the Oval concourses the scene was more louche. There was even a sighting of Trevor Bayliss outside the Veuve Clicquot grog‑van behind the pavilion, England’s head coach meeting a brief social call while the bowlers wrestled with Australia’s late-middle order. He has, in fairness, probably earned a drink.In keeping with that sense of farewells and end times, it must be said Australia approached this match like a hungover house-guest with a train to catch. Bowling first, leaving out two members of their decisive pace quartet, reviewing poorly (they would have come to the Oval 3-0 up but for poor use of the DRS): the urn-holders looked like a team only half in this game.No doubt this will be factored in when the final vying up is made on a drawn series. England are now post-Bayliss, two months from the next Test series and at the start of a new cycle.It feels like a timely cut-off. This England team is a puzzle, packed with talent but muddled by jangling parts and ill-fitting joins. The job of the new coach-captain axis will be to rejig as much as replace and rip out. Above all, there is a need to shift something heavy at the heart of this team, the clog that has mangled the late middle-order, the sense of some well-established, even rather sharp‑elbowed parts that refuse to find their own perfect fit.With this in mind it seemed fitting that Jonny Bairstow was so prominent on this final day. Bairstow kept very well here, leaping about with élan as the quicks pounded in, producing one lightning stumping in the morning and another in late afternoon off Joe Root to get rid of Wade.Stare at the parts long enough and Bairstow is probably the key to balancing this team albeit not in the way he might hope. It was poignant also that the day should be played out under the eyes of Alec Stewart’s Oval office. Bairstow is a brilliant cricketer, and arguably England’s best ever one-day international batsman (look at the numbers and look where his hundreds took England this summer).But he has also become a conundrum in this team, and in his own way a modern-day anti-Gaffer. Stewart’s own career as a Test match wicketkeeper-batsman was marked by selflessness. He wanted to open. England needed him to keep. A great Test top order career (Stewart averaged 46 there) was sacrificed for the collective. By contrast Bairstow has to a degree dictated his own terms. He wants to bat at seven, keep the gloves and retain the comfort of a dual-role place in the team, leaving others to struggle with the more stark challenges of the middle order.Meanwhile, Jos Buttler has yo-yoed up and down the late middle order. A traditional route into the team for younger players at No 6 has been blocked by the knock-on effects. Against this, Bairstow’s returns with the bat have tailed off as a keeper. He averages 28 in the past two years. A grand talent is being allowed to bring its B-game to the party.It is perhaps another echo of the emphasis on white-ball cricket that what Bairstow wants to do should be a factor in how the England Test team is configured. But the batting lineup will need to lose some of those corners before the winter tours.The most obvious move would be to shift Bairstow up to No 5 and tell him to become the problem‑solving middle-order gun he could have been all along, with Root at three, Ben Stokes at four, Ollie Pope at six and Buttler keeping wicket at No 7. Buttler has not yet looked like a complete top-six batsman. But he could be a world class No 7. There is another problem here, too. Despite his fine first-class record, Bairstow averages 30 in Tests as a middle-order player without the gloves, a number that drops to 28 since his return to the team in 2015. Perhaps it really would be more radical to simply let this go.Other parts of the team are coming together. Archer is a sublime talent. Stuart Broad, who really can’t go on for ever, continues to give the impression he might. There is the armature of a fine, eager next-generation Test team here. England have a chief selector with a ruthless eye and a new head coach in the offing. But new beginnings are often a little painful too. That middle order clog, the jostle for position that has unbalanced this team for too long, might just be an excellent place to start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f2e38314cfd9a64c6e47ea0dbe3ff0af09aebb2/2506_478_4994_2996/master/4994.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad76f668026e9eb3750544a8c6ec9a0d","title":"rosie kay fantasia choreographer maximum pleasure into an hour","story":"Trailblazing choreographer Rosie Kay is using the latest research in neuroscience to bring unalloyed joy to her audienceWhen Rosie Kay was starting work on her new dance show, Fantasia, she couldn’t help but notice that every time she went to the theatre, or to see a piece of dance, or just switched on Netflix, everything she saw was dark and depressing. “I just feel there’s a cult of misery,” she says. “Everything’s so gloomy and miserable and everybody’s revelling in it.” It’s not that Kay thinks there’s nothing to be gloomy about in the world right now, “But it’s quite apathetic,” she says. “We go to these luxurious theatres and clap about the misery of the world, but don’t really do anything about it.”Kay, a Birmingham-based choreographer best known for 5 Soldiers – her potent work about the realities of army life – is not one to follow the herd, and she found herself catapulting in the opposite direction. How could she make a dance piece that brought unalloyed joy to the audience? How could she pack the most amount of pleasure into an hour on stage?Reading up on the philosophy of beauty came first: Nietzsche, Kant and the Greeks, the sublime, the link between beauty and truth and “the scene in the Odyssey where Ulysses sees Nausicaa and her beauty alone makes him want to live,” says Kay. “I’d been feeling that beauty was a terribly unattractive thing to be talking about, that it’s seen as superficial. Whereas maybe beauty’s really important for us as humans, to find energy, positivity and reasons for living.”To find some quantifiable truths in her search for beauty, Kay turned from philosophy to science. In 2009, she had taken part in research with neuroscientists at Glasgow University looking at audiences’ aesthetic experiences. In the experiment, Kay created a piece of dance that was performed three times, firstly to classical music, then in silence with just the dancers’ breath sounds, then to electronic music. Viewers watched the pieces live and gave feedback on their responses. They also watched videos of the performances while having a scan of their brain. The scan results showed that the dancing to Bach stimulated parts of the brain related to pattern recognition as the viewers fitted together the movement and the music, whereas when they watched the movement with just the sound of the dancers’ exertion, they had a body to body response, “a physical, visceral response that is related to empathy or body to body connection,” explains Kay.What was interesting was that even with the same bits of the brain lighting up, two different viewers could have very different reactions. Some people love the sense of order when music and movement fit together, some find it boring. Some love the raw and real connection with bodies panting and sweating, others hate seeing the dancers’ effort, they want the fantasy of perfection. In further research these preferences were related to personality traits, so those who liked the visceral, non-musical connection, for example, were likely to score highly for openness – the same trait that means you’re also more likely to enjoy jazz, take drugs and vote for the Green Party.The real upshot of this may be the lesson that you cannot please everyone all of the time. But Kay is going to have a jolly good go. To create Fantasia, she started with a pleasure-filled playlist taking in Bach, Beethoven, Vivaldi, Vaughan Williams and more, then went into the studio and started dancing alone. “There’s a sense of dancing freely from the heart,” she says. She’s now using some of that material to choreograph on three female dancers and working out how to give the audience seriously pleasurable highs, while also upturning expectations (her costume choices so far have included fringed catsuits and transparent gowns, suggesting we might not always be talking about conventional beauty).Kay’s involvement with neuroscience has continued. She’s been absorbing the findings from time spent at Denmark’s Centre for Music in the Brain, where researchers were looking into the powerful pleasure of watching bodies move in unison (along with the immense displeasure that comes from being out of time), in addition to searching for the secret of groove – it’s all to do with syncopation, apparently.She’s also worked with the Oxford neuroscientist Morten Kringelbach, who has identified dance as a key human pleasure, along with music, food, sex and social interaction. “And if you remove one or two of them, that can lead to a much higher inclination towards depression,” says Kay. “So cultivating pleasure in your life is an actual necessity.” Especially when turmoil reigns around us, you might say. “Doing something positive feels like the right thing to be doing at the moment,” she says. “We’ve got to keep fighting for truth and beauty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aaa7667329fab78b92d39c532c07bb804b9357f/463_296_4082_2450/master/4082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f55377757fc10bf71f0af211ea123e20","title":"bose noise cancelling headphones 700 review less business more modern design","story":"Same Bose magic now sleeker, with better controls, calling and adaptable noise cancellingBose’s new top-of-the range 700 noise-cancelling headphones attempt to be the new gold standard, with a new design, new technology and a shift in focus.Launched to sit atop the long-standing kings of noise-cancelling cans, the £300 QuietComfort 35 II, the new £350 Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 look to shift Bose’s rather staid image toward something more modern and fashionable.Out goes the segmented headband and folding arms, and in comes a slimmer, seamless metal band terminating in two arms that slide smoothly through the outside of the ear cups for height adjustment.It’s a sleeker design that removes harsh lines, junctions and breaks. Even the bunching of the ear pads has been smoothed out. The shape of the ear cups forces the headband, which is lined with a soft-touch silicone pad, to sit further back on your head. Wear them too far forward and they’ll slide off.And they no longer fold in half. Instead the ear cups simply rotate, fitting into a wedge-shaped case, which Bose says is thinner at one end than the QC35 II’s and therefore easier to fit into a flight bag. But not folding means they are harder squeeze into an every-day bag without the case. A small step back in my opinion.On the head they feel slightly heavier than the QC35 II. The ear pads are slimmer and the ear cups feel more airy, which helped keep my ears cooler, but they grip the sides of my head noticeably harder. They were comfortable for extended periods, but they didn’t feel as immediately snug and relaxed as the QC35.The controls have been redesigned too. Two buttons on the right take care of power, pairing and voice assistant control – Google Assistant, Alexa or Siri - with advanced Google Assistant or Alexa functionality baked-in if you’d like.A button on the left ear cup controls the noise-cancelling level. Press and hold to activate conversation mode, which pipes in sound from outside so you can talk to someone – although you look exceptionally rude doing so.The new touch controls are the best I’ve used on any headphones, and worked reliably even in inclement weather, but not at all with non touch-enabled gloves. Double tap the Bose logo on the right ear cup to pause or play. Swipe forward or back for track skip, and up and down to adjust volume. Seven full swipes takes you from minimum to maximum volume with a continual progression in between.Connectivity was rock solid to phones and tablets, both Android and iOS. The headphones support Bluetooth 5, but only the SBC and AAC audio codecs. That’s fine for Apple users, because AAC is the highest quality an iPhone or iPad can support, but Android or Windows PC users looking for more advanced formats such as Qualcomm’s aptX series or Sony’s LDAC will have to look elsewhere.Audio latency control was good, with audio and video perfectly in sync with all the major video apps and services, including the often problematic YouTube. Games showed a little bit of audio delay.The Headphones 700 can also connect to two devices at once, which means you can watch a video on an iPad and then take a call on your phone or similar. It worked great with mobile devices, but connecting them to a computer and a phone simultaneously caused audio issues.You can pair lots of devices and hot swap between them using the Bose Music app or you can simply disconnect and reconnect your devices manually using their Bluetooth settings.The original QC35 pushed noise-cancelling technology to the next level and the Headphones 700 match them, competing favourably with Sony’s best, particularly on commutes, handling wind noise better than any other. Turned up to maximum, the noise cancelling is very effective, blocking or diminishing even the most difficult of sudden or loud noises. The difference between the Headphones 700 and even mid-range models is night and day. You get what you pay for.Bose has re-engineered its noise-cancelling system for greater flexibility. Now you can choose from 11 levels from maximum noise blocking to fully open, piping ambient sounds from your environment into the headphones using the microphones on their surface.That means if you want some awareness of what’s happening around you, such as conversations in an office, but without the hum of air conditioning or computers you can adjust the level accordingly. The ambient sound mode is a cut above too, sounding far more natural and open than any other similar technology I’ve used.Press the noise-cancelling button on the left ear cup to switch between three favourite noise-cancelling levels, which default to zero, five and 10. Every time you switch levels or in and out of conversation mode, the noise-cancelling ramps smoothly up and down again like someone turning a big analogue volume knob. It’s a small detail that makes the whole experience feel all the more luxurious.Bose products always have a signature sound that has proven isive in audiophile circles. The Headphones 700 are no different. If you didn’t like how the QC35 or even the original TriPort headphones sounded, you won’t like these.If you do, then you’ll be treated to well-balanced audio with punch in the low end for a fully rounded sound and clarity in the highs to make tracks sparkle. You’ll also hear an almost clinical separation of tones, which allows inidual instruments and notes to stand boldly on their own, not blended into a mush.The Headphones 700 can handle most music genres well, with an easy listening and open sound that’s slightly more spacious than the QC35. Overall they are some of the most consistent and best-sounding headphones you can buy, right up their with Sony’s MX-1000M3.There is no equaliser control yet, but Bose said it was working on the ability to adjust the sound of the headphones as part of its new architecture.Voice calling, as well as voice assistant access, is a new focus for the Bose headphones. Using a series of microphones they perform a similar beam-forming noise cancellation on your voice as smart speakers. The result is clear and loud voice pickup even in the noisiest of environments. If you make a lot of calls or talk to Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri all the time these are for you.The Headphones 700 last just shy of 20 hours between charges when using Bluetooth and noise cancelling turned up to maximum, but longer when used via cable. While not industry leading, given Sony’s MX-1000M3 last in the region of 30 hours. That’s long enough to last a week’s commuting or a transatlantic flight.It takes just under 2.5 hours to charge them via USB-C, which is fairly slow compared to the fast-charging smartphone. A 15-minute quick charge provides over three hours of playback time though, which is handy if you forget to charge them.The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 mark a shift for the company, attempting to erge from a perception of being bought by business travellers towards a design-led luxury offering with a £350 price tag to match.They’re certainly sleeker and more expensive-looking. The way they operate is smoother too, whether it’s the fading and in and out of sound modes or the best-in-class swipe touch controls.They are also the best-sounding Bose headphones to date, with a consistent refined performance. Audiophiles may still be put off by the Bose sound signature. Noise cancelling is top notch, but now adaptable with a sliding scale of levels available, and voice calling or voice assistant control is best-in-class. If you make calls or talk to Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri a lot, these are for you.But part of the seamless design is the removal of folding arms. The ear cups still rotate to flat, but the headphones are harder to fit into a general commuting bag than the QC35. The ear cups feel more spacious and cooler when wearing, but the headband squeezes your head noticeably harder than the QC35, and as a result weren’t quite as comfortable. They are still more comfortable for extended periods than key competition though.The Headphones 700 support Bluetooth 5 for better connectivity, can connect to two devices at once, which is extremely handy, but they struggle connecting to both a computer and a smartphone. Hopefully an update can solve those problems, but stick to mobile devices for now and everything works fine.The lack of higher quality or low-latency Bluetooth audio formats beyond SBC and AAC is slightly disappointing for non-Apple users, and while battery life is solid at just shy of 20 hours, it’s not class leading.They’re pricey, but the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are some of the best headphones you can buy. They just don’t quite transform the market in the same way the original QC35s managed in 2016.Cons: expensive, no aptX etc, bugs with PC connectivity, don’t fold This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Three local experts choose their favourites‘Ramen doesn’t have rules the way many Japanese foods do, which means the possibilities are endless,” says Abram Plaut. “And in Tokyo people are always coming up with ideas that have never been done before.”Plaut’s fascination with the noodle soup started when he arrived in Japan to teach English a decade ago. Ramen was cheap, plentiful and, thanks to the automated ordering machines, easy. He was hooked. But his hobby became an obsession, and within a few years he was writing articles on the subject and appearing on TV as an expert. In 2016, he helped open Mensho Tokyo SF in San Francisco with master ramen chef Tomoharu Shono.Noticing a lack of English-language resources for ramen novices in Japan, Plaut teamed up with friends and fellow noodle aficionados Hiroshi Shimakage and Patrick Brzeski, the Hollywood Reporter’s Asia bureau chief, to launch Ramen Beast, a free-to-use app with hundreds of independent listings designed to help confused outsiders navigate Tokyo’s complex ramen subculture.“The volume and ersity of ramen shops in Tokyo can be overwhelming,” Brzeski says (few have websites), “but it’s also incredibly inspiring.” Between the three of them, he estimates they’ve eaten at several thousand places, ranging from mum-and-dad operations to a Michelin-starred number where bowls come dusted with fresh truffle shavings.“In this one food scene, you could eat a new gourmet meal for under £10 every day for the rest of your life,” Brzeski adds.Out of more than 10,000 ramen joints in the city, here are 10 the trio say should be on your culinary hit list.“Expect premium ingredients artfully crafted into perfectly balanced bowls,” Shimakage says. “The master, Yamamoto-san, is known as one of the first ramen chefs to use hamaguri clams in his signature soup.” These bivalves, along with a touch of sea bream, add an evocative depth to the broth. Although Konjiki Hototogisu became Tokyo’s third ramen joint to win a Michelin star last year, the Ramen Beast crew have been fans of Yamamoto’s shio ramen since he was serving out of a tiny eight-seat shop. Fame hasn’t gone to the master chef’s head, though, or diminished his food’s superb quality. “Light, clean, delicate, yet bursting with umami, this bowl is not one to be missed,” Shimakage says.• 2-4-1 Shinjuku, 22 Kyutei Mansion 1F, Shinjuku, +81 3 5315 4733, daily 11.30am-3pm, 6.30pm-10pm“Once you give your ticket, the guy kneads out the dough and then cuts the noodles fresh, which is somewhat uncommon in the ramen game,” Plaut says. It’s mesmerising to watch these toothsome tangles materialise before your eyes. “This is one of the most famous shops serving kitakata ramen in Tokyo,” Plaut adds. This style, originally hailing from Fukushima prefecture, consists of a clear soup with rustic, wavy noodles laced with a funky undertone of niboshi (dried sardines).• 2 Chome-13-2 Hatchobori, Chuo, +81 3 5566 9355, Mon-Fri 11am-3pm, 5pm-10pm Sat-Sun 11am-3pm, 5pm-9pm, on Facebook“As soon as you walk through the door, you’ll get a blast of this shop’s signature spices,” Plaut says. Order a cold Sapporo to wash down incendiary bowls loaded with fiery ingredients from around the globe. “The soup here references spicy miso ramen, but it has so many exotic flavours melded together that it’s a bowl without a genre. Red chilli and Sichuan peppercorns deliver the kick, while Indian curry notes keep you guessing.”• 3-16-5 Nishi-Kasai, Edogawa-ku, +81 3 6848 1346, Thur-Tues 11.30am-9.30pm, manriki.netWhen Menson Rage stepped on to the scene in 2015, its chefs took classic ramen conventions and tossed them out of the window. The result is a hip, laid-back space serving revelatory bowls of noodles. Squeeze past the parked bikes and skateboards into a modern restaurant where the shop’s master, a “friendly young dude named Hirota-san, prepares incredibly refined shoyu ramen made using a type of fighting cock originally from Thailand”, Brzeski says.• 3 Chome-37-22 Shoan, Suginami, Mon, Wed-Sat 11am-3pm, 6pm-9pm, Sun 11am-4pmThese noodles get a savoury kick from an unconventional source. “Once you’ve eaten about half your bowl, grab one of the bottles of olive oil sitting on the counter and add a generous splash,” Plaut says. It might sound strange, but it works. “The virgin oil harmonises surprisingly well with the house speciality soup, made from chicken with niboshi and hamaguri clams, while altering the flavour profile of the dish.”• 6-12-12 Ginza, Chuo-ku, +81 3-3571-2123, Mon-Fri 11.30am-10pm, Sat 11.30am-9pmWord spread fast about this slick arrival that debuted at the end of 2018. Ramen is available, but the speciality here is the dipping variety, tsukemen, which comes with a lovely soup made with skipjack tuna, kombu (seaweed) and chicken for dipping. After you’ve slurped up your house-made noodles, pour a little extra dashi into the rich stock to dilute it, then drink it down to the last drop.• 3-10-16 Amanuma, Suginami-ku, Mon-Fri 11.30am-3pm, Sat-Sun 11.30am-4pm“Originally, Teppanyaki Kishin wasn’t even a ramen shop, but a traditional iron-griddle joint. However, several months after it opened in 2016, it started offering a special ramen menu at lunchtime – and the idea is genius,” Plaut says.

It would offer us, it promised, “unique access inside its secretive Willy Wonka world” – a tenuous relationship with standard grammar and immediate recourse to the laziest of cliches being the twin poles around which such creations are traditionally strung.I was all up for it. The video doing the rounds on social media recently of a Wall’s Viennetta being made can only soothe for so long. I was looking forward to an even sweeter treat, something akin to an extended version of the Sesame Street segments that used to show products rolling through factory assembly lines. Because only sights of mass production can ever fill that howling, panicked void inside us all that craves order, uniformity and abundance. I wanted to feel again those few, fleeting moments of peace that they induce. You know?Alas, it was not to be. What we got was an hour of boredom that also functioned – and the programme itself may not be entirely to blame – as the trigger for a very long, dark night of the soul indeed.But – boredom first. This was achieved by various means. Foremost among them was that there was not enough footage of chocolate being made, bar (if you will) a few minutes when we saw fondant-filled chocolate half-shells having their yolks added – one side only, as any fule kno – before the pairs of moulds were slammed together to form a batch of God’s (or at least the Society of Friends’) greatest gift to us, the Creme Egg. It won’t do.Second, there was the assemblage of – with a few honourable exceptions – the dreariest selection of talking heads ever pushed before a camera. They had titles such as “Chocolate devotee” and “Creme Egg superfan” and assured us that they really, really liked the combination of fat, sugar and cacao that humanity has been progressively fattening and sugaring since the Mayans started experimenting with the bitter seeds of the local trees and thought: “Hey, we could be on to something. Let’s tell the rest of Mesoamerica!”Fourth, the programme studiously ignored all avenues of wider interest. Nothing about the golden age of chocolate invention, when the Quaker families – the Frys and the Rowntrees and the Cadburys – turned to the non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated stuff as the best way of going into business without compromising their religious beliefs and spurred each other on to ever more delicious heights. It touched on the Bournville Village, still extant, but you longed for more on the days when employers built whole villages for their workers and considered them something more than assets to be worn down and replaced as necessary. That might have been almost as heartening as a Creme Egg. Unless they were like mill owners who also owned the shops and pubs and so reclaimed the wages in another guise? I don’t want to know that. Maybe it was best left.As for the long, dark night of the soul – well, I can only say that my prelapsarian Sesame Street days are over. It proved impossible to watch the astonishing physical and mental resources going into the making of a new product, the designing of its packaging, the White Creme Egg campaign to stoke sales, the piles of waste accumulating on the factory floor in the wake of a system glitch (it wasn’t even Fruit \u0026amp Nut, which is fit only for the pigbin at the best of times) and not wonder anew if western capitalism isn’t overdue a reckoning. But maybe we’re in the middle of one? By 4am, I was wondering if the Quakers had caused Brexit and if Maltesers could win a second referendum. Why is nothing, absolutely nothing, simple any more?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37717bb8722244ae5fa4013fead4324f96b2f7ce/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ca9bf90f95d212c26ac524cf12318e7","title":"100 best tv shows of the 21st century","story":"Where’s Mad Men?

And bits of sick.” The dictionary definition of cult viewing, Matthew Holness’s spoof of shonky British horror barely made a dent when it aired, but has since become regarded as a modern classic.Mike Judge’s genius comedy about the travails of a motley gang of developers mercilessly sends up the world of tech bros … and yet everyone from Mark Zuckerberg to Google founder Sergey Brin are superfans.The longest day of Jack Bauer’s life became the most gripping TV drama of the 00s, as the hard-nosed CTU agent tried to stop terrorists, turncoat colleagues and even the odd treacherous president in thrilling real-time.The shamelessly soapy and explicit LGBT drama about Bette, Shane and their impossibly glam leather-vest-clad gang in Los Angeles.The first and finest of a wave of modern small-screen westerns, this elegant Elmore Leonard adaptation was stocked full of memorable characters and dizzying dialogue.Daring and dumbfounding, Damon Lindelof’s drama about survivors of a rapture-like event threw everything into its three acclaimed seasons, from homicidal cults to a mass orgy on a boat.About as accurate a depiction of the debauchery, alienation and awkwardness of student life as it’s possible to imagine, this winning comedy-drama introduced us to one of the century’s true style icons in the form of the sensational Vod.Why would anyone watch someone else watching telly? The answer soon became clear with this brilliantly executed reality show, which introduced viewers to a host of hilarious, not to mention surprisingly TV-literate, families.Andrew Haigh’s cruise through the San Francisco gay scene skipped the LGBT lesson-learning in favour of a thrillingly human relationship drama.A ropey B-movie was reimagined as a brilliant subversion of fantasy tropes in Joss Whedon’s beloved series, which introduced the world to a feminist pop icon in Sarah Michelle Gellar’s teen slayer.The celebrity ballroom dance competition that quickstepped on to our screens in 2004 and has made our lives more fab-u-lous by the year.

As Thorpe would say, “a very heaven”.Inarguably the most gleefully offensive show on this list, the sitcom about the despicable owners of a Philly e bar is also one of the most consistent: each of its 13 seasons features a truckload of laugh-out-loud moments.The show that launched a thousand cries of “ooh friends” remains one of the most enjoyable sitcoms of the past decade, with its relatable tale of four suburban normies negotiating sixth form.Frequently compared to The Wire, this French crime saga offered a forensic view of France’s justice system, albeit with enough twists and turns to keep fans totally hooked.Groundbreaking doesn’t even begin to describe this globe-straddling documentary epic, which for the first time showed the world’s wildlife in gleaming HD. A decade later, with death-defying iguanas, its sequel wowed us all over again.From the murderous black smoke to the button that had to be pushed every 108 minutes to save the world, this was the bonkers plane-crash drama that got us all going in the 00s.All hail Frank Gallagher and his magnificent Mancunian ne’er-do-wells! Paul Abbott’s drama might have dragged on a little too long but at its best it provided a refreshing burst of authentically working-class TV comedy-drama.Another heavenly sitcom from Mike Schur (The US Office, Parks and Recreation), this series about a miscreant mistakenly sent to a paradisiacal afterlife managed to combine philosophical questions, jaw-dropping twists and a deluge of gags.Steven Spielberg’s supersized second world war epic expanded the horizons – and budgets – of prestige TV.Proof that Scandinavian drama doesn’t have to be about glowering detectives, this Danish political saga followed glowering politicians instead. Still, it was never less than engrossing and boasted a fascinating figure in glass ceiling-battering prime minister Birgitte Nyborg.Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton’s anthology series continues to amaze, each episode delivering a dizzyingly inventive horror-comedy one-off. Everyone has their favourite, but the Sheridan Smith-starring 12 Days of Christine might just be the show’s masterpiece.A true TV original, Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement’s musical comedy about a hopeless New Zealand band floundering in NYC combined stoner comedy and inescapably earwormy songs to utterly charming effect.Alan Ball’s profound drama about the Fisher family and their funeral home was gloriously moving and unnerving, and made us tackle our own mortality head-on.David Simon was on typically masterful form in this epic about the housing crisis in 80s Yonkers that was tragically underwatched.The newest show on our list, Jesse Armstrong’s comedy-drama about a dysfunctional media dynasty already feels like a modern classic, full of magnificently malignant characters and devastating one-liners.Far better than the glossy film adaptation that followed it, Paul Abbott’s taut, twisty corruption drama felt like the perfect political thriller for the New Labour age. And no, we didn’t just like it because the heroes were journos!The Baker Street reboot that made us all step inside Benedict Cumberbatch’s mind palace. At its best, few shows could match it in terms of pure event television.Mark Rylance cemented his status as one of the greatest living actors with this performance as Thomas Cromwell in a sumptuous prestige TV take on Hilary Mantel’s historical doorstop.Jenji Kohan revolutionised television for ever with her gripping women’s prison drama about Piper, Poussey, Taystee and the Litchfield Penitentiary inmates.“I’m dating a guy with the funkiest tasting spunk.” Faced so recently with the movie SATC2: Calamity in Abu Dhabi, it can be easy to forget just how hilarious and refreshingly candid Samantha, Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte were when they first graced our screens.The best of the glut of prestige true-crime programmes that have emerged in recent years, this forensic docuseries about Robert Durst, the estate heir accused of murder, featured one of the most jaw-dropping final moments of TV ever.Six years on, we’re still wincing at the thought of that eyeball scene, but Dennis Kelly’s conspiracy thriller about an apocalypse-predicting graphic novel was more than just ultraviolence: gorgeously shot and endlessly beguiling, it remains like nothing else on TV.Twenty minutes a week of pure optimism, this Amy Poehler-starring sitcom about a fizzingly enthusiastic civil servant somehow did the miraculous: it made local government seem fun.No contest in the award for the most misanthropic character of the century: Dylan Moran wins hands down for his bile-flecked bookshop owner Bernard Black in this delightfully silly sitcom.Like its predecessor The Good Wife but dialled up to 11, this is the most daring legal drama of them all – with gobsmacking plots about #MeToo monsters, Donald’s pee-pee tape and Melania’s bid to get a stealthy orce.An extraordinary self-flagellating performance by Benedict Cumberbatch as a drug-dependent aristocrat anchored this superb adaptation of Edward St Aubyn’s semi-autobiographical novels. Surely the finest portrayal of addiction ever seen on TV.This was TV drama as comfort blanket: at a time of austerity, Julian Fellowes’s country house epic offered elegantly realised solace in the homilies of the past. If the plotting felt formulaic, the performances were entirely convincing – from Maggie Smith’s dowager countess Violet Crawley to Jim Carter’s impossibly decorous butler Carson, everyone knew their place. PH Read the review.Issa Rae started her acting career with a web series called The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl. While popular, Rae was able to have her seat at the table for real with Insecure. A show about black female friendship and relationships that isn’t filtered through a white gaze and doesn’t play into tired stereotypes, this HBO series refuses to compromise on authenticity, and, despite changing viewing habits, has proved one of the biggest web-to-screen hits to date. HJD Read the review.The Breaking Bad prequel, centred on a ducking, ing lawyer called Jimmy McGill who will one day become Saul Goodman, is an entirely different drama – albeit exploring the same theme of what actions people are willing to take when their American dreams refuse to come true. A supremely measured character piece that has steadily improved as its central tragedy has materialised. JS Read the review.In 2005, Charlie Brooker and Chris Morris’s twatcom seemed oddly dated – a satire of a cultural moment that had already passed. But time has rendered it deeply prescient: Barley occupied a perfectly sealed echo chamber of self-conscious idiocy, and he self-branded furiously, long before social media came for our souls. Before there were hipsters, Nathan and his fellow self-facilitating media nodes were already keeping it Mencap. PH Read the review.The revitalised Doctor Who occupies its rightful position in the TV firmament: rarely the best show in any week or year but always there, always changing, always offering fodder for analysis, arguments and lists. Jodie Whittaker’s arrival as the first female Tardis-jockey maintained the show’s record of refreshing itself just when its relevance threatens to wane – and with so much goodwill behind it, its standout episodes are still a celebratory shared experience. JS Read the review.None more noir but containing flashes of unexpected humour, this was one of the more impressive of the bleak dramas that flooded out of Scandinavia. The bridge of the title was the Øresund, which connected Sweden and Denmark and led to multinational cooperation on a murder enquiry. Step forward ill-matched cops Martin Rohde and more interestingly Saga Norén, a brilliant but bizarre investigator unlike any maverick TV detective ever seen. PH Read the review.Filigree telly, with every painstakingly staged scene a plush indulgence – but Netflix’s more-or-less true story of the British royal family has enough grit to make it more than just a luxury. Claire Foy’s steely Elizabeth II introduced a fine study of people unsure how to live lives made extraordinary by huge privilege and indistinct power. JS Read the review.Terminally overlooked in favour of flashier, flimsier fare, Joe Weisberg’s tale of suburban subterfuge rewarded the few who did tune in with six seasons of gorgeous, slow-burning drama. Real-life husband and wife Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell convinced as a pair of Russian spies playing house in picket-fence 80s America, struggling with notions of loyalty, fidelity and family. The show’s finale, which shifts between toe-curling tension and devastating poignancy, should be regarded as one for the ages. GM Read more here.A starburst of fantastically inventive offence, Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s crude animation combined grotesque hilarity with a deceptively serious purpose. South Park was both a gleeful dismantling of the American dream and a laser-guided exploration of the tender spots where freedom of speech and liberal sensitivities collide. As such, it has proved surprisingly prescient many of America’s current cultural fault lines first became apparent here. PH Read the review.A tender, truthful look at the beating heart of small-town America, shone through the prism of one of its most engrained institutions: high school football. It had us all rooting for the Dillon Panthers, for Coach Taylor and Tami Taylor, quarterback Matt Saracen, cocky running back Smash Williams, badboy fullback Tim Riggins, endlessly lovable nerd Landry Clarke and Tyra Collette, the town’s only anti-football fanatic. We followed them for every triumph and every touchdown, all the while screaming at our screens: “Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose.” KAArriving in 2004, when US president George W Bush was becoming almost as much of a concern as Al-Qaida leader Osama Bin Laden, Adam Curtis’s startling documentary series explored the shockingly congruent aims of fundamentalist Islam and American neo-conservatism. Equally striking was Curtis’s trademark style, all logical provocations and uncanny juxtapositions it’s historical documentary as polemical art installation. PH Read more here.The audacious legal drama took on a ripped-from-the-headlines case every week, tackling everything from fake news to election tampering, police racism and the terrors of surveillance culture. It responded so staggeringly fast to events that it sometimes felt too real. But it was also a rare drama that focused on women – rounded, complex, great, flawed, wonderful women – from the eponymous Alicia Florrick, who moved so far beyond the pained good wife of the opening episode, standing by her man through a humiliating sex scandal, to Diane Lockhart, the barnstorming firebrand in fabulous jewellery (one of the most glorious characters of the century). An exciting, exhilarating slap in the face to the very end. KA Read the review.What initially appeared to be a charming muse on the lives of two eccentric metal-detecting hobbyists soon revealed itself to be something more profound. Mackenzie Crook’s labour of love was very funny, but it became ever more moving and thought-provoking. It was underpinned by a deep but open-minded and inclusive respect for our collective past, and animated by one of the most sweetly convincing friendships in television history. PH Read the review.Even viewers familiar with Chris Morris’s original 1997 current affairs satire raised a few startled eyebrows at Brass Eye’s one-off return in 2001. Morris plunged into what, at the time, was one of the most emotive issues in British life – press coverage of paedophiles – and steamrollered every taboo he could get his teeth into inside half an hour. Newspapers howled, commentators pontificated, politicians blustered – and perhaps that was the point. PH Read more here.With reality TV shifting from catty to comforting in recent times, both the BBC and Channel 4 have enjoyed the sweet smell of success with Bake Off. Mel and Sue’s exodus was a blow to its softly-softly charm and Prue Leith is a more straight-talking judge than Mary Berry. But 10 series in, the amateur baking contest is still an autumn staple. As with most long-running reality shows, there’s still a sense of familiarity despite some changes this year’s series features its youngest ever set of contestants. HJD Read the review.The characters introduced in Shane Meadows’s 2007 film of the same name have acquired a vibrant small-screen life of their own. No wonder: they’re incredibly resonant – they depict the kinds of British lives that are rarely explored at all, let alone with such tenderness and wisdom. We’ve taken This is England’s characters to our hearts but the series also functions as a parallel history of our country, warts and all. PH Read the review.Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan made their comedy great by never playing safe. At first it was a filthy gutbuster about a careless sexfest then it frankly faced the grim reality of parenthood without losing its dirty grin. Finally, killing their darling just before it could flag, the pair delivered one of the best TV endings ever. A hardcore sitcom classic. JS Read the review.The recent 10th anniversary of Jade Goody’s death sparked much conversation around the original lock-em-up-and-throw-away-the-key-for-a-bit reality show. Big Brother was in many ways one of the most heinous shows ever broadcast, from “Nasty Nick” Bateman fleeing the country to escape the tabloids to Kinga’s wine bottle and Shilpa-gate. But it was also a show that would change TV – and our concept of celebrity – for ever. HJD Read more here.Cross-continent reboots are notoriously rubbish. But when they evolve beyond by-the-numbers remakes and find an identity of their own, they can become excellent. A case in point: The Office US (originally subtitled “An American Workplace”) found its feet once it stopped trying to be Gervais Part Two and instead established its own perpetually bored protagonists, led by Michael Scott, Steve Carell’s self-proclaimed “world’s best boss”. HJD Read the review.It would be easy to take David Attenborough’s startling odysseys into the natural world for granted. But technological developments have only increased their wonder, while the exponential destruction of the environment has lent them a polemical edge. Attenborough’s two Blue Planet series have presented more mindblowing, naturally occurring psychedelia – long, strange trips into beautiful but inhospitable realms previously unexplored (and all-too-often degraded) by humanity. PH Read the review.Few shows in TV history have scythed on to the screen with as much elan as Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s spy v spy thriller, which arrived with dialogue as impossibly sharp and cool as the European locations and Jodie Comer’s couture costumes. The death dance between Comer’s psychopath and Sandra Oh’s coiled-spring MI5 nerd means each episode has a handful of outlandish payoffs that other dramas spend whole seasons working towards. JS Read the review.It might have ended back in 2001 but Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright and Jessica Hynes’s flatshare sitcom can stake a legitimate claim as the most influential comedy of this millennium: its quick cuts, genre parodies and geek humour have been adopted by everything from Community to Preacher. Yet for all the Star Wars homages, Spaced was, at its heart, a terrific character comedy, boasting a cracking cast that included Mark Heap’s tortured artist Brian and Julia Deakin’s formidable, chianti-powered landlady Marsha. GM Read the review.Tracking a single murder case across 20 hours of subtitled drama might have seemed a hard sell. But this Danish procedural had a secret weapon in detective Sarah Lund (Sofie Gråbøl). Lund’s knitwear became an unlikely totem of the show, but the real appeal was Gråbøl’s remarkable performance. Over three gripping seasons, Lund told us everything and nothing about herself, becoming one of the great TV enigmas. PH Read the review.Amazon has struggled to get its TV originals right, but it made a perfect start with this mercurial, millennial dramedy. The plaudits for breaking new ground by centring on a transgender character were deserved, and no TV show before or since has handled ersity of gender and sexuality so assuredly. On top of all that is a seriously funny look at people failing to turn fluid modern adulthood into happiness. JS Read the review.Set in the Ripper-plagued Yorkshire of the 1970s, David Peace’s original novels are strewn with feverish internal monologues. Adapting them for television was always likely to prove tricky. However, this trilogy rose to the challenge superbly, drawing on the erse but complementary visions of three different directors (Julian Jarrold, James Marsh and Anand Tucker) and a host of superb performances to bring the era unnervingly to life. PH Read the review.Arriving on our screens with almost eerie timeliness three months into the Trump presidency, this adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel serves as a helpful reminder that, if we’re not careful, things could get even more like Gilead. The show’s patriarchal hellscape, where the chaste culture of kept women sits uneasily next to the machine guns and combat gear of the men doing the keeping, is terrifyingly well-realised, while Elisabeth Moss delivers a remarkable performance as Offred, the Handmaid who dreams of blowing it up. GM Read the review.Wise-ass but frequently just plain wise, Jon Stewart was a broadcasting natural with such range that he was equally convincing whether presenting a show in the aftermath of 911 or excoriating Chicago’s fondness for deep-pan pizza. For more than a decade, he was a unique and persuasive liberal voice in American affairs we shudder to imagine what he would have made of the current US political situation. PH Read more here.Ambition is probably Charlie Brooker’s best quality as a writer: he had the balls to start his sci-fi anthology with an episode about the prime minister being forced to violate a pig, then took the chance to take Black Mirror global by shifting from Channel 4 to Netflix. Now every new helping of his dystopia is event telly, drawing in A-list talent and, with one-offs such as the interactive Bandersnatch, continuing to push at the medium’s limits. JS Read the review.No one knew what to expect from the reappearance, after nearly 30 years, of David Lynch’s mystery drama. From its first frame to its soul-rending primal scream of a conclusion, The Return proved thrillingly baffling, full of indelible images (nuclear explosions, demonic cockroaches, David Bowie as a giant kettle) and dizzying dream logic. At the centre of the chaos was Kyle MacLachlan, radiating previously untapped levels of magnificence as both the valiant Agent Cooper and his breathtakingly evil doppelganger. GM Read the review.The underwhelming Netflix reboot of Mitch Hurwitz’s comedy, about a dysfunctional and in retrospect vaguely Trumpian dynasty, shouldn’t detract too much from the legacy of its brilliant first three seasons, which raised the bar for intricate, intelligent sitcommery. Such was the density of references, callbacks and gags that Arrested Development proved to be that rare thing – a show that became funnier on repeated viewings. GM Read more here.It was the story of a US footballer, accused of murder and subsequently acquitted. But it was so much more besides. Over seven compelling hours, Ezra Edelman pulled back from his immediate subject by homing in on its minutiae. Exploring the context of OJ Simpson’s rise and fall, Edelman constructed a startling treatise on race, gender, celebrity and capitalism itself. The result was an alternative history of modern America. PH Read the review.More like a definitive historical document than a TV series. While Vietnam remains a scab at which America is compelled to pick, Burns’s panorama feels like the last word. Beginning decades before the war and following its echoes up to the present day, the series plunged into the quagmire, illuminating the horror for all to see but concluded with threads of humanity reclaimed from the carnage. PH Read the review.For all its problems (and there were many, from a lack of ersity to Lena Dunham’s impressive propensity for foot-in-mouth moments), Girls changed the half-hour sitcom for the better. Originally billed as an updated Sex and the City, it grew into something more troubled and more troubling, bringing the best of mumblecore to the small screen via a spaghetti-slurping, often half-naked antihero (Dunham’s Hannah Horvath), who proved as relatable as she was entirely out of control. HJD Read more here.David Milch’s unique, picaresque western earned its spurs in the early stages of the HBO TV gold-rush. But it was more singular and ornery than any of its contemporaries. Milch created a universe that was simultaneously recognisable and utterly alien – then peopled it with extraordinary characters such as Ian McShane’s Al Swearengen. Sacred, profane and well deserving of its glorious feature-length resolution this year. PH Read more here.Julia Davis’s Jill Tyrell is the most grotesque comedy creation in living memory. Jill responded to her husband’s cancer diagnosis by attempting to break up the marriage next door, then staging an exceptionally excruciating mock funeral for her spouse (who had recovered but been forcibly committed to a hospice) and trying to seduce a 12-year-old. An absolute monster and an absolute masterpiece of provocation and bad taste. PH Read the review.Aaron Sorkin’s sparky, witty and (some would say excessively) erudite political drama achieved the impossible: it made niche US legislation, from lame-duck sessions to filibusters, utterly compelling. Plus it gave us the most popular president in US history, Josiah “Jed” Bartlet. Fans must watch it now and weep into their fake newspaper at the Trumpian state of things. There were certain missteps (the patronising 911 episode, we’re looking at you), but this was TV that showed America it is possible to hope for better, even the best, from the leader of the free world. KA Read more here.Was Larry David ever wrong? Frequently. But you could usually just about sympathise with his wrongness and understand his arrival in a variety of hideous scrapes. In a sitcom that was both deeply meta (David was playing a constructed but also deconstructed version of himself) and proudly traditional (it overflowed with sight-gags and classic setups), the comedy of excruciation reached its peak. PH Read the review.Rarely has a drama demanding such commitment from viewers captured the popular imagination to this extent. It’s testimony to the excellence of Jed Mercurio’s writing but mainly to masterful central performances from Martin Compston, Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar who, as anti-corruption unit AC12, represent a still point around which all manner of police malfeasance swirls. Line of Duty’s interrogation scenes have set a new standard in small-screen tension and release. PH Read more here.Still badly underrated, Tina Fey’s sitcom rendering of her experiences inside the US TV machine was a fiery take on the tension between creative types and money men, the latter embodied by an all-timer performance from Alec Baldwin as an insane network exec. But it was as cynical about comedians as it was suits, the result being a joke machine with few limits on its satire or its silliness. JS Read more here.A corrective to the cliche-ridden and frequently blokey police procedurals that dominated the first two decades of this century, Sally Wainwright’s slice of Yorkshire noir pulsated with poignant realness. In Sarah Lancashire’s stoic sergeant Catherine Cawood, it found a true heroine for our times, resourceful, funny and empathetic. A good thing too, because the world Wainwright constructed around her – full of death, addiction and desperate poverty – was almost overwhelmingly, authentically bleak. GM Read the review.Donald Glover’s foray into dramedy fizzes with pop-culture callbacks, political subtext and dark lols, following underachieving Earn, wannabe rapper cousin Paper Boi and their black millennial peers. Its best episodes are the ones where racial conflict meets all-out weirdness, among them Helen – in which Earn feels thoroughly adrift at a Germanic festival – and Teddy Perkins, the Shining-inspired, Get Out-style tale of Darius’s (Lakeith Stanfield) trip to pick up a piano from a mysterious hermit. HJD Read more here.The king of 00s sitcoms: formally innovative, with its point-of-view filming and audible inner monologues, and unflinching in how it used that format to be disgustingly honest about diseased male minds. A textbook contrasting duo in careless Jez and cowardly Mark gave writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain the platform for greatness, and the quality barely dipped across nine seasons. Peep Show was always, hilariously, an inch over the boundary of good taste. JS Read more here.When Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag arrived on stage in London some six years ago, critics had their doubts (one even commented “I doubt if this material will spin off into a long-running radio or television series”). How wrong they were: as well as returning to the stage for a sold-out run this year, Fleabag’s two-series TV run saw Waller-Bridge infuse the nascent sadcom genre with classic British awkwardness, encompassing grief, family breakdown and, of course, Obama-themed masturbation. HJD Read more here.Despite the widespread calls by superfans to rewrite the entire last series, from Daenerys’ descent into madness to Starbucksgate, Game of Thrones remains the biggest show of the century so far. Even Ed Sheeran sitting by a fire singing a ditty about hands of gold can’t irreparably dent its reputation. And it did come up with the goods throughout its eight-year reign: from the thrills and blood spills to the men baked in pies and the best battles ever seen on the small screen, right through to Cleganebowl. Only The Winds of Winter book will spare us all from Westeros withdrawal. KA Read more here.It didn’t invent the mockumentary, but Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s debut was so stylistically confident it defined swathes of the comedy that followed its 2001 premiere: two decades on, people are still making pale imitations. Its creators haven’t topped it either but with time, their casting decisions look as extraordinary as their scripts. It’s hard to fathom now that Martin Freeman, Mackenzie Crook and Gervais himself were all then relative unknowns. JS Read more here.The show that arguably killed off the antihero drama: nothing since has been able to top the depraved descent made by Walter White (a never-better Bryan Cranston), from milquetoast chemistry teacher to meth overlord, and few have dared to try. Yet as grimly engrossing as White’s transformation was, what kept us returning to Vince Gilligan’s low-key epic was Aaron Paul’s performance as his reluctant partner in crime, Jesse Pinkman, whose frayed humanity shone through the moral murk like a beacon. GM Read more here.The craven, idiotic likes of Peter Mannion and Nicola Murray would be paragons of probity and wisdom in today’s parliamentary landscape. But at the time, Armando Iannucci’s scabrous comedy felt like an indictment of everything wrong with the spin and cynicism of British politics. Luckily, it was also hilarious, mainly thanks to the inventive invective of Peter Capaldi’s ferocious “Iago with a BlackBerry” Malcolm Tucker. PH Read more here.The sex! The swagger! The suits! Matthew Weiner’s Madison Avenue masterwork went down with all the smooth, smoky allure of one of Don Draper’s copious Old-Fashioneds. But by ning the entire 60s, showing the mammoth social shifts in an ad agency in minute detail – from the advent of the Pill and second-wave feminism to the rise of hippies and the dropping of LSD – it became more than just the tale of one mystery man and compulsive philanderer come good: it was a meditation on how modern America came to be made, one iconic advert at a time. KAAlong with The Sopranos, David Simon and Ed Burns’s Baltimore crime saga showed that small-screen entertainment could be anything it aspired to be: polemical, panoramic, funny, tragic or all of those things at once. Beautifully written and performed, this was both TV as high art and TV wrenched from the soul. To this day, it’s an exemplar of a certain brand of intelligent, ambitious and uncompromising television. PH Read more here.It is hard to fathom now, but when Tony Soprano first slumped into an armchair in his psychiatrist Dr Melfi’s office, TV was still largely looked down upon. The slogan for the Sopranos’ broadcaster – ‘It’s not TV, it’s HBO’ – felt telling in its dismissiveness, as if making a television programme was something to be ashamed about. The Sopranos changed all that.When it first aired, some were quick to dismiss it as just another mob drama. But David Chase took a cleaver to the conventions and cliches of the gangster epic. Its Family wasn’t some pinstripe-clad crew swaggering down Brooklyn back alleys, but a tragicomic rabble reigning over the unprepossessing suburbs of New Jersey. It was a world populated by fragile and petty people, arguing over Tupperware like Paulie Walnuts or ordering a hit over rumours about their bedroom activities like Uncle Junior. And its protagonist was a hulking, ferocious don beset by panic attacks and cowed by his far more ferocious mother.And what a protagonist! Here was a man who would break off from his daughter’s college open day to brutally murder an informant, and we were supposed to if not actively root for him, at least follow him into the abyss. Yet follow him we did, because of the qualities that moved him beyond the mobster stereotype. From the off, this was a show with bigger thoughts in mind: the downfall of the white working class, Jungian psychoanalysis, shifting sexual politics and the eternal question of whether an interior decorator could kill 16 Czechoslovakians. And it played with form with the eagerness of Tony tucking into some ‘gabagool’, staging Godot-like one-acters in the Pine Barrens and devoting entire episodes to the fever-dream musings of a comatose Tony.The Sopranos hastened TV’s transformation into a medium where intelligence, experimentation and depth were treasured. Critics still put it at the top of best of lists like this one. Fevered conversations are still had online about the show’s symbolic use of eggs, ducks and teeth, and of course that rug-pull of an ending. For anyone currently making TV, the show stands as something to aspire to, perhaps even better. That is easier said than done, of course. Plenty of programmes have come at the boss, but none has managed to carry out a successful hit.

The move would likely leave its Palestinian inhabitants completely encircled and largely trapped in isolated enclaves.He said the expansion of Israel to the east would give the country “strategic depth”.The cabinet also approved Mevo’ot Yericho as an official settlement, giving it a permanent status under Israeli law. It was the first time in nearly two decades that the government had held a meeting in the occupied territories, where more than 2.5 million Palestinians live under military rule among roughly 600,000 Israeli settlers.Netanyahu has said he would declare the annexation after the election and hinted it might have already been approved by Washington, adding that his ally Donald Trump was likely to release his long-touted Middle East peace plan soon after the vote.Naftali Bennett, one of Netanyahu’s former ministers, released on Sunday what he said was a map showing details of the unannounced peace plan, which has been a closely guarded secret.The alleged plan, shared by Bennett on Facebook together with a map, showed the disputed city of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley as part of Israel, while Jewish settlements in the West Bank were connected through a network of roads. Palestine was shown as a disjointed mass in the middle.However, Bennett, a far-right ultranationalist who is running against Netanyahu, released the plan in an effort to show that the prime minister was not doing enough to expand Israeli control over Palestinian land.Bennett, who wants Israel to annex the majority of the West Bank, called the map “hell” for settlers as they would be “islands in an ocean of Palestine”. contacted the US government for comment. Israeli media cited unnamed US officials denying the map was accurate.Israel is due to hold its second election in five months after Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving prime minister, was unable to form a coalition government. Facing political defeat, he forced a repeat election.Final opinion polls released on Friday suggest razor-thin margins between his ruling Likud party and the centrist Blue and White alliance led by the former military chief Benny Gantz. It is possible there will be no clear winner, which could kick off weeks of political deal-making with smaller parties to decide Israel’s next government.Netanyahu has sought to play up his diplomatic acumen and relationships with strongman leaders, especially Trump, to convince voters they need him. Trump said on Saturday that he and Netanyahu had spoken about a possible US-Israeli defence treaty, comments seen as an 11th-hour election gift to the prime minister.As in previous elections, the 69-year-old leader has been accused of overtly racist messaging that demonises the country’s substantial Arab minority.His Likud party has issued unfounded warnings that the election could be stolen through voter fraud in Arab areas, a move slammed as a scaremongering attempt to rally voters who fear their political power. And on Thursday, Facebook temporarily shut down a chatbot on the prime minister’s official page for breaching the company’s hate speech policy after it warned of Arabs who “want to destroy us all”.Israel’s Arab parties are expected to win significant seats after reunifying into a single alliance, similar to 2015 when they became the third-largest force in the Knesset. It is possible they could gather enough seats to block Netanyahu from continuing as prime minister.Polls also show the far-right extremist Jewish Power party, whose members have called for the expulsion of Arabs, could enter parliament. If it does, Netanyahu is expected to bring it into a coalition government."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4018908.1568564923!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"publicly funded universities spent about 1 5m on luxury flights","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTrinity College Dublin spent more then a quarter of a million euro on business class flights last year. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Ireland’s publicly-funded universities spent about €1.5 million last year flying academics around the world on luxury flights, newly-obtained figures show.The biggest spender was University College Dublin (UCD), which paid almost €1 million for business class and premium fares over a year, records released under Freedom of Information reveal.In its disclosure, the university complained about the damage of Government cuts to its funding.Trinity College Dublin, which just days ago called for further investment to bulwark against its tumbling down the world university rankings, spent more then a quarter of a million euro on business class flights last year.Air travel records for UCD show staff booking premium seats at a cost of up to more than €6,000 for a single fare. A business class flight to Kuwait came in at €6,419, a seat to Shanghai cost €5,269 and a luxury fare to Brisbane was €5,155.Two business-class flights to Abidjan, in the Ivory Coast, cost more than €5,000 each.Asked for records showing all non-economy and non-budget flights, UCD released details of more than 400 trips, costing more than €960,000 – the vast majority of them business class, mostly running into thousands of euro each.There were a handful of premium economy fares, which cost up to €2,000. UCD declined to detail the purpose of each flight. The records relate to the financial year, from October 1st , 2017 to September 31st, 2018. Top class fares included to Penang in Malaysia (€4,963), Guangzhou (€4,404) and Shanghai (€4,105) in China, as well as Mumbai (€4,500) and Bangalore (€4,264) in India.San FranciscoThere were business class tickets to San Francisco (€4,887), New York (€4,674), Philadelphia (€4,124) and two to Tampa, Florida, costing €2,040 each.Two flights to Sydney cost €4,193 and €4,020, a fare to Melbourne came in at €4,131, while two trips to the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago came in at €2,058 each. More unusual fares included to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia (€1,152).There were also some luxury flights closer to home: a flight to Paris cost €2,338, while business class flights were also booked to Tel Aviv in Israel (€811) and Bremen in Germany (€655).UCD said all staff travelling business class must obtain prior written approval “thus ensuring there is a solid business case each time”.“It is worth noting that we generally only approve business class flights for staff who are travelling long distances to recruit international students for UCD,” a spokeswoman said. “These students, while adding quality and improving the overall UCD experience for all students, also pay a premium fee which has allowed UCD and the university sector in Ireland partly offset the damage caused by government cuts to our funding during the recession.”The UCD spokeswoman said the amount spent on business class flights “seems large when taken in isolation of other facts but when taken alongside the scale of our operation, it does give us excellent financial value”.TCD declined to detail inidual business class fares for its staff last year which ran to €259,084 in total.‘Teach part-time’Almost €150,000 of these were related to the university’s links to the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), with which it runs joint degrees in physiotherapy, occupational therapy as well as radiography and radiation. “The vast bulk of the flights were for Dublin-based Trinity staff who teach part-time in Asia and help to generate significant financial surpluses for Trinity,” a spokeswoman said. “These fly-in staff teach for intensive teaching periods at the campuses of SIT as well as their normal teaching in Dublin.”It declined to detail more than €47,000 in business fares which it labelled only as “Other”.University College Cork said it spent €96,978 on business class and premium flights last year (including one fare to Singapore costing €6,898), NUI Galway spent €36,700 while DCU spent €32,632 on mostly premium economy as well as business and first class.Maynooth University said it “does not hold records of inidual flights centrally”, adding that there were no more than four business class fares last year among a total air travel bill of almost €550,000.‘Academic activities’Technological University Dublin (formerly Dublin Institute of Technology) paid for one first class flight to Ljubljana in Slovenia for “academic activities” at a cost of €513.University of Limerick said some staff flights are booked through a contracted travel agent while others are booked directly and later claimed in expenses. Full disclosure of its records “would require a significant amount of time”, a spokeswoman said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4018815.1568556287!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"louth td rejects alternatives to brexit backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLouth TD Declan Breathnach, centre, at a protest outside Government Buildings in 2017. Photograph: Cyril ByrneA Border county TD has dismissed a UK think tank’s proposed alternatives to replace the contentious Brexit backstop after attending the group’s “roundtable discussion” in a hotel outside Dundalk.Fianna Fáil TD Declan Breathnach said he attended Prosperity UK’s “alternative arrangements commission” meeting at the Carrickdale Hotel on the Border at the weekend to hear their administrative and technological proposals to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The Louth TD said there was credibility in some of the proposed solutions but the arrangements did not take into account how the Border community worked and issues of trust and economies of scale between north and south.“I went there to listen,” he said. “I had engaged with them in the past. I went there to say to them that some of their ideas are very good but it is in the context of finding a solution within the backstop.”He declined to elaborate on what was said at the two-day conference as it was covered by Chatham House Rule, an informal agreement protecting the source of remarks at a private meeting, but he said he could say that he told them he did not believe their ideas would avoid a hard border and that the backstop was still the best option.Integrity of UKAlternative arrangements to the backstop have been dismissed from the EU and the Irish Government to the UK government’s own alternative arrangements working groups as not providing the same solution the backstop does in terms of avoiding a hard border.The original backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland and the Republic aligned under EU economic rules, has been rejected by Conservative MPs and the Democratic Unionist Party as “anti-democratic” and undermining the integrity of the United Kingdom as it would keep the North tied to EU regulations.Prosperity UK’s commission, which is chaired by Remain-voting MP Greg Hands and pro-Brexit MP Suella Braverman, has suggested various measures including a tiered “trusted trader” scheme that would “cut down paperwork and avoid routine customs checks” at the Border.Mr Hands said the group held their meeting in Dundalk as a “bridge-building exercise” to get feedback on their proposals and to find a potential solution to the Brexit deadlock on the basis that the backstop was not going to pass through the House of Commons.“The backstop is a route to a no-deal Brexit,” he said. “For anybody wanting to get a Brexit deal that works for all sides and all communities, the answer lies in alternative arrangements.”Intertwined economiesThe group also proposes special economic zones and regulatory areas both at the Border – between Derry and Donegal, and Newry and Dundalk – and between Ireland and UK that would cover sanitary and phytosanitary regulations protecting food and animal health but based on an assumption that the UK would stay aligned with the EU on these rules initially.“The only way you can have an economic zone to work is to have an all-island economic zone. You cannot pick and choose because the economies are so intertwined,” said Mr Breathnach.Mr Hands, who voted for Mr May’s proposed UK-wide backstop and withdrawal deal, said Prosperity UK wanted the Border meeting held in private as it would be more helpful and constructive.No Government or Dáil representative from Fine Gael attended the meeting.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

When they first spotted it, they thought they had accidentally looked a star – but further research has shown that the black hole is in fact showing behaviour that astronomers had never expected.“We have never seen anything like this in the 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,” said Andrea\u0026nbspGhez, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and a co-senior author of the research. “It’s usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet.We don’t know what is driving this big feast.”Scientists looked through observations taken since 2003, from observatories in Hawaii and Chile. They noticed that on 13 May, the back hole was lit up twice as bright as had ever been before – and it continued to turn incredibly bright on two other nights this year.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red. These so-called red giants then begin to lose their outer layers of material into space. More than half of such a star\u0027s mass can be shed in this manner, forming a shell of surrounding gas. At the same time, the star\u0027s core shrinks and grows hotter, emitting ultraviolet light that causes the expelled gases to glow. Two galaxies are seen interacting with one another. This pair of galaxies is known as UGC2369 and they are being drawn together by mutual gravitational attraction.

As such, it could be just the beginning in a major change in the activity of the black hole.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase — for example if the spigot has been turned up and the rate of gas falling down the black hole ‘drain’ has increased for an extended period — or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the author of a paper describing the discovery..Scientists will now keep looking at the area and hope that new images can help resolve that question. That could in turn help us understand how black holes grow and the kinds of effects they have on the galaxy and the larger universe.The brightening could have come from the fact that a star was seen going very close to the black hole in summer last year, or that another mysterious object known as G2 had its outer layer ripped off when it passed by in 2014. It might also be the result of big asteroids passing near the black hole, scientists said.The black hole poses no danger to life on Earth. It is 26,000 light years away, and the radiation coming out of it would need to be 10 billion times brighter to have any effect here.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Sandé’s new album, Real Life, is out now on Virgin EMI. She is on tour in the UK from 15 November.Bananarama, Clean Bandit, Pet Shop Boys and Westlife are among the acts to perform at Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park on Sunday 15 September.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Somewhat ironically, it appears under a heading indicating that it will allow the phone to be more precise.Which new iPhone should you buy? 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max comparedThe new Apple-designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness – allowing iPhone 11 Pro to precisely locate other U1-equipped Apple devices, it reads. It\u0027s like adding another sense to iPhone, and it\u0027s going to lead to amazing new capabilities.Apple is already rumoured to be working on small tracking devices that could be added to objects to allow them to be found more easily. The phone could presumably seek out those devices – telling you not only how far away your keys are, for instance, but being able to work out which of your chairs they have fallen into, and where exactly they are.The chip could also presumably help with Apple\u0027s plans for augmented reality features. That requires detailed information about the nearby environment, which the chip could presumably help with.The chip is only found on the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, and not the cheaper iPhone 11.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20.

It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.The deleted scene, below, has caused speculation that the X-Men could join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, following Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox, which has the rights to the franchise.The footage was released shortly after Avengers: Endgame director Joe Russo said Spider-Man leaving the MCU was a tragic mistake.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The tallest of the skeletons uncovered measured at 1.9mThe definition of a species is not so clear cutResearchers settled upon the name “frozen dragon” as a nod to the now icy landscape in which the skeleton was discovered, but in reality it would have thrived in a temperate climate that supported lizards, turtles and small mammals.Professor Habib, a fan of Game of Thrones, admitted he initially suggested calling the species Cryodrakon viserionin reference to one of the show’s dragons, which was reborn in ice, according to National Geographic.Despite its fearsome name, the dinosaur suffered many battle scars during its lifetime, with scarred bones and the tooth of a velociraptor-esque creature lodged in the remains.Scientists believe that because of its muscular shape it was a ground hunter who used flight to burst away from danger or to seize its prey.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This tells us a great deal about the anatomy of these large flyers, how they flew and how they lived.”For decades, scientists wrongly classified the remains as the Quetzalcoatlus species of pterosaur, first found in Texas.When Professor Habib, who was measuring the bones to map how the creatures flew, saw the skeleton four years ago, he began to suspect it was unique.He was able to establish it was an azhdarchid, one of the largest types of pterosaur ever known. But his real breakthrough came while studying the creature’s neck vertebrae.Prof Habib discovered that the arrangement of pneumatophores – the holes through which air sacs entered the bones’ interior – were unlike that of any other known azhdarchid.Asteroid that killed dinosaurs hit with force of 10bn atomic bombsHigher oxygen levels helped dinosaurs to flourish, say scientists‘Forgotten dinosaurs’ returning from edge of extinction in US rivers“The creature is similar to the largest pterosaurs known, yet key characteristics gleaned from the cache of bones show it’s actually part of a new genus and species,” he said.“This particular group of pterosaurs includes the largest flying animals of all time. Their anatomy holds important clues about the limits of animal flight and may be important in the future for biologically inspired mechanical design for flight.”Researchers next hope to establish how the muscles of the ”frozen dragon” might have attached to its bones to gain better insight into how it moved.Prof Habib wishes to further measure the bones to learn more about how it flew – the scientific process that first led him to the species’ discovery.Additional reporting by SWNSShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963. Rotolo described the circumstances to the New York Times in 2008: “He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat.” Yet her memoir, A Freewheelin’ Time, also noted the cover’s significance, how it “influenced the look of album covers precisely because of its casual down-home spontaneity and sensibility”.Led Zeppelin couldn’t have picked a better image to serve as a visual introduction to their fans. It’s an easy tactic – using a photo from a real-life tragedy, in this case the Hinderburg disaster, for shock factor. But it worked, and the cover went on to become one of the most indelible images in rock music.1330 18) Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks – Here’s the Sex Pistols. They’d caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Using the word “bollocks” on the front of their artwork caused instant censorship, and more controversy that would only benefit its performance. Despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts. Today, it is arguably the most recognisable punk album cover in music history.For a limited time, The Roots’ Grammy-nominated album Things Fall Apart was available with five different covers, which reflected each of the world’s “greatest turmoils”. The most enduring was a photograph taken during a Civil Rights Movement-era riot – a stark black and white image showing riot police as they chase two terrified black teenagers.Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, with Storm Thorgerson\u0027s geometric design, is the most iconic of Pink Floyd covers. But the shot he conceived for Wish You Were Here – taken by Aubrey ‘Po’ Powell – is by far the more visceral. It shows two businessmen shaking hands, with one of them on fire, and to the band it represented the fear of revealing your true feelings for fear of “getting burnt”. Two stuntmen were involved, with one (Ronnie Rondell Jr) dressed in a fire-retardant outfit covered by a business suit, and his head protected by a hood, covered beneath a wig. Unfortunately, high winds meant he lost his moustache and eyebrows to the flames. Hopefully he felt the resulting shot was worth it. Fans definitely think so.Just two of Fleetwood Mac’s then-five members appear on the cover of their best-selling and arguably greatest album. Stevie Nicks and Mick Fleetwood’s legs are entwined, which serves as a pretty good metaphor for the entanglement between band members that resulted in so many of the record’s lyrical back-and-forths. And really it’s just a gorgeous, classic image, photographed and conceived by Herbert W Worthington with the band, and designed by Desmond Strobel.The instantly iconic cover of It’s Blitz! shows little but says a lot. There’s a sense of female defiance in showing the woman’s hand, nails in red polish, crushing the egg, a symbol of fertility. It also embodies what the Yeah Yeah Yeahs did on this album, which is take traditional sounds, equipment and ideas and scramble them into something completely subversive.This shot was taken by celebrated photographer Herb Ritts, who later teamed up with Madonna for the “Like a Prayer” and “You Can Dance” covers. It is one of her most recognisable images, inspired in part by Andy Warhol’s pop art and also by the iconography of Madonna’s idol Marilyn Monroe. Here, she invites fans to make the immediate connection between pop art and commercial value, making her the first to exploit the late Eighties concept of pop artist as brand.The Clash paid tribute to Elvis Presley by mimicking the pink and green lettering from his 1956 self-titled album. Yet the image, one of the most iconic in rock history, blows that version of rock and roll to kingdom come: everything “safe” that the King had offered was replaced by Pennie Smith’s photograph of “the ultimate rock’n’roll moment – total loss of control”. Bassist Paul Simonon later told Fender that he’d smashed his guitar out of frustration with bouncers for not letting fans stand up from their seats at the Palladium in New York City. The captured moment is visceral, dangerous and anti-establishment – just like The Clash.Elvis Presley appears mid-belt on the cover of his self-titled album, clearly performing one of those iconic vocal whoops. It’s a visual introduction to rock’n’roll for his unsuspecting American audience, done 20 years before The Clash would replicate that classic pink and green lettering to do the same for their British fans.Six guys stare down toward the ground, one pointing a handgun right at the viewer. This is the cover art for Straight Outta Compton, the pioneering debut by NWA. The photographer was a 28-year-old white guy, Eric Poppleton, who was struggling to make ends meet after graduating from art school. He and his art director Kevin Hosman spent a day following the guys around alleys in LA, until Poppleton found a spot where he got on the ground and asked NWA’s members to stand over him, with one holding “what was hopefully an unloaded” gun. He had no idea the photograph would become one of the most iconic images in gangsta rap. Poppleton would go on to shoot four other NWA album covers.2230 9) Bruce Springsteen – Born in the USAThe Boss tells you everything you need to know about him with one image. An epitome of the blue collar American, Springsteen’s seventh album cover was shot by Annie Leibowitz and shows the artist’s from behind, dressed in worn blue jeans and a simple white t-shirt, with a red cap hanging out of the back pocket after a long day’s grind. “We took a lot of different types of pictures,” said Springsteen, “and in the end, the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face.” Combined with the American flag in the background, the cover parallels the themes of Springsteen’s music.An album cover that would inspire future generations of bands to slouch moodily against brick walls. The Ramones were near-impossible to gather together for a posed photograph, but Robert Bayley – a photographer for Punk magazine, managed to get a shot that captured the band perfectly. Wearing ripped jeans and leather jackets, they stare blankly at the camera through sunglasses, or fringes that half-conceal their eyes.Few album covers can profess to have literally stopped traffic, and it’s testament to the iconic status of Abbey Road’s artwork that thousands of fans have attempted to recreate it. The band, and photographer Iain McMillan, had just 10 minutes to get the shot, which was taken from a step-ladder while a police officer held up traffic behind the scenes. Six photos were taken, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before making his decision.Before he tried to “break the internet” with a nude Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, Jean-Paul Goude took some of the most memorable images of the Eighties for Grace Jones’s album Island Life. She appears on the cover in what looks like an impossible pose it is, in fact, a composite of her in different positions, cut and pasted together for one of the most striking images in music history.2630 5) The Velvet Underground and Nico – The Velvet Underground and NicoLike the working zipper of The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, early versions of The Velvet Underground and Nico asked the owner to “Peel slowly and see”, upon which they’d peel the banana skin to reveal a flesh-coloured banana beneath. MGM was happy to fork out for the additional costs of manufacturing the vinyl, with the assumption that its ties to Warhol would help boost sales. It’s one of very few albums where the person behind the album art, rather than the band themselves or the album title, are named on the cover.The cover art for Joy Division’s debut album was designed by Peter Saville, who had previously created posters for Manchester’s Factor Club in the late Seventies. The chosen image, which was picked by Bernard Sumner, is based on radio waves from pulsar CP 1919 – from the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. “The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes,” Susie Goldring said in a review for BBC Online. “Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn\u0027t draw you in, the music will.With its star-studded cast and bold colour scheme, the cover of Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came to define artist Peter Blake and also The Beatles themselves. There are 88 figures in all, including the band themselves, on a set photographed by Michael Cooper. Blake collected a list of names from three of the four Beatles. The list included Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and even Adolf Hitler (requested by John Lennon, and hidden behind other figures). If you bought the record, Blake later said, “you also bought a piece of art on exactly the level that I was aiming for”.Critic Camille Paglia once suggested that Robert Mapplethorpe’s photo of his former lover, friend and collaborator Patti Smith is the greatest ever taken of a woman, and seeing it, you feel inclined to agree. The godmother of punk herself said she thought she looked like Frank Sinatra, dressed in a crisp white shirt with a black ribbon around her neck. A black jacket with a horse brooch on the lapel is slung casually over her shoulder.  “The only rule we had was, Robert told me if I wore a white shirt, not to wear a dirty one,” Smith told NPR in 2010. “I got my favourite ribbon and my favourite jacket, and he took about 12 pictures. By the eighth one he said, \u0027I got it\u0027.”Photographer Colin Lane met the Strokes in early 2001, after being commissioned to shoot them for The Face magazine. The album cover happened by chance – after hanging out on another shoot a few weeks later, Lane heard the band’s art director hassling them to choose an album cover. He’d brought his portfolio with him, which included the now-infamous “ass shot”.230 29) The Notorious BIG – Ready to DieBiggie Smalls picked a baby resembling himself to star on the cover of his debut Ready to Die. By doing so, he summed up the album’s autobiographical content, which begins with childhood and closes with death. He also uses the notion of childhood innocence to foreshadow how our surroundings can have a lasting impact.It might not be the quintessential David Bowie album, or the one that introduced fans to Starman. But the face staring back at you from this particular album cover is, undeniably, the most recognisable Bowie look: red mullet a gaunt, sombre expression and that famous lightning bolt across his face.One of the greatest debut albums – and arguably the best hip hop record – of all time has a fittingly arresting cover image. A photo of a seven-year-old Nas was superimposed over Danny Clinch’s snapshot of one of the housing projects in the New York rapper’s native Queensbridge. Designed by Aimee Macauley, it was intended to reflect how the projects used to be Nas’s entire world, “until I educated myself to see there’s more out there”. But Nas was also inviting you to see through his eyes and into those very projects where he grew up, and feel immersed in that world via the power of his storytelling.Years after its release, Kate Bush noted how The Dreaming was deemed by many to be her “she’s gone mad” album. Its multiple, disparate narratives and metamorphic production intertwine with movie influences, particularly music hall crime capers of Houdini’s era. On the sepia-toned album cover, Bush plays the role of the escapist’s wife, looking to the distance, rather than at his face, as though trying to contact him via a different medium than mere speech. The way she holds his face in her hands gives her an additional, mesmerising power and conjures the old-world, eccentric mysticism with which she was – and still is – associated.Photographer Michael Spencer Jones had a task on his hands organising Oasis for what is indisputably their best album cover. It was different to what the band originally envisioned – Noel Gallagher had spotted a photo of the Beatles sat round a coffee in Japan, so thought Oasis could be photographed at the dining table of guitarist Bonehead’s house in Manchester. Jones didn’t see this working, so spread the members around Bonehead’s living room instead, and asked them to bring objects that were personal to them for decoration. Noel liked Jones’s idea of hanging an inflatable globe (brought by one of the roadies) from the ceiling. “Yeah, global dominance,” he said. Soon after the album’s release, that’s exactly what happened.Andy Warhol conceived the idea of a vinyl cover with working zipper that would reveal a pair of white briefs beneath the bulging jeans of a male model, who has to this day never been identified. Many fans assumed it was Mick Jagger, but people working on the shoot said several models were photographed and Warhol never revealed which one was used. It represented what the Rolling Stones quickly became famous for: an edgy, hyper-sexual kind of swagger.German painter Mati Klarwein – who also created Santana’s artwork for Abraxas – was behind this gatefold cover that served as an embodiment of Davis’s creative manifesto. The surreal and complex renderings mirror what Davis does with the music itself challenging traditional notions of structure and juxtaposing concepts of passivity and aggressiveness, anger and love.930 22) ACDC – Back in BlackBack in Black’s all-black cover design fit the mood of a band emerging from dark times. In the wake of the death of vocalist Bon Scott, ACDC had tracked down Brian Johnson, whom Scott had previously mentioned to the band. Certain people at their record label, Atlantic, weren’t so keen on the cover, but the band were insistent: it was a memorial to Scott. And now one of the most instantly recognisable and best-loved album covers in rock history.Visually striking and symbolic of what Debbie Harry was doing both as a woman and an artist in the music industry, Parallel Lines’ cover was shot by photographer Edo Bertoglio. It was apparently rejected by the band but later chosen by their manager, Peter Leeds. The juxtaposition between the band, who beam in their matching dress suits like a bunch of schoolboys at their senior prom, and Harry, who stands defiant in her white dress, hands on hips, is wonderful. “I’m not impressed,” her stance seems to say. “Try harder.”Dylan walks arm-in-arm with then-girlfriend and muse Suze Rotolo through the West Village in freezing New York, February 1963.

We haven’t done anything wrong. My father is really ill. I feel so guilty for my mother. I feel so selfish because I can’t go back to see my father. Why does it have to be like this? We feel so helpless.”The couple’s solicitor, Bryony Rest from David Gray Solicitors, said:\u0026nbsp“When the EU settlement scheme was announced by the government in June 2018 it was hailed as a ‘simple and straightforward’ and ‘streamlined and user-friendly’ process.\u0026nbsp“While the government says that no one has been refused to date, the Home Office appears to be delaying decisions on some applications, possibly to avoid refusals.”Non-EU spouses are entitled to travel and reside with their EU national husband or wife in another member state under freedom of movement laws, so are eligible to apply for settlement in the same way as their partners.But as part of the application\u0026nbspthey are often required to submit their biometric information\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspfingerprints and a photograph –\u0026nbspthrough the Home Office’s\u0026nbspoutsourced visa system, run by French firm Sopra Steria,\u0026nbspwhich has been criticised\u0026nbspin recent months for providing an “inconsistent” and “substandard” service.Another Chinese national, who did not want to be named for fears it would put her employment in jeopardy,\u0026nbspwaited\u0026nbspmore than two months for a decision on her EU settlement application due to a “technical error” with her biometrics submission.Less than three hours\u0026nbspafter The Independent contacted the Home Office regarding her case, she was granted settled status.Having previously had no\u0026nbspissues with the Home Office regarding her status since she moved to Britain in 2011, the woman, who has a French partner,\u0026nbspdidn’t expect to have any problems when she applied on 2 July.Due to\u0026nbspa lack of\u0026nbspbiometrics\u0026nbspappointments being offered\u0026nbspon Sopra Steria’s website, she had paid more than £200 to have one\u0026nbspthe following day, rather than wait\u0026nbspfor a free\u0026nbspone\u0026nbspto become available.The delay\u0026nbspmeant she was unable to visit her sick grandmother, who died last month, because her five-year residence – which she planned to replace with EU settlement – expired on 30 July.“It was a bit inhumane for me to have to make that choice between not seeing my grandmother and potentially losing the right to live here. My grandma raised me until I was six, so it was a difficult decision,” she said.“As far as the law’s concerned I’m also an EU citizen, so why can’t I be treated like one? What’s the point in making it easy for EU nationals\u0026nbspbut making it hard for the people they want to stay with them in the UK?“Both my partner and I have had\u0026nbspa lot of stress over this situation. It’s made me feel less welcome here. Even if my application is now complete, I think this whole process has been incredibly unfair and I am sure there are others.”New rules for EU nationals after possible no-deal BrexitWill EU nationals be subject to the hostile environment after Brexit?Tens of thousands of EU nationals face being undocumented after BrexitChristopher Desira, immigration solicitor at Seraphus law firm, said the company\u0026nbsphad seen “loads of cases” where the settlement applications of non-EU spouses were being delayed, some for\u0026nbspas long as five months and counting,\u0026nbspand that many people were subsequently being left in a “state of limbo”.He added: “Of course the Home Office needs to do the right background checks and make sure they’re granting status to the right people on the right basis, but a delay of five months on an application process that’s meant to be simple and straightforward is too long.”He raised concerns that, while the EU settlement statistics may currently suggest the scheme is working well, they “don’t tell us anything about the cases that are outstanding, or the length of delays”.“We don’t know if there are problems building up. It could be the start of a build-up of a backlog of cases, with complex cases taking much longer to decide, and with refusals coming at a particular time when it’s better to issue refusals rather than before Brexit has happened,” Mr Desira\u0026nbspsaid.“We can only go on past performance, and when the Home Office has known that it’s got an influx of applicants coming in, they start off well\u0026nbspbut then backlogs start building.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The EU settlement scheme is a free, straightforward and easy way for EU citizens and their family members to secure the rights they are entitled to, and they have until December 2020 to apply.“The scheme is performing well.\u0026nbspWe are currently processing up to 20,000 applications per day and over 1.1 million people have been granted status already.\u0026nbspOur settlement resolution centre is there to assist any iniduals with concerns about their applications.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Usually we’re scared, we’re having things shouted at us, we’re humiliated and just really embarrassed.“Social interactions aren’t usually that relaxing so today is all about being together in public and keeping each other safe and uplifted. It’s the one day we’re not outcasts.”The march, which ran from Hyde Park Corner to Soho Square, ended with speeches at various LGBT+ venues.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When don’t knows are removed the margin is 73-27.Lord Hain said: “Brexit, especially a hard Brexit, is a green light to Scottish nationalists to push for a referendum, and similarly for Irish republicans.“I’ve always been fearful that Brexit would make the break-up of the UK more likely, and this poll confirms it. We’ve already seen in other surveys that Tory Leave voters want Brexit even if it means Scotland and Northern Ireland leaving the UK.”Nicola Sturgeon has said she intends to table a formal request before Christmas for the power to stage a new referendum, and the issue is set to be a central plank of the SNP’s campaign in the expected snap election.Corbyn backs fresh Scottish independence referendum in coming yearsHow could Scotland secure a second independence referendum?Brexit paves way for Scottish independence, Sturgeon saysRees Mogg says Scotland not due independence referendum for 20 yearsBut Mr Johnson said during a visit to Scotland that he did not see why he should “go back” on the result of the 2014 referendum, which delivered a 55-45 per cent margin in favour of staying in the UK.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Throughout the Brexit process we have been completely ignored. The past three years have underlined the rising and unsustainable cost to Scotland of not being independent.“It is no wonder that support for independence is at record levels. The people of Scotland deserve the choice of a better future than the Brexit Britain being imposed upon us against our will.”The BMG study did not include the views of\u0026nbsppeople in\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, but a recent survey by pollster Lord Ashcroft found the outcome of a border poll would be on a knife-edge, with 45 per cent saying they would vote to stay in the UK and 46 per cent to join the Republic.The DUP’s MP for Belfast East,\u0026nbspGavin Robinson, said, “Northern Ireland’s future is best served inside the United Kingdom for economic, social, cultural and historic reasons.“The criteria for holding a border poll are clearly outlined and have not been met. However, the focus should not be on holding a isive border poll and creating further community tension in Northern Ireland.“We want to see the Northern Ireland assembly and devolved institutions restored so that decisions can be taken on schools, hospitals and the other vital public services which everyone relies on.”BMG questioned 1,504 adults in England, Scotland and Wales between 3 and 6 September.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

I always thought that going forward you would have an economic core which would revolve around Germany – the main economic powerhouse in the eurozone – and then it made sense to have a defence and security core that Britain would lead.”In his speech today, Mr Umunna will say that his own mixed English, Irish and Nigerian heritage is an example of the “liberal, open, internationalist spirit” which Lib Dems cherish.He will say that his new party “exists to build and defend a fair, free and open society” and to fight for the rights of those from all backgrounds to live together in peace.In a swipe at Mr Johnson’s suggestion that he might not obey anti-no-deal legislation and Tory jibes at judges, Mr Umunna will say that Lib Dems demand that governments “respect the rule of law with an independent judiciary ... free from abuse and attack by the executive”.“This is the Britain we know and love, and Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and the other peddlers\u0026nbspof hate and ision had better know that this is what we will fight for at the coming election,” he will say.“It is our job to make sure this country’s heartbeat is liberal and internationalist, not nationalist, populist and authoritarian. It is the new fault line in British politics and we know where we stand.”Mr Umunna will say that, under Mr Corbyn, his old party Labour “is not the party of Attlee and Bevin”.Labour cannot claim to be a “champion of liberalism” so long as it is under investigation over antisemitism and when activists feel able to “abuse, vilify and deselect” critics of the leader, he will say.And he will accuse Mr\u0026nbspCorbyn of being an “apologist” for Russia’s Vladimir Putin and lauding authoritarian regimes in Iran and Venezuela while seeking to abolish Nato.“What unites both Johnson and Corbyn is the fact that both want to leave the EU, this biggest champion of liberalism in our neighbourhood,” he will say.“Neither is fit to lead this country. It’s time for a change and someone I know can provide that leadership – Jo Swinson.”Elsewhere at the Bournemouth conference, Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Sir Ed Davey will commit the party to introducing a “wellbeing budget” to help the most vulnerable in society, as well as a “climate emergency budget” to support the drive to decarbonise capitalism.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

by Labour for the climate deal to the annual conference in Brighton, more than for any other issue – including Brexit.Each constituency party is allowed to send one policy motion or rule change to

The Independent sought comment from Albanian officials and the law firms that represented the country in the arbitration matter, but received no substantive reply by publication. One UK law firm representing Albania said its barristers were “all just too thinly spread with client work” to comment.\u0026nbspOf the tens of millions of euros Albania was ordered to pay, it has so far yet to pay a penny.Becchetti (centre)\u0026nbspappeared at the 2014 launch partyIt was with high hopes that Becchetti and his business partners entered the country as investors in the hydro-electric industry during the 1990s as it emerged from one of the most repressive communist dictatorships in Europe. He\u0026nbspfirst launched the free daily newspaper AgonFree in 2006, applying to open a satellite TV station in 2013. \u0026nbspThe station expanded rapidly, launching 24-hour broadcasts the next year, and starting an Italian-language sister channel in 2015.\u0026nbsp“We were fiercely independent and unafraid of criticising the ruling parties,” says Becchetti, best known in the UK as owner of the football club Leyton Orient for several unhappy years – the club was relegated and racked up over £5m in debts during his tenure.\u0026nbspBecchetti hoped to build on his investment in Albania, using low production costs to launch Italian broadcasts and perhaps eventually English and other language channels.Journalists like Meco who worked at the channel describe it as a haven for professionals. It used up-to-date HD quality broadcast technology. Some 500 employees were housed in an office just outside the centre of Tirana.\u0026nbspThe station employed top-notch editors and producers, paying salaries three or four times what other Albanian journalists were making.\u0026nbspBut troubles between Rama’s government and the station began immediately. In one incident, Erion Veliaj – a Rama ally who is now mayor of Tirana – was upset that Agon covered his fancy September 2014 wedding.\u0026nbspThe battle between the station and the government escalated, perhaps exacerbated by tensions between Albania and Becchetti over his energy sector investments.\u0026nbspAgon reported what it described as widespread allegations of electoral fraud in 2015 municipal elections that saw victories for Rama and his party.Meanwhile, Albanian prosecutors formally charged Becchetti and his partner Mauro De Renzis with forgery, money laundering and tax evasion, and launched legal manoeuvres to take control of Agon.\u0026nbspRama railed against the channel in television interviews, describing it as a “scandalous phenomenon against which we have declared war”, and accusing it of being funded by “dirty money”.Agon continued to broadcast, though its employees couldn’t get paid. Attempts to wire them money from Italy were blocked by Albanian banks. The government upped the pressure: Agon’s journalists, editors, analysts, cameramen and even hair stylists were stopped at Albania’s borders and forbidden to travel abroad.\u0026nbspCourt orders were drawn up to seize the channel, but few believed a government aspiring to join the European Union would take so drastic a move.\u0026nbspAgon TV, which was one of the most technologically advanced news channels in the tiny nation of Albania\u0026nbsp(Agon TV)“I was shocked,” says Meco, now 42 and still working as a journalist in Albania. She still hasn’t gotten over the government-backed seizure of Agon. “I didn’t think things would come to this end.”For three years Meco struggled to find work as a journalist, before eventually landing a job at another channel. But she continues to long for the stature and resources of Agon.\u0026nbsp“It was a channel where as a journalist you could exercise liberty and freedom of information,” she says. “This is very important not only for me, but Albania also had this great opportunity to be represented in the world with such a project. Everything after is like being downgraded. Nothing is like what we had.”The arbitration panel found the accusations of money laundering and tax evasion against Becchetti unfounded.\u0026nbspHe suspects the Albanian campaign against him was rooted in his energy dealings as well as the content of Agon TV, with powerful competitors in Italy and Albania egging on Rama.‘We were fiercely independent and unafraid of criticising the ruling parties,’ says Francesco\u0026nbspBecchetti, who owned\u0026nbspAgon\u0026nbspTV (PA)Western governments have repeatedly refused to honour\u0026nbspInterpol red notices that Albania issued against Becchetti and his partners, and Albania has quietly withdrawn the requests.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRama, asked earlier this year about the case, refused to disclose details about the case or comment on the ruling, citing a confidentiality agreement. The case has cost the impoverished country millions of euros in legal fees.\u0026nbspBecchetti\u0026nbspnow spends much of his time overseeing his various legal battles with Albania, but\u0026nbspis also attempting to\u0026nbspstart\u0026nbspan investment fund for entrepreneurs pursuing international ventures. He says he is also writing a screenplay about his Albania misadventures.The battle for Agon TV has cost him four years of his life, but he says the real loss is what Albania could have become.\u0026nbspSince shutting down Agon, Albania has increased attempts to impose restrictions and pressure on the press. Since last year, it has fallen from 75th to 82nd in the Reporters Sans Frontier ranking of countries’\u0026nbspmedia freedom.Rama is said to repeatedly refer to Albanian journalists as “trash bins” – though he promised a group of international media freedom advocates he met in Tirana in June that he would refrain from continuing to use the smear.\u0026nbspOver the summer, Adi Krasta and Ylli Rakipi – both journalists who are critical of Rama and his protege Veliaj – were fired from talk shows on the Albanian News24 TV channel, under alleged government pressure.\u0026nbsp“After the fall of the communist regime, Albania started to build up its democracy from scratch – and thanks to the hard work of the Albanian people, aided by international investors like myself,\u0026nbspthe country broke through the inertia of its past and had made great strides forward,” says Becchetti.\u0026nbsp“But the Rama government then put in place a series of actions against the freedom of people, including the closure of Agon channel and the attempt to arrest me, which was a huge step backwards.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

CubaResearchers for global animal welfare organisation Four Paws filmed a brown bear made to perform tricks including riding a skateboard and dancing with a hula hoop for cheering crowds at the Czech Republic’s Cirkus Humberto.Other shows featured lions, zebras and elephants, according to the witnesses, who said the conditions and displays were “far from the life the animals would have in the wild” and that their “ecological needs simply cannot be met”.Cirkus Humberto says none of its animals is forced to do anything, that play stimulates their brains and that activist groups who “spread misinformation” whip up xenophobia against circus people.\u0026nbspAt a medieval festival in France, a muzzled bear on a leash performed on a stool and a slide, and wolves had to jump through hoops.“The wolves look emaciated and seem stressed, while the bear appears visibly uncomfortable with the leash and muzzle,” said Kieran Harkin, of Four Paws.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the

None of their ecological needs is considered.”Gekoski)Four Paws\u0026nbspsaid in many cases during the investigation across Europe last month animals were seen kept in small enclosures or cages, causing psychological and physical damage.The group says while Asia’s wildlife tourism industry is widely reported, little is known about the “ruthless” abuse closer to home and the evidence found was “horrendous”.\u0026nbspIs elephant riding in Thailand abuse?At German circuses, visitors rode on elephants’ backs – controversial because behind-the-scenes training often involves hitting the animals with sharp hooks.In circus rings they were made to sit on small chairs, play football and stand on one leg.Researchers say that every year there is a tug-of-war between the elephants and villagers, and in winter the animals have to pull sledges.“Elephants are highly intelligent herd animals who migrate and occupy vast areas of land. It is extremely cruel to keep them enclosed in small spaces and exploit them,” said Mr Harkin.“Lack of movement in captivity can result in joint or back problems, in addition to the indeterminable psychological distress.”Tourists in Spain were put at risk when they played and took selfies with a tiger, the researchers said.“The footage shows how the tiger snaps at a visitor while playing chase – behaviour expected from a tiger but that makes interactions extremely dangerous for humans.“The tiger is a predator weighing about 300kg with sharp teeth and claws. Her natural instincts cannot be suppressed.”The female tiger is among more than 100 other wild animals rented out for film productions and used as tourist photo props.“Tigers are commercially traded and treated as a commodity throughout Europe, and this can overlap with illegal tiger trade,” said Mr Harkin.Elephants poked with pointed sticks for UK tourists at Indian resortAt a French zoo an animal tamer went into a cage alone with up to 10 tigers elsewhere orangutans were kept in small cages.“Ironically a video is played before the show pointing out the importance of conservation of tigers. The commercialisation and exploitation of these animals have nothing to do with the conservation of wild tigers – on the contrary,” he said.\u0026nbspBack in the Czech Republic, at a castle in\u0026nbspCesky Krumlov, investigators also saw three bears kept in a stone moat, denied the chance to climb or roam free.\u0026nbspThe Independent has asked the castle authorities and a\u0026nbspSpanish company\u0026nbspwhere tourists take selfies with tigers\u0026nbspto comment.“It is unacceptable that in the 21st century it’s legal in Europe to abuse wild animals for entertainment,” said Mr\u0026nbspHarkin.“What happens to the animals once they become too old or sick to perform or when the cubs are too old for petting?”Wales may ban ‘cruel practice’ of using wild animals in circusesHynek\u0026nbspNavratil, director of\u0026nbspCirkus\u0026nbspHumberto, said their animals, which were in “perfect condition, better than in zoos”, were regularly checked by vets and were considered family members and colleagues, trained with a rewards system.Stereotypical behaviour\u0026nbspfrom stress\u0026nbspis never seen in Czech circuses, he said. “We play with them, it keeps their brains working.”“Activist groups spread disinformation and stimulate xenophobic behaviour towards people in circuses. Because of that, we are reporting death threats to police, every week,” Mr\u0026nbspNavratil\u0026nbspsaid.But the circus “defeated” the groups by\u0026nbspopening its gates\u0026nbspto the public, including training, so people can see the conditions. “We have nothing to hide,” he went on.“We do not take Four Paws and such organisations as partners to dialogue. They do not not know anything about us, nor they do not know anything about our animals... We cannot respect them.”\u0026nbspIllegal breeding was not possible, he said, adding: “Our animals are not slaves. Sometimes some animal does not want to perform on a certain day. Then it does not.“These animals cannot be considered wild. According to modern genome studies, it has been proven that domestication takes a sudden twist within five generations.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000.

Presumably their own ­unelected pseudo-Government will see to it, since Boris Johnson won’t agree.This pro-EU elite — Letwin, Blair, Mandelson and the rest, in treacherous collusion with Brussels — want to “resolve” Brexit. They mean “reverse” it, with a referendum question splitting the Leave vote and stitched up for Remain.Brexit won’t be “resolved”we back Leave again. They won’t accept that result any more than the last. Their referendum would be utterly illegitimate.To cap it all, ex-Tory Remainers are now plotting for Rory Stewart to stand against Boris in Uxbridge.Remember Amber Rudd and others throwing hissy fits when he kicked these wreckers out  What  did they deserve THE Sun has repeatedly predicted No Deal would cause turbulence. Leavers expect it.Most know it could hit them in the pocket too. But maintaining a fat bank balance and a comfortable existence isn’t the argument-clincher for them that it is for many Remainers.It’s no surprise Remain MPs are gleefully deploying the “Yellowhammer” report to ratchet up the hysteria about Brexit. It won’t impress Leavers.And we would love to read an “impact assessment” into telling a .million majority their votes didn’t count and surrendering our economy to Marxists.No Deal risks short-term disruption.

For a packet of  cigarettes the saving will be as much as £. But Hancock, it appears, will not be celebrating.He has complained that he wasn’t consulted about the Chancellor’s plan to reintroduce duty free on trips from EU countries, and that it will help to undermine the Department of Health’s campaigns to persuade us to smoke and drink less.Obviously, that is good advice. But is anyone really going to take up smoking or go on a drinking binge just because it becomes a little cheaper to buy cigarettes and alcohol at an airport Duty free is a harmless little treat for ing holiday- makers — something to ensure we remain in good cheer for a few weeks after wefrom holiday, or a little in the way of compensationit rained all week on our Spanish beach.Duty free, as anyone over  will remember, used to be a staple part of a foreign holiday. The concept arose because once we have passed through security at a port or airport, we are deemed for tax purposes already to have left the country.Customs and Excise authorities concluded, there- fore, that they had no right to charge us duties designed to capture taxes from domestic consumption.We are theoretically still liable to pay duty on goods when we are entering a country. But in practice most countries will waive duty on small quantities of alcoholic drinks and tobacco products brought in by arriving passengers.As a result, passengers arriving in Britain from non-EU countries are currently allowed to bring back up to four litres of still wine, a litre of spirits,  litres of beer and  cigarettes without paying duty.For passengers arriving in Britain from other EU countries, however, the rules changed in  — seven years after the creation of the single market.Duty free was abolished for people travelling between EU countries. In some ways, the single market was more generous than the previous duty-free regime.Rather than just four litres of wine, for example, we are now allowed to bring unlimited quantities of wine without paying UK duty, so long as it is only for personal consumption.Given that the duty on wine is a lot lower in France than in Britain, we can save a small fortune by stocking up in a French hypermarket.What the EU single market did stop, however, was our ability to travel, say, from France to Britain without paying duty in either country. What Sajid Javid wants to do is to give us the best of both worlds.From October  — assuming we leave the EU without continuing to be subject to the rules of the single market — we will regain our duty-free allowances.But, in addition, we will continue to be allowed to bring unlimited quantities of alcohol and tobacco which we bought in France and which we intend to use only for personal consumption.The main beneficiaries of duty free, needless to say, are smokers and drinkers. But you don’t have to smoke or drink in order to benefit from its existence.The profits from duty free allow airlines and ferry operators to keep their ticket prices down. When the EU proposed to abolish duty free in the s, the travel industry calculated that , jobs in the UK were dependent on its existence.That was no doubt exaggerated for effect, and of course the budget airline industry has grown hugely in the past  years.Butwe want to be able to continue to fly to Spain for a tenner , the reintroduction of duty free is going to be a signicant influence on what airlines can offer by way of cheap tickets.The fuss over Sajid Javid’s proposal has reopened isions in the Government over so-called “sin taxes” on booze and fags.For some, like Matt Hancock, who this week praised the sugar levy on fizzy drinks, sin taxes are a useful instrument for persuading us to lead healthier lives. Others, the Prime Minister included, are more guarded.The problem with slapping taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and unhealthy food is that they are regressive taxes which impact disproportionately on the poor.I would say to Matt Hancock: Give us all the advice on healthy living that you can. And I don’t object to proportionate taxes which reflect the cost of medical care for smokers and excessive drinkers.But leave it to us to decide how we want to lead our lives — and don’t deny us a small pleasure like being able to buy a small duty-free treat on our way home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is because they are so far apart that architects had to factor in the curvature of Earth.Today, it’s still as unnecessary as it ever was. And it’s no longer the longest suspension bridge in the world. But it remains, in my opinion, the most beautul.In fact, and I’ve said this often, it’s the most beautul man-made thing of all time. Apart from maybe the Riva Aquarama speedboat.When I stand on the south shore on a misty morning and see the wafer-thin road disappearing off into the sea, it takes my breath away. It really does.So I’m glad it was made. And I’m glad too that the Labour government also built the Post Office Tower, even though it is now just a hazard to aircraft.Then there’s Concorde. The world did not need such a thing.And the technical challenges facing the engineers were huge. A Nasa boffin once told me that getting a passenger plane up beyond Mach  was more dficult than putting a man on the moon.But that old commie Tony Benn had decided Concorde was going to succeed, so he pushed and he pushed and, by God, are we glad he did.Can you imagine such a thing Because even though the beautul white bird is now grounded, we still have those memories of the shattering noise it made and the way it could make the sun rise in the West.I remember once, standing on a beach in Barbados as a British Airways Concorde roared overhead at treetop height.After it had passed, a stunned American on the next sun lounger looked at me and said: “You Brits.”I was so proud, I didn’t get round to telling him it was half French.Since Concorde though, Britain hasn’t really done anything of any great importance. There’s been talk of a new railway line from London to Manchester, but in evolutionary terms that’s just a shuffle. And now it probably won’t happen anyway.Which is why I am SO excited about the idea of a bridge linking Larne, in Northern Ireland with Portpatrick, in Scotland.Weirdly, the Labour Party — the party that created the Post Office Tower and Concorde and the Humber Bridge — are furious, saying it’s not needed and will be too expensive and it’s only been suggested to get Boris out of his backstop hole.But can you imagine such a thing A -mile bridge supported on columns ,ft high, and rising even higher in the middle so ships can pass underneath. It would be magnicent.Yes, it would be dficult to make. The seas there are rough and deep and the seabed is littered with discarded Second World War mines and bombs.But as John F Kennedy once said: “We choose to go to the moon and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”ACCORDING to a headline in The Times this week, The Handmaid’s Tale is increasingly ringing true.Really  We are heading for the terrying society portrayed in Margaret Atwood’s brilliant book A society where women are kept either for breeding or cleaning  Where girls can be killed for speaking  Or mutilated for looking at someone in a funny way And where children are taken away at birth and given to someone  I know cricket fan and woman Theresa May has suggested that Geoffrey Boycott, who has a conviction for domestic abuse, should be given a knighthood.But that’s a long, long way from sewing up the vagina of the woman he beat.I once saw a sufferer in Burma and the pain was so excruciating that powerful muscle spasms had snapped both his legs.And it wasn’t ordinary rabies our man in Morocco had caught either. It was “furious rabies” which causes extreme thirst and a morbid fear of water. At the same time.Mercully, he has now died. And we, meanwhile, are left to ponder what sort of a God comes up with a disease like that to end nearly , lives every year.ON the basis you should know your enemy, I read a book on holiday this year about why we shouldn’t kill animals.It wasn’t called – “If you eat meat, you’re a bastard”, but that was the thrust.And after a while, I deliberately left it in the rain, so I didn’t have to finish it.However, since I ed to Britain about a month ago, I still haven’t been able to eat pork.Cows  Chickens  Sheep  Not really bothered.But some of the things I read in that book about how pigs can play video games and feel love – they stuck.And so did the bit about how frightened they look when they are being taken to the slaughterhouse.I tried this morning to have a bacon sandwich but I couldn’t bring myself to put it in my mouth.It’s annoying. Pork was always my favourite meat but I’ll have to find a substitute.I’m thinking badger. Or maybe a nice roast fox.I know people who’ve found lost phones in their trouser pockets, and most women are of capable losing anything up to a medium-sized dog in their handbags.But I’ve never heard of anyone losing themselves. Until now.A party of tourists on a bus tour of Iceland spent hours searching for a missing passenger only to find she was in the search party.She hadn’t recognised the description of herself and it wasn’t until three in the morning that her mistake became clear.Bet she was popular.AT long last, space boffins have found a planet which they reckon could be capable of supporting le.They will know soonit has an atmosphere but they’ve already worked out that the romantically named K-b does have water. And it’s only million million miles away, which means that with current technology, we could reach it in just two million years.The only problem I can see is that it’s twice the size of Earth, with eight times the mass, so any astronaut who had survived the -light year journey would weigh quite a lot when he arrivedSo much, in fact, that after a little while, his brain would be dragged into his spinal cord.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some of us voted for Theresa May’s deal, not because it was perfect but because it delivered on the result of the referendum.Others couldn’t support it because they felt it was a ‘blind Brexit’ — a leap into the unknown — and asked May to come back with something better.But we are all agreed on one thing.After May held cross-party talks with Labour in May  she came back with ten changes to her deal, and we all believe that this compromise package was more likely to get through Parliament.We all believed at the time that MPs should have been able to debate and vote on this, but sadly it was rejected by second referendum advocates and no-dealers.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill, as it’s known, included protection of workers’ rights, food standards and the environment, which would have benefited us all.We now hope that Boris Johnson brings a similar offer back to Parliament so we can vote on it.Sometimes it’s easy to forget that  Conservative MPs backed May’s deal in March this year while more than  other MPs voted for dferent forms of a Brexit in indicative votes.The desire to agree a Brexit deal is there.A failure to do so may well result in the consequences set out in the government’s own ‘Operation Yellowhammer’ no-deal report.Sensible MPs desperately need to face down the isive voices on either side and come together in the national interest.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was short of breath, he was breathing heavily.It was very concerning that he would have signicant lung damage and possibly some residual changes after he heals from this.Adam, who has since been discharged from hospital but is still recovering, is urging people not to vape.He said: I dont want to see anybody in my situation. I dont want to see anybody in the hospital for as long as I was.The teen admits he took up the habit to fit in, adding that everyone  was doing it.Adam said: It didnt taste like a cigarette. It tasted good.He said the flavours appealed to him, especially mango, and the nicotine provided a buzz.He would wake up in the morning and would puff on that Juul and then cough, said mum Polly.Eventually, he went from vaping over-the-counter e-liquids to vaping THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana.But it was soon after that he started to feel unwell and eventually ended up in hospital.Adam said: If I had known what it was doing to my body, I would have never even touched it, but I didnt know. I wasnt educated.San Francisco-based Juul said in a statement that its never marketed to youth and has ongoing campaigns to combat underage use.It added that its products are meant to help adult smokers wean themselves off traditional paper-and-tobacco cigarettes, which Juul called the deadliest legal consumer product known to man.Among the precautions Juul said its taken to ensure young people arent drawn to its e-cigarettes was to close Juuls Facebook and Instagram accounts.The firm said it has also deployed technology that restricts a sale until someones age is veried.Theyre not completely risk free, but they carry a small fraction of the risk of cigarettes.E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most harmful elements in tobacco smoke.The liquid and vapour contain some potentially harmful chemicals also found in cigarette smoke, but at much lower levels.While nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes, its relatively harmless.Almost all of the harm from smoking comes from the thousands of other chemicals in tobacco smoke, many of which are toxic.Nicotine replacement therapy has been widely used for many years to help people stop smoking and is a safe treatment.Theres no evidence so far that vaping causes harm to other people around you.This is in contrast to secondhand smoke from smoking, which is known to be very harmful to health.Source: NHSHis ordeal follows a spike of mysterious and le-threatening lung diseases - believed to be linked to vaping -

We do not eat them, and that is a very important message to send to the rest of the world.“It’s not culturally insensitive because we’re not telling them what to do – we’re just telling them what we do.“We shouldn’t be worrying about that, so I was surprised that was the MoJ’s objection.”Justice officials also argued that it would be dficult to enforce the law and the current ban on transporting or exporting dog and cat meat suffices.Eating dog is already banned in Germany, Austria, Taiwan, South Australia and Hong Kong.An estimated  million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.Most are stolen off the street.Their meat it is considered both a delicacy and a health tonic.The World Dog Alliance mounted a campaign in the UK last year for a full ban on any activity relating to the eating of dogs.A series of MPs back a ban, including former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan who dubbed it “a disgusting habit”.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “We currently have some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world.The government is currently considering whether any changes are needed in this area in the UK and will set out any plans in due course.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even Top Gear presenter Freddie Flintoff has admitted he’s interested in the idea, recently saying “anything is possible”.Blogger Mark Sargent, who has become a celebrity since starring in the Netflix show, was one of the speakers at the conference, where tickets cost £ for one day and £ for the full residential treatment.Mark, , who has just finished a European tour taking in Stockholm, Dublin, Belfast and Cardf, thinks we live on a flat disc covered by a dome — a bit like a snow globe.But he admitted: “To prove that we would have to have our own rocket program.”Others claim gravity is a myth, there is no such thing as space, the Sun isn’t million miles away and the edge of the planet is a huge wall of ice.Tech worker Robin Campbell organised the weekend event, called Globe Lie UK Convention. The -year-old, from Bristol, delivered the opening lecture on Saturday in a darkened hall at a Christian centre in the village of Cleobury Mortimer.It was a beginner’s guide, packed with slides and photos of supposedly devastating “evidence.”The theory rests on the idea that Nasa — and all the other space agencies — have been faking images of Earth. The obvious question is: “Why would the world’s most powerful nations spend trillions on bogus space programs ”According to Robin and Mark, they discovered secret lands “beyond the rim” of our pancake-shaped planet in  during an expedition to Antarctica. At that point they realised Earth wasn’t a globe, but didn’t tell the rest of us because they wanted to keep the resources in these outer lands, including gold and oil, for themselves.Among the believers is craftsman Ruben Dario Jaramillo, who was selling £ models of flat earth.The -year-old Londoner told me: “My we Cynthia thought I was cheating on her because I was spending so much time researching flat earth theories.”Cynthia is now a believer as well.Instead of having to explain how a flat Earth could possibly work, the movement’s followers prefer to deny the spherical option.Tony Riley, , from Liverpool, doesn’t classy himself as a “Flat Earther” and says he is searching for proof we live on a ball.Clearly passionate about the subject, the businessman eloquently described some of the scientic experiments he has carried out as he questions long established theories.Tony thinks gravity is a “pseudo-science”. He said he doesn’t “know where the Sun is”, and “maths doesn’t prove the real world”. Having said we should only believe what we can observe, he then dismissed the existence of the International Space Station which, with a decent telescope, can be seen orbiting the Earth.Tony said: “It does look like a structure, but it looks holographic.”Mother-of-two Roxanne Glen, from London, prefers to be called a “globe sceptic”. She said: “Natural observations have told me the Earth is flat.”EXPERT: Autopilot ies the pitch to maintain altitude.CLAIM: If Earth is round, why can you see objects beyond the horizon EXPERT: Many factors come into play, such as the elevation of the land you are on, the height of the object and refraction causing light to bend.CLAIM: We’d feel itEarth was rotating at ,mph while hurtling through space.EXPERT: We can’t feel Earth move as we move with it at the same speed.CLAIM: It’s been covered up that explorer Admiral Richard E Byrd found land as big as the US beyond the South Pole.The -year-old building liaison worker believes schools are breaking the law by not teaching pupils that our planet could either be spherical or flat — or something .Roxanne has a YouTube channel and goes to Speakers Corner in London every month to persuade others of the “truth”.Everyone at the event had the same message — seek out the facts.That’s certainly good advice to anyone tempted to follow the globe deniers down their rabbit hole of misinformation and half truths.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But some members were concerned that the new message wouldnapost reach out to people who havenapost yet been convinced by the partyaposs hardline Bollocks to Brexit campaign. Ms Swinson has claimed that the new position iss very clearin She explained: If the Liberal Democrats get a majority at the next election,the party put into government is a stop-Brexit party, then stopping Brexit is exactly what they will get. People deserve better than Boris Johnson’s No Deal Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Brexit. At the next election, voters can instead choose the Liberal Democrats, and our clear and unequivocal policy to Stop Brexit.Before an election is called, the Lib Dems will continue to work cross-party to prevent a dangerous No Deal Brexit, and support a People’s Vote, with the option to remain. We will do all we can to fight for our place in Europe, and to stop Brexit altogether. Introducing the motion, the partyaposs Brexit spokesman Tom Brake MP outlined the proposal. He told conference delegates: A Liberal Democratic majority government will revoke Article . We will put an end then and there to the Brexit nightmare that is tearing the country apart. But he explained thatthe party falls short of governing alone, which with just  MPs currently seems likely , the priority remains to back a Peopleaposs Vote    Mr Brake said that Lib Dem performance in local and European elections show that revoking is no longer a pipedream We are in reach of forming a democratic majority government, Mr Brake added. But Lib Dem MEP Chris Davies warned that while the partyaposs Brexit position was helpful in earning support - that the motionaposs hardline message wouldnapost win over unsure voters. He said: Sixths months ago the European elections were not going to happen but today I stand here as part of the largest Lib Dem group ever to take our seats in the European Parliament. The problem with this motion is as a message it is not enough, it doesnapost reach out, it doesnapost give us the numbers, and it doesnapost reach out to the central ground.    Nothing in this motion helps us convince people whose minds are not completely closed. Despite the fiery invective, the Lib Dem MEP later voted for the motion.

Instagram blogger Joanna Heard, , learned in July she had a tumour and thought she would be dead in a year. A month later she told she was ALK-positive, a genetic condition mainly affecting young and middle-aged women who are usually light or, like Joanna, non-smokers. While drugs to shrink the tumours are available on the NHS, the coffee shop worker says le expectancy is currently still only around seven years, LancashireLive reports.  Joanna, who describes herself as an ALK-positive lung cancer warrior, has set up the @justamammafightingcancer Instagram blog. It helps her to come to terms with the everyday struggles, while shining a light on a little understood condition.Joanna admitted when she was diagnosed she was knocked for six and dark thoughts entered her head. She said: “It was surreal. It was like aposthis only happens to everyone apos, I’m just your average -year-old mum. “My general feeling was I’m going to be dead in a year.  “You’re having to sit there and think realistically ‘ they can offer me chemotherapy, is it worth it ’To go through those thoughts and emotions was terrying, but people face it every single day.” Doctors had suspected Joanna, who is planning her wedding to partner Daniel Jonathan on Good Friday next year, had chest infections, pneumonia and even pleurisy, and she is passionate about highlighting the problems of misdiagnosis and improper treatment. She said: “It is affecting more and more young people and not every hospital offers the testing of cells that finds these rare forms. “Not every oncologist in the country knows about it, which is quite scary. Sharing knowledge is sharing power against this awful disease.”  Joanna, who is originally from Southport, is on a daily treatment of tablets for le, however when she grows immune to the drug after three to five years she will require an alternative. She added: “Whenever this one stops working for me the next one will be available. “They’re very expensive, which is why they don’t offer genetic testing to everybody. “I’m still breathless and cannot walk very far. I’m now classed as disabled. I get quite a lot of nerve pain.” Joanna, of Peel Street, says writing the blog has helped her greatly to stay in an optimistic frame of mind and also helped her friends and family to deal with what she is going through.

The number of cattle slaughtered because of TB rose from , in , when badger culling began, to , in -. It is estimated , badgers are likely to suffer “immense pain” in culls, according to former government adviser Prof Ranald Munro, with % taking more than five minutes to die after being shot. Prof Munro’s remarks come as he and  other vets, scientists and animal welfare campaigners wrote to Natural England, the body that oversees the culls. A  independent review of strategies for tackling tuberculosis also warned against an “over-emphasis” on the role of wildle in its spread and concluded badgers were not the primary cause. It said transmission was greater from cattle to cattle and suggested farmers needed to do more to prevent it.  It also found culling had only a modest effect in curbing TB. But the government never responded, instead prioritising the views of Tory-voting farmers and landowners over those of highly respected scientists.

In sharing your story of being HIV+, you are saving lives and shattering stigma, by showing you can be strong and resilient while living with HIV.” Gareth approached the Sunday Mirror to go public about his HIV diagnosis. He said: “I’m really happy with the way the Sunday Mirror told my story to the world.” He added: “It got the message across in the right way. I’m so thankful to the Mirror for its support for my campaign and for telling my story how I wanted it to be told. We can reveal Sir Elton John – who has launched a global HIV coalition with Harry – phoned Gareth to praise his bravery. Gareth’s pal Prince William sent a message of support, saying: “Courageous as ever – legend on the pitch and legend off it.” Gareth hopes that he and Harry can have the same impact on public awareness of the condition as the princes’ late mother Princess Diana. She was credited with changing attitudes towards HIV and AIDS in  when she was pictured at the UK’s first AIDS clinic, shaking hands with a man dying from the condition.    Until then, many people thought it could be contracted by touch. Former Wales and British Lions captain Gareth said: “Quite often I look at that photo of Diana at the clinic next to those frail looking men and then I look at a photo of myself out on my bike and it motivates me because I can see how things have changed and advanced. “It also makes me realise how lucky I am because I see what it was like for them and I know  years ago that could have been me.” Gareth and Harry, who turned  yesterday, are in talks with the UK’s leading HIV and sexual health charity, the Terrence Higgins Trust, about how and when they will work together. It is understood they will focus on the need for more people to be tested to help Britain meet its target of eradicating new transmissions by . Harry has carried on his mother’s ground-breaking work. He has gone public with his own HIV tests to raise awareness of how important they are. His charity Sentebale provides healthcare and education to children affected by poverty or HIV and AIDS in Africa.    In the Sunday Mirror exclusive, Gareth said: “I’ve chosen to speak out about this in the Sunday Mirror because it’s the paper I trust...I’ve been living with this [HIV] secret for years. I had a fear people would treat me like a leper because of a lack of knowledge. “I was feeling suicidal. To me, wanting to die... felt like the easier way out, but you have to confront things. “Many people live in fear and shame of having HIV, but I refuse to be one of them now. I’m speaking out because I want to help others.” He has now also talked about the support he has received from the likes of Sir Elton, who runs his own AIDS foundation. Gareth said: “He’s brilliant. He rang me the other day while I was on the M and said ‘Gareth, it’s Elton’. I had to pull the car over.    “We had a massively supportive chat about me speaking out and he supports my reasoning and was nothing but positive. “He said ‘What you’re doing is a brilliant thing. It’s really brave of you. I’ll support you all the way’.” Gareth, who in  became the world’s most prominent athlete to come out as gay, added: “Elton works tirelessly to raise awareness and I’ve been to a lot of his [charity] dinners. “My actress friend Samantha Womack was one of the first people I told and [rugby star] Jonny Wilkinson and [Erasure singer] Andy Bell have also been so supportive.” Gareth, who is known as Alfie in the rugby world and is a Cardf City fan, completed the gruelling Ironman Wales challenge yesterday to show he is still strong despite his diagnosis.    There were constant cries from the crowd of “Come on, Alfie” just hours after he revealed his diagnosis in the Sunday Mirror. He hugged his parents and husband Stephen in emotional scenes during the event in Tenby, Pembs. Competitors have to swim . miles, then cycle  miles before running a marathon . Gareth, who only has to take one tablet a day and says despite his diagnosis he is even fitter than in his playing days, wants millions of Brits to get tested for HIV. He said: “So many people think HIV only happens to gay people or people in Africa, but that’s the biggest load of b******s ever. “HIV doesn’t discriminate. I felt HIV was never going to affect me, but it did.”    More than , people are receiving HIV treatment in Britain, but about one in eight with the virus are undiagnosed and unaware. Some people with HIV do not show symptoms for years. Four in  of those diagnosed in  were told at a late stage of their infection, meaning damage to the immune system had already begun. There is currently no cure for HIV or AIDS. But advances in medicine mean people living with HIV in countries with good access to healthcare very rarely develop AIDS once they are receiving treatment. With the right treatment, le expectancy for a person who carries the virus is now approaching that of a person who tests negative.    Gareth, who made his international debut in , winning  caps for Wales as a rugby union star, and four as a rugby league player, retired in . Gareth, an ITV pundit at the Rugby World Cup starting on Friday, added: “People need to know it’s OK to have a sexual health test. You don’t need to be gay to have an HIV test. “The amount of people who don’t know their status is frightening, it’s got to be in the millions. People need to be tested and to know.

Oscar Lundahl, , nearly jumped out of his fishing boat when he saw the bizarre-looking species with bulbous eyes on the end of his line. The specimen is in actual fact a ratfish, whose Latin name Chimaeras Monstrosa Linnaeus is aptly derived from a Greek mythical monster that had the head of a lion and tail of a dragon. The fish - a relative of the shark that dates back  million years - live in deep water and are very rarely caught.  Although ratfish are harmless to humans and feed on crustaceans like crabs and sea snails, their odd appearance is enough give any angler worth their salt the creeps. Their huge eyes are believed to have been developed to help them see at such dark depths. Oscar was fishing for the blue halibut when he caught the ratfish by mistake off the island of Andoya in northern Norway. He had four hooks on his line with mackerel as bait and was fishing in ,ft of water at the time. Oscar, a fishing guide for Nordic Sea Angling, said: We were looking for blue halibut which is a rare species about five miles off shore.

But would working, rather than eating, at one of The Colonelaposs finger lickinapos good eateries be a zinger of a day, or fillet with surprises  Somerset Liveaposs reporter Michael Taylor - donning the KFC apron and cap - spent a day behind the scenes at a branch in Taunton, Somerset, to find out. Here is what he learnt:  You wash your hands at nearly every point    The first thing you do going into the kitchen is rigorously wash your hands. This is a necessary procedure before touching any food and to avoid any contamination. Employees can then either prepare the food with their hands or wear gloves.  Every piece of chicken is fresh If youaposre curious what the state of the chicken is before itaposs prepared for cooking, rest assured that the chicken is fresh. With regular deliveries, the branch doesnapost use frozen chicken. The thighs, wings, breasts and legs all arrive bagged and ready for preparation.  Thereaposs a very specic aposseven-ten-sevenapos technique to breading the chicken  One of the crew members showed the thorough process of how pieces of chicken are prepared. Straight from a fridge, he poured the meat into a basket where it was washed in water before being shaken seven times to help dry it. With regular deliveries, the branch doesnapost use frozen chicken.The chicken, which included fillets, breasts and legs, is then tipped into a bowl of flour mixed with salt, spices and the secret KFC recipe. The flour is folded over the meat  times before pieces are picked up and patted down seven times. Any excess flour is dusted off and itaposs then placed on a grill. The restaurantaposs manager, Alice Yarde, said the chicken is cooked evenly so the oil flows through the meat.  ...but thereaposs a dferent way to prepare drumsticks While itaposs straight forward to cook most bits of chicken, itaposs slightly dferent for drumsticks. Drumsticks are double breaded before being placed in the fryer. An employee said this was to ensure the meat cooks properly and its skin doesnapost crack.  Every batch goes through the same cooking process The meat is fried in oil at C. Each batch goes in the fryer for  minutes and then is left to drain for five minutes before it can be served. Once cooked, the chicken has to reach the customer within an hour-and-a-half.  The kitchen smells like chicken heaven This is a very obvious point but the kitchen has a nice whf of chicken, spice and herbs.  The delicious smell made my stomach rumble a few times.  Building a fillet burger is enjoyable In comparison to breading the chicken pieces, this was more straightforward and less stressful. I was whisked to the other end of the kitchen to the sandwich section to make my own classic fillet burger. Yum. You can pick from dferent sauces or add bacon, lettuce, cheese or hash browns to your burger. I was able to go at my own pace and add my lettuce, salsa and cheese to a tasty toasted bun. Accompanied with a Pepsi Max and fries, it was a filling and satisfying meal.     Leftover food is left inside a heated holding cabinet If itaposs a slow day or thereaposs an excess of chicken, the meat isnapost just left to cool on the side. After the chicken has been drained of oil, employees stick the grill tray into a heated holding cabinet. If, for example, a fillet is required for a burger, a crew member would take a warm piece and place it in a bun.  The kitchen was spotless The kitchen was tidy with no leaks or spillages and employees clearly followed a strict hygiene code. There was no grabbing the pieces of chicken with our fingers or handling the other food items. We had to use metal tongues for all items which have been deep fried. The East Street branch currently has a food hygiene rating of five and was found to be aposvery goodapos in food handling, cleanliness and management of food safety.

Victoria Hunter had no idea she had driven through an enforcement zone off limits to regular traffic during a temporary trial in her home county of Gloucestershire. She was unaware she had done anything wrong until an enforcement officer arrived at her Cheltenham home, Gloucestershire Live reported. The original £ fine issued on November  last year had grown to £ due to all of the subsequent late payment add-ons.    The escalated total struck the single mother as unfair however, because she had not been aware of the fine until the bailf knocked on her door. Victoria, who is mum to two-year-old Harry, said: “I didn’t get any warning letter. Genuinely, the first I knew of it was when there was an enforcement agent at my door. “It’s brought me to tears. I had a panic attack that day he knocked on my door.” Since the -year-old was visited on August  she has contacted Gloucestershire County Council complaing about not receiving a warning about the fine. She was asked to put the matter in writing and told she would receive a response in  days. Victoria suggested the council may have been sending letters to her old address in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, which she left on October  last year. The car she had driven during the offence had been registered to that address. Now the mum is worried she may have to sell her car to cover the debt.

I was drinking to knock myself out.”Ian, , of Earn Crescent, said his le was so low he had suicidal thoughts of slitting his wrists and jumping off the Tay Road Bridge.He said: “I kept a diary. I wrote in it every day the amount of times I was sick, bleeding, diarrhoea, then wrote that I just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up.”Ian desperately wanted out of the le of alcoholism but he did not know how he could escape it without dying.He said: “I was hospitalised dozens of times.“I wasn’t the master of my le anymore, alcohol was the master of me, everything I did revolved around it.“I lived in a slum.“There was blood everywhere, spewing everywhere, mouldy drink cans, pee all over the place – I knew it was a slum but I didn’t care.”It got so bad that Ian could not walk or talk and was checked into former psychiatric hospital Sunnyside in Montrose three times for detoxication by his family.But it was only following the third time Ian made the conscious decision to stay sober – a feat he’s managed for  years now.He said: “I’m not proud of myself.“I don’t look at the past, I just take each day at a time.“I tell myself I’m sober today and the rest slowly takes care of itself.”Ian now keeps himself busy with activities such as drawing and creative projects at Just Bee Productions.The community group offers people a safe space to be creative and connect with others at vulnerable times in their lives.Ian said: “Getting involved with Just Bee is one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.“It keeps my mind busy and gives me something positive to focus on and it’s good to be around people again, instead of sitting in the house on my own all day with just my thoughts.”Ian and about  other participants in the group are gearing up to start working on a musical theatre show called This is a Mental Musical.Claire Bee, founder of Just Bee Productions, said: “The show is about mental health and everything that goes along with that.“It’s also about giving people a  to have a voice to say what they want to say.”The show will be performed in Dundee and the group hopes to take it to Edinburgh Fringe Festival next year.Former plays performed by Just Bee include Drink, The Musical which toured community venues in Dundee, including nearby prisons, and another musical called Next Stop Please.Former heroin addict Cheryl Ferguson, , said: “Doing the musicals has helped to build up my confidence, self worth and a feeling that I belong.“It’s opened up opportunities which I wouldn’t have thought were possible and I’ve met loads of brilliant people who are like family now.“I love it. No drugs can give that sort of feeling.“The first time I did it, I came off stage and felt brilliant and it wasn’t brought on by any substance.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ariana-grande-everything-need-know-hydro-gig","story":"POP powerhouse Ariana Grande will play the Hydro on Tuesday night."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

with St Johnstone.The Perth Saints are languishing second bottom of the Premiership and have yet to win a league game this season.They arrived at Pittodrie having won just once in eight games this season, against League Two strugglers Brechin City in the League Cup.However they frustrated the flat and uninspiring  Dons in a match where the Perth side had a penalty award over-ruled after referee Steven McLean had initially awarded a spot kick.Former Aberdeen striker Stevie May made a quick-fireto Pittodrie having recently signed a two year contract with St Johnstone following his Dons exit.A £, signing from Preston North End in summer  the Dons cancelled the final two years of May#s contract two weeks ago to make way for the -year-old#s permanent move to Saints.May netted just eight goals in  appearances for the Dons over two seasons.He did not end a goal drought dating back to a penalty kick scored in Aberdeen#s - loss to Celtic on December  last year.Boss Derek McInnes retained faith with the same starting line-up that defeated Ross County - at Pittodrie before the international break.Shay Logan ed to the squad having missed the match against the Staggies with a groin problem but had to be content with a spot on the substitutes# bench.The goal scoring heroics of Connor McLennan on international duty was not enough to elevate the winger into the starting .McLennan came off the bench for the Scotland U#s and netted two late goals to secure a - European championships qualier away win.In a low key opening Saints created the first opportunity in the th minute when Matty Kennedy picked out Murray Davidson  yards out but his shot trundled wide.The woodwork denied Aberdeen in the th minute when superb skill from Greg Leigh saw the left#back control the ball then step wide of his marker before firing in a dangerous ball into the box.Leading scorer Sam Cosgrove met the cross and his header cracked off the base of the far post.Aberdeen went ahead in the th minute when the impressive Leigh burst towards the left side of the box. He was tenacious and drove forward only to be tackled.The ball broke to HEDGES who clinically shot beyond Zander Clark from  yards.St Johnstone equalized in the nd minute courtesy of a rare mistake from keeper Joe Lewis.A pass from Scott Tanser was cut back to Michael O#HALLORAN who shot low from  yards out. There was no power in the trundler but somehow the ing Lewis let the effort go under his hands.The goal came completely out of the blue.In the th minute Saints won a free-kick  yards out. May#s weak effort was straight at keeper Lewis who easily saved.Moments later St Johnstone again threatened when Davidson latched onto a Jason Holt corner only to send a ing  yard header just wide.Saints were looking the more likely to score and Lewis redeemed his earlier mistake in the th minute with a strong near post block to push behind a vicious Davidson  yard drive.St Johnstone were raging in the th minute when referee Steven McLean pointed to the penalty spot # only to change his mind following a conversation with his official.The penalty was initially given when Kennedy went down and appeared to have his heel clipped by Andy Considine.McLean gave the penalty, which appeared soft. However, so rare in Scottish football, the refereeing not only took time to think he also used common sense.Following consultation with assistant Graeme Stewart on the touch-line McLean over-ruled his initial decision.Aberdeen were denied by a superb save from Clark in injury time when Ferguson#s powerful  yard free kick took a defection off the defensive wall but the keeper did brilliantly to adjust and save to secure a deserved point for St Johnstone.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Vyner, Devlin, Considine, Leigh, Ojo, Ferguson, Bryson, McGinn, Hedges, Cosgrove.Subs: Gallagher , McLennan , Wilson Subs not used: Cerny, Logan,  Anderson, Main.ST JOHNSTONE:  Clark, Ralston, Kerr, Gordon, Tanser, O’Halloran, McCann, Davidson, Holt, Kennedy, May.Subs: Wright , Hendry , Kennedy Subs not used:  Parish, Vihmann,  Duffy, Swanson.Referee: Steven McLean"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.25281212-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.25281212-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.25281212-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.25281212-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen pupils asked to pick items for new time capsule","story":"Aberdeen school pupils are being invited to choose items that will be placed in a time capsule.Aberdeen Science Centre will bury the capsule in the structure of its building which is currently undergoing a major refurbishment.The centre launched a competition, open until next week, asking pupils to come forward with suggestions as to what items will be included.All the suggested items will be put to a public vote and the most popular will be placed inside.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day.

There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"an album with atmosphere and depth","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowExtract of an album review by Marc HigginsThis striking album is a collaboration between singer songwriter Sheila K Cameron and John Saich and Mags Russell of Argyll#s Wild Biscuit productions.In  they collaborated on an album called More Like a River than a Road. These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

This has been communicated to the providers of the mobile banking service previously.#An alternative location, at the Newton car park where no fees would be charged, has been suggested in the past and remains an option.#Previous parking spots for the mobile unit, including one beside the former RBS building, have proved unsuitable because of traffic and parking conflicts.The Argyllshire Advertiser approached RBS for comment but the bank failed to respond."},{"url":null,"title":"thanks inveraray we couldnt have done it without you","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCelebration was in the air on a gorgeous Inveraray evening.A crowd numbering around  # made up of proud locals mixed with the odd slightly bemused tourist # joined together to mark the success of Inveraray and District Pipe Band.Laid on by Inveraray Community Council, a reception was held on September  on the green as the air cooled at the end of a beautul sunny Saturday.And, to mark the occasion, the band was presented with a celebratory quaich from Argyll and Bute Council, handed over by veteran councillor Donnie MacMillan.On August  on Glasgow Green, and for the second time in three years, Inveraray and District Pipe Band won the Grade  world title. With the world championship they also secured the Champion of Champions accolade for the fourth year in a row.The band#s success has been remarkable since being formed with Inveraray  youngsters just  years ago by current leaders Pipe Major Stuart Liddell and lead drummer Steven McWhirter. The band rose rapidly through the ranks, winning the world title, and many others besides, at every grade in which it competed.Inveraray is now established as the Grade  band to beat and players are attracted from around the world # but regardless of its international make-up, Inveraray still lies at its heart.That fact was clearly in evidence as the reception was crowned by a magical performance by the world champions, enjoyed by all and captured for posterity on the many mobile phones raised to the heavens.Speaking as he presented the quaich, Councillor MacMillan congratulated the band on its success, achieved in a relatively short period of time thanks to the dedication of all concerned.Argyll and Bute MP Brenan O#Hara said the band#s success has been #absolutely remarkable# and quipped that Inveraray#s success had turned him into a #born-again piper#, so inspired has he been.Pipe Major Stuart Liddell, Inveraray born and bred and from a line of superb pipers, said: #I want to thank all band members for their hard work over the past several years, and of course their families who have put up with so much and made sacrices for it to happen # particularly those with young families. It is greatly appreciated.#He added: #Thanks to the town of Inveraray and everyone  who has supported us. We couldn#t have done it without you.#And it was on to a selection of brilliant tunes to entertain the adoring fans clustered around the green.Speaking after the event, Inveraray Community Council convenor Linda Divers said: #Thanks to everyone who came out to show their support to Inveraray and District Pipe Band, and to Councillor Donnie MacMillan for coming along tonight.#The community council would like to thank all helpers as well as the British Legion and the band for the use of their tents. The Inveraray Inn provided a fantastic buffet and thanks to Karen for her assistance.She added: #I think we could all hear on Saturday why Inveraray and District are world champions!#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe dficult financial times we live in makes for tough choices on spending, there is no doubt about that.The decision to close Ashfield school in Achnamara was dficult, but it was based on educational reasons, according to the committee.Barring appeal it#s a done deal, but the building remains.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

The Walking Festival is back in Selkirk again and the two events have come together to make a great community experience.Sue Briggs from the Walking Festival says both benefit from each other: \"Having the two adds a new dimension to the events.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

Burn today, who cares about tomorrow. But just as reality crushed the flatearthers in the late th century, the harsh reality of a climate crisis dawned in the th century ndash and time for more serious action is now well overdue.Scotland has made pretty decent progress though. Over the last century we have seen the development of Scottish hydro generation, with large scale and pumped storage systems , getting us off to a reasonable start.:How traffic wardens could lead the fight over greenhouse gasesThe last  years have seen signicant development of onshore and offshore wind farms and solar , generating signicantly more power today than hydro. Much to the displeasure of those who donrsquot like the look of wind turbines, the sky has not fallen in on the tourism industry, and windfarms continue to be popular . Scotland can now boast over % of its net electricity needs being met from renewable sources and nearly % of Scots support onshore wind farms, that is more impressive than most reliable polls on most issues.There are always those few contrarians to scientic consensus of course, some who have a personal distaste for wind turbines, or those who are ardent supporters of coal, nuclear, oil and gas for one reason or another. Age also seems to be a factor, with many more young people demanding greater urgency. To properly tackle climate change, we need to seriously up our game. Scotland currently scores two out of , because electricity accounts for only about % of our energy and emissions. Heating homes and fuelling industry, land use and agriculture, providing hot water and powering our cars and transport system account for the rest ndash and we have barely scratched the surface of those sectors. There are some emerging plans and initiatives on renewable heat, transport and in energy efficiency measures ndash but the reality remains that there is both a long, long way to go and a need to do it very, very quickly.The good news is that a modern, renewable energy-based economy is certainly within our grasp. We have the technology. Green electricity can fill most of the gap, and we have a lot more of it that can be developed with the right public policy and planning environment. Therersquos plenty of space in Scotland for a substantial increase in well-sited onshore wind and solar farms ndash the cheapest forms of new power generation. We need more storage of energy in large and small scale batteries, more lsquopumpedrsquo hydro, extensive use of heat pumps and harnessing the power of the sea, through more localised energy systems using smart technology, using green hydrogen and being able to efficiently transfer energy across the country in a robust grid system. Scotland is blessed with the most incredible onshore and offshore wind resource which can not only power Scotland much more cheaply but become a major electricity export across the UK and into Europe.:City urged to train lsquocarbon literatersquo leadersThis can all be achieved, from today. We donrsquot need to keep on burning fossils like therersquos no tomorrow, nor is there a need to back nuclear like therersquos no overdraft limit, evenit was a reliable, safe source of low carbon energy with no waste issue for future generations to deal with ndash which is all highly questionable.As I write this, I can sense the letter writing brigade getting excited. Some will reference impact on peatland, a current favourite of the naysayersndash even though wind farms have been shown to deliver positive net gain, even more so when built with good quality habitat management plans and good construction techniques avoiding areas of very deep peat. Some say therersquos lsquono point in Scotland doing anything, wersquore too small, look at Chinarsquos emissionsrsquo. I would not make any excuses for Chinese carbon emissions, nor those of the US which are double that of China per capita.We can choose to be responsible, lead, take opportunities and create an economy built on a renewable energy system, or not. Pointing somewhere  as a way of abdicating responsibility is a just a wee bit rubbish.It is possible that our whole economy, every job, every business and warm home, every vehicle, hospital and school ndash can be, and arguably should be, powered by renewable, sustainable energy. Unsustainable, non-renewable sources pass responsibility to future generations to deal with the fallout, and that is perhaps why so many young people see the issues so clearly and are now courageously speaking out so loudly.

The report suggests problems in the ventilation system in other parts of the hospitals.A report by Health Protection Scotland was also passed to The Herald on Sunday, expressing concerns about plans to address problems with bone marrow transplant units, and minutes of a meeting with health chiefs about issues with the childrenrsquos bone marrow units just months after they opened.Today we can reveal the contents of the documents for the first time.WardsBoth the cancer ward in the RHC and the adult bone marrow transplant ward at the QEUH are described as having not been built for their purpose.Private contractor Innovated Design Solutions concluded in its investigation into ward A: ldquoWe anticipate the original accommodation design was not intended for use by patients with immune response impairment deficiency. On the contrary, the existing ventilation strategy would appear only likely to promote the risks associated with uncontrolled ingress of infectious aerosols into patient areas.On the adult bone marrow unit, Health Protection Scotland reports from October  state: ldquoThe decision to transfer the care of bone marrow transplant patients from the Beatson oncology unit to the QEUH was made in June . Construction of the QEUH was well established at this point and therefore the new unit was not purpose built.VentilationThe size of the device which takes air in and out of the hospital was selected incorrectly, according to the Innovated Design Solutions report. The document explains that the devices are only able to take in % of the air needed when filters inside the ventilation system are clean. As soon as filters start to get dirty, the amount of air the system can take in falls, reducing the number of times air can be circulated through the hospital. The report indicates the devices would need to be able to take in % of the air required to account for dirty filters.The report explains: ldquoAir handling units [AHUs] fans were not sized or selected to afford a spare % capacity, as suggested by record documentation.ldquoWhilst technical literature would suggest there is % capacity available in AHUs, the manufacturer has advised that fans motors were selected based on % duty with clean air filters .ldquoWe would emphasise the probability of these issues inadequacies being applicable to other air handling equipment installed within the AC [adult and childrenrsquos] hospital.The number of times air is circulated around wards is vital to patient safety. Patients with severely restricted immune systems should be in rooms with  air changes per hour, while people with more robust immune systems should have six air changes per hour. The ventilation report reveals that there were only three air changes per hour in the childrenrsquos cancer ward, describing this as ldquosignicantly lower than would normally be expected.The report states: ldquoIt should also be noted that current air change rates are not in accordance with recommendations defined within either [Scottish or UK guidelines on hospital ventilation].ldquoWhilst we were unable to locate documentation defining system design criteria, [UK guidelines on hospital ventilation] were available in . If there was an agreed deviation from recommendations defined within guidance documents, available at the time of design, we would expect this to be claried within the Health and Safety File documentation.Energy-saving devicesThermal wheels, which help to capture heat and save energy from ventilation systems, are common in large buildings but scientists have begun questioning their use in hospitals as they carry a risk of contamination. The devices are widely used in both the QEUH and RHC, as well as in the nearby Imaging Centre for Excellence and the learning and teaching facility on the campus.Investigators said they ldquoConsider this to identy a potential risk associated with cross-contamination and added: ldquoWe recommend this be further investigated and level of associated risk considered against the use of facilities. We anticipate the majority of AHUs installed within the building are also equipped with thermal wheels ie Critical Care, General Theatres, Theatre Recovery, Endoscopy, Ultra CT Suite, Nuclear Medicine. Again, we recommend this be further investigated.Record keepingSeveral anomalies were picked up by investigators at the private consultancy firm in terms of the records held for the RHC. During their investigations into ward A, they found ldquoevident anomalies with records such as those for the size of air handling units which did not match those installed.They said there was no record about why the number of air changes in the bedrooms was lower than the required amount and added: ldquoWe were unable to locate any detailshellip pertaining to an agreed deviation from recommended guidance.The device which supplies air into bedrooms was also noted as being incorrect in the records, with investigators finding the devices were ldquoincorrectly identied within record documentation, albeit ality is very similar. The sizes of pipes which carry air into the hospital were recorded dferently on two separate drawings ndash one stated they were xmm and another said they were xmm.Drawings of ventilation systems on other floors were also found to be inaccurate.Bone marrow unitsNHS Greater Glasgow and Clydemedical director Jenner Armstrong, Grant Archibald, the then-head of acute services, and Billy Hunter, head of facilities, as well as five other senior colleagues held a meeting in September  to discuss apparent problems with the childrenrsquos bone marrow transplant suites.The minutes of this meeting state they ldquoacknowledged clinical frustration about progress and the need to plan for patients currently waiting transplant.They also state that ldquotwo suites have been sealedto avoid air penetration from a source outwith the air handling unit and add ldquoBrookfield [contractor] could retrofit air handling unit modications hellip at an approximate cost of poundk per room.NHSGGC confirmed that upgrades were made to four of the suites, which had been used for bone marrow transplant patients, while four of the other suites were used to accommodate other children with cancer and were not upgraded.Health Protection Scotland documents raise concerns about plans to fix the adult bone marrow transplant suites in the QEUH, which had been emptied of patients several months after the hospital opened.The document states: ldquoThe decision to transfer the care of bone marrow transplant patients from the Beatson oncology unit to the QEUH was made in June . Construction of the QEUH was well established at this point and therefore the new unit was not purpose built.ldquoWhilst NHSGGC has continued to work towards recommendations, it is noted that the solution proposed does not meet guidance, nor does it seek to address all the recommendations hellip As a result, HFS cannot comment on the effectiveness of the measures intended to be put in place.Bone marrow transplant patients have now ed to the QEUH, following work undertaken in , according to NHSGGC.Experts opinionChristopher Shaw, director of the Medical Architecture design practice, said: ldquoThese are new buildings and there are errors. How it happened is a consequence of the complexity and unique nature of the projects and the mismatch of control systems to those projects.ldquoIn a building of this type there are hundreds of thousands of components. These are brought together by specication, design and construction through tens of thousands of controlling documents and databases. Itrsquos then assembled through thousands of contracts and warranties.ldquoItrsquos a one-off product. The complexity should be mitigated by guidance and standards. Those can be managed and maintained where there is a rolling programme of projects to recycle knowledge from mistakes and introduce evolutionary improvements.ldquoHowever, change in the procurement process has pushed lsquoriskrsquo to the contractor and since the banking crisis there has been a broken pipeline of work. Both of these have undermined that status and effectiveness of performance specication.Shaw added that while he was not an engineer, and had no in-depth knowledge of the Glasgow hospitals specically, he believed ldquothe issues identied are likely to be generic and occur where.He added: ldquoThey are undoubtedly serious and, in the case of an oncology unit, I would say critical.

If the contest had been restricted to party members, the result would have been much tighter.It is understood that ldquolist selections were on the agenda for the MSP group meeting last week and Leonard was asked about extending the franchise to trade union supporters.Leonard is said to have ruled nothing in or out, which his critics have interpreted as him trying to buy time ahead of a final decision next year.Such a move would likely give Labourrsquos biggest affiliated trade union, Unite, a huge say in candidate selections.The bulk of supporters who were recruited during the  contest were from Unite and the , amounted to around % of all voters.Asked earlier this year about the idea of trade union supporters having a vote in List selections, Leonard told this newspaper:ldquoI donrsquot anticipate having US-style primaries for the selection of candidates for the Scottish Labour party.Scottish Tory chief whip Maurice Golden said: ldquoRichard Leonard has scared off voters and alienated party members.

But he was downbeat. I asked why and his response still lingers: ldquoThis is the beginning, not the end.And so it has proven. The indyref, negotiated between the UK and Scottish Governments after the SNP won a Holyrood landslide in , was another chapter in the countryrsquos constitutional journey, not the finale.:Nicola Sturgeon urged to remove Monaco-based billionaire from adviser team\"Base camp isnt far off the summit now, Alex Salmond said, after Yes won nearly % of the vote.It has become almost a cliche to note that elements of the indyref campaign provided a foretaste of the Brexit referendum two years later, but all cliches contain an element of truth.In both referenda, a big chunk of the population ignored dire economic warnings and opted for the unknown. On both occasions, the same voters did not flinch from rejecting a political union and poking an old order in the eye.While the Yes campaign was in no way comparable to the malevolence of many elements of Vote Leave, the indyref also showcased the nastier side of politics ... on both sides. The media, particularly the BBC, was baited by an unsavoury minority, political opponents were intimidated on the street, and social media was often a cesspit.But the indyref was also a le-affirming experience for many Scots. An .% turnout ndash the highest of any referendum in UK history ndash was astonishing. Tens of thousands of people who had never shown an interest in politics were now switched on. Scotland has one of the most politically engaged citizenries in the world.Although independence and Brexit are fuelled by nationalism, one key dference separates both causes. Support for leaving the EU is disproportionately backed by the -plus age group, and opposed by the younger generation. Independence is hugely popular among the socially liberal --year-olds and resisted by older, wealthier voters. The demographics are not the same.A political realignment was the inevitable consequence of the referendum, with the SNP reaping the rewards. Independence used to be a niche interest for % of voters, but it became the main iding line in Scottish politics. Your view on the constitution now often determined your vote in elections.The SNP was on the losing side on September , but the Nationalists quickly became the main winner. Party membership shot up to , and they won an incredible  seats at the  general election. It was a sign of the SNPrsquos dominance that falling back to  seats two years later was portrayed as a failure.:Willie Rennie: Indyref should be blocked eventhe SNP Greens win Holyrood electionThe indyref, paradoxically, was also good for the Scottish Tories, who over the previous two decades had secured the patent of irrelevant also-rans. Just as the plebiscite served as a political awakening for nationalists, so too did it lead to a revival in unionism. The threat of independence is the Scottish Toriesrsquo political meal ticket.Scottish Labour, already in decline prior to the indyref, were the main losers from the campaign. The conventional narrative is that Labourrsquos participation in Better Together, alongside the Tories, hurt them electorally, but this is a flimsy argument.If Labour had campaigned separately for a No vote, the Yes sidersquos lethal \"red Tory\" insult would simply have been adapted. The indyref was always going to be a disaster for Labour. Once a lion, the party is now a mouse.The main lesson from  was confirmation,it was needed, that a referendum does not resolve binary constitutional issues. The  vote on joining the European Communities fuelled a bitter, -year debate. The devolution referendum in  led to an endless debate on Holyroodrsquos powers. The same is true of the indyref and the Brexit melodrama.And therein lies a challenge for Nicola Sturgeon. A second independence referendum looks likely and the bookies are predicting a Yes vote, but the First Minister should be mindful of the state of Scotland after another referendum and the effect a Yes vote would have.The stakes are much higher for the Unionist side. A Yes vote would never be overturned there would be no re-run five years later. Hundreds of thousands of voters would feel like the UK had been broken up, and that their identity had been shattered.It would be the heartbreak of a letime for these people.

They are notorious for feeding on clothing and natural fibres, especially wool, fur, silk, feathers, felt, and leather. These materials contain keratin, a fibrous protein that the worm-like larvae of the clothes moth can digest.

Because desflurane has a much more profoundly deleterious effect on the environment, in most situations it makes sense to choose sevoflurane.In surgeries that require a long anaesthetic, desflurane is the better choice because it is released from a patientrsquos body more quickly than the lower carbon alternative - allowing them to wake up more quickly.Dr Gallagher added: ldquoWhat wersquove tried to is make sure all our anaesthetic colleagues make an informed choice when theyrsquore deciding which one to use andthey do use desflurane it is because of sound clinical reasons and not just because itrsquos there.Other options to put patients to sleep include intravenous anaesthetics, which have even less impact on the environment.It has been estimated that one bottle of desflurane emits the same amount of co - one tonne- as a daily  mile round trip made by car for  weeks of the year.A recent study, published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal, highlights the potential for reducing emissions in health care settings and, at the same time, potentially reducing costs. Emissions due to anaesthetic gases accounted for approximately , tonnes of COe at two North American sites ndash ten-fold higher than the anaesthetic gas emissions from the UK hospital. The authors say this is largely the result of a higher usage of desflurane in the two North American hospitals.Dr Stephen Young, consultant anaesthetist, said ldquoThis is a really signicant environmental change, with a carbon dioxide equivalent reduction of  less cars commuting to the hospital every day. We have done this whilst maintaining high standards of anaesthetic care to our patients.ldquoIt has been estimated that five per cent of carbon dioxide equivalentemissions from acute hospitals are due to the use of inhalational agents. This is equivalent to around half the CO used to heat all hospital buildings and water.ldquoThis is just one of the areas in which NHSGGC is driving forward a focus on sustainability and making a dference to its carbon footprint.Dr Cathy Lawson is the National Fellow for Sustainable Anaesthesia for the Association of Anaesthetists and the Centre for Sustainable Health Care in collaboration with the Newcastle Upon Tyne hospitals.In her role, Dr Lawson works towards implementing sustainable systems within anaesthesia, encouraging doctors and hospitals to consider their environmental footprint by considering alternatives to established practices.One of the initiatives devised by the fellowship is to build the Environmental Champions Network comprised of one anaesthetist volunteer from every hospital in the UK and Ireland so that information can be shared.Dr Lawson said: ldquoWe know that people are starting to embed sustainability and sustainable projects within anaesthesia and therersquos been some really great work done and some really good ideas.ldquoWhat we hope the network will achieve is to help promote the work that people have done locally on a national scale so that people can see what projects have happened around the country and think they could do them too.Eventually, the network will be used to collect national data sets and get more information from hospitals so the fellowship can work on more concrete data and less estimates.Dr Lawson said: ldquoIf we have more accurate data we can get more accurate values of carbon foot-printing from some of our areas of practice that we know are high carbon impact.She echoes Dr Gallagher by saying that patient safety must always come first, and that will sometimes mean using less the sustainable desflurane gas.There are other initiatives being investigated that can lower emissions including recycling schemes and waste distribution. Dr Lawson said: ldquoAnaesthetics and theatres are a really resource intensive area of a hospital with lots of staff, lots of equipment, we use a lot of medication and we use a lot of water, energy and light.ldquoAs an industry, wersquore really trying to step up in terms of sustainability and looking at the products that are coming into the supply chain and in hospitals in the first place.

Foraging programmes of events will also take place across Forth Valley and Lomond, and in Fe.Throughout the festival,participants foraged for and learn about medicinal plants, how to cook with wild ingredients and indulge in feasts made from foraged food.As well as fungi hunts, hedgerow and wildflower walks, the Lanarkshire programme offeredforagers the chance to explore Kirkfieldbank Community Orchard, where more than  trees have been planted by Clyde Valley Orchards Cooperative Limited, which represents the remaining apple growers in the area.The event, according to the organisationrsquos director Duncan Arthur, who lead the walk, aimed to highlight a lost age of apple-growing and attempts to keep alive a flavour of some of the arearsquos apple industry and its social impact.The valley, he says, was once richly decorated with the sweet-smelling blossoms and fruits of countless trees.ldquoApples in Scotland go away back to Roman times when they were introduced, but their hey day was about  years ago when there was a marked increase in the land given over to orchards, he says.ldquoThey grew Victoria plums which suited area well. Scottrsquos jam-makers were in Carluke, and crops of gooseberries were used for their pectin to make strawberry jam.ldquoThere were strawberries, soft fruits, damsons, and then came plums, apples and pears.Hundreds of orchards sprung up in large estates, delivering fruit to jam producers and markets. At the dawn of the th century, there were more than  hectares of commercial orchards throughout the Clyde and Avon Valley.Growers had found the valleyrsquos sheltered slopes, well-drained soils and moderate rainfall ideal for fruit growing. While the location - handy for large areas of population ndash meant they could easily transport their stock to fruit markets and shops.However the closure of railways followed by the s arrival of supermarkets with their demands for perfect-shaped fruits, cheaper imports, changing demand for sweeter, crisper, prettier fruit, saw many orchards wither and the land go fallow.The apple industry, which as well as providing jobs and income to the area brought cultural aspects in songs, stories and art, crumbled.A recent study of  of Clyde Valleyrsquos orchards sites found just over half were still intact, covering an area of just over  hectares. But while there was still signicant fruit grown in the area, most was not used, with around ha of orchard lost or abandoned.Of the trees that remained, many were aged with most orchards found to have less than  trees remaining.However an effort by the Co-operative has led to new trees being planted in private orchards and the Kirkgatefield Community Orchard Juice from the crops is now collected and sold to help fund further planting.However, Mr Arthur adds that the notion of the area once again providing signicant input to the nationrsquos apple harvest is unlikely.ldquoOur overall objective is tothe character and environmental benefits that came with the orchards and not lose any more of what were traditional orchards to development and neglect.ldquoDferent native ieties of apples is a nice thing to have, but what is really important to the area and the environment is to have trees which support other things like pollination, bugs, fungus and mosses.According to Wendy Barrie, cook and publisher of the Scottish Food Guide, the loss of much of Scotlandrsquos apple heritage has impacted on the way we cook as well as eat.ldquoScotland was world-famous for our apples and the orchards in places like Clyde Valley as well as at Newburgh in Fe and the Carse of Gowrie between Perth and Dundee, supplied an incredible range of ieties.ldquoWhat we get the supermarkets today is poor in comparison, she says.The bountul crops found their way into countless dishes, relishes and jams which helped add flavour to Scotsrsquo plates long after the last apple had been picked.ldquoBack in days gone by we didnrsquot have lemons from Sicily to provide flavour and sharpness, and apples were an important part of cooking, she adds.ldquoThey also provided pectin as a jellying agent for jams, and there were many uses for the apples they grew.She adds: ldquoTherersquos no one answer as to why our orchards have gone. Supermarkets, world trade, we import cheap appeals from New Zealand and France, while we could be growing our own. ldquoldquoWe need to keep heritage ieties alive."},{"url":null,"title":"stephen-barclay-raises-possibility-extending-implementation-period-39-landing-zone-39-deal-sight","story":"As Boris Johnson prepares for his working lunch with Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing European Commission President, in Luxembourg today, it appears the possibility of extending the implementation period by as much as two extra years could, the UK Government believes, provide the time for the Stormont assembly to be restored and, crucially, enable local politicians to give their consent to the alternative arrangements Whitehall is proposing to the problematic backstop.ldquoA deal can be done there is a landing zone that we can see but therersquos a huge amount of work still to do, Mr Barclay told BBC Radio rsquos Pienaarrsquos Politics, noting how securing a new agreement would require ldquocreativity and flexibility on both sides.The Secretary of State pointed out howan agreement were reached by October , any changes to the UKrsquos trading relationship with the EU would ldquonot apply until the end of the implementation period, which is December  or one or two years later by mutual agreement.When he was challenged on the prospect of the transition being pushed to the end of , Mr Barclay pointed out how he was simply stating ldquowhat the legal text says, noting: ldquoThe point is there is scope for an extension but it is by mutual consent, so it would be a sovereign decision.Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, also appeared on the airwaves, pointing out how the Government was ldquoworking through the Irish border issue with the EU.ldquoThe reality is we have to deal with the backstop issue, and people said, under the Theresa May deal, that the Withdrawal Agreement would never be considered or looked at again, and neither would the political declaration.ldquoWe are in dferent territory right now, so itrsquos no point arguing about the past.

Last year, , Scottish volunteers took part, removing an incredible , inidual items of litter at  beach cleans along , metres of Scottish coastline.Data collected by volunteers from over  years of MCS-led Great British Beach Cleans has been instrumental in the introduction of Scotland’s p single-use carrier bag charge, commitments to implement a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds and to introduce a depositscheme for bottles and cans.Mr McArthur will be joining the citizen science project to help clear and survey the litter found on Echna Loch Bay, Burray on Monday, September .“Orkney has a fine tradition when it comes to ‘bag the bruck’,# says Mr McArthur.#I have been involved in such clean up efforts since I was at school in Sanday.“Of course, these days there is a greater public awareness of marine litter, and concern about the problems caused by plastic pollution in our seas.“I’m looking forward to joining volunteers of all ages at Echna Loch Bay to support the Great British Beach Clean campaign. This will be just one of many such clean ups taking place across the country. As well as helping tidy up our beaches and coastlines, I hope the initiative helps highlight the importance of reducing waste and protecting our precious marine environment”.Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer said: “It’s fantastic to see that local MSP, Liam McArthur, will be joining us at Echna Loch Bay to support our Great British Beach Clean it’s really important for decision-makers to see how much litter, especially plastic, makes its way on to our beaches. We hope that Liam’s attendance at the Great British Beach Clean will encourage local constituents to join us for an eye-opening day on the beaches of Orkney. It#s vital that we all continue to work together to stop the tide of plastic in our oceans.”Constituents looking to join Liam McArthur at the Great British Beach Clean can sign up to volunteer at: www.mcsuk.org greatbritishbeachcleancopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats. The former was cleaned out last week after contaminants were discovered inside the base of the stack, said Mr Jonermark, and the amount of bacteria used to pury the air in a filter chamber has been increased. Highland Council would be approached to seethey would agree to a -metre extension to the height of the chimney.As far as the feed boats are concerned, Mr Nilsson said the problem arises when the hatches are opened so that the fish meal can be delivered to the plant. This will occur for about  hours per year, he said, and the firm is currently working on a solution to that.Mr Jonermark added: #We do not want this to be a problem for anyone. We do not want this situation to continue.#We want to make a positive contribution to the village and we will continue to invest to make sure the problems go away. By next summer the plant should be quiet and there should be no smell.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/INVERNESS-CITY-SKYE-1-web.jpg","title":"portree high girls selected to join caley thistle","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineKatherine Dibblefrom Breakish and Jenner Macleodfrom Raasay will travel through to the Highland capital for training and competitions.Katherine Dibble can operate as a playmaker, while Jenner MacLeod plays as a defender.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

Having left school with no exams, Martin’s road to the classroom and education sector began as an engineer.“I never really thought I would be a teacher because I never had the confidence to be one,” he explained.“It was a dream in a sense but I never really thought it would be a reality.“I left secondary school with no exams. I went out into the world of work – it gives you a lot of le experiences or the real world as I call it.“I went into engineering and had several jobs. My we has a job in education and she told me about a course up in Derry that gave you access into university. I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening. With my technology background, I like a project such as a pond or a patio to keep me entertained.”As for the future, Martin is content at Mercy College but would love no more than see a new building for the school in his working le.“I am  now and I suppose you start to think about how many more years I can give in education.“I probably have another ten years in me. I am happy at Mercy College – there are so many challenges every year.“I really want to see our newbuild come for the school which is in the pipeline – just need Stormont up and running to approve it.“The future of the school is very bright. There is a lot of work still to be done to maintain our standards and results and improve facilities for the kids.“"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem.

There are other guys in Derry who are on the edge of that, the problem with this is and Declan Morgan was right, there is a human cost, a psychological cost, a physical cost.“People are getting their hopes built up thinking something is going to happen and then they’re deflated again, you can only pull yourself up so many times.“I’m having dficulty pulling myself up week by week, to continue fighting this, and it would be a hell of a lot more dficult for people who aren’t aware of the detail and the argument that goes into getting this far.”For victims it is about much more than monetary compensation, that comes secondary to an apology from the state and institutions responsible and a package that enables them to move on with their lives in a better way – which includes appropriate healthcare and support.Last Friday, Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland Sir Declan Morgan said it was \"shocking\" that victims are still awaiting action.He revealed that before Sir Anthony Harte, who chaired the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, died, he had expressed \"profound disappointment\" at the lack of progress.Sir Declan said it \"epitomises how the lack of an assembly impacts negatively on the lives of Northern Irelands citizens\".‘Absolute disgrace’The Historical Institutional Abuse Redress Bill was listed amongst parliament business on Monday but was not dealt with because of prorogation.Mr McCourt believes the suspension of parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has essentially “killed off” the Redress Bill.“To all intents and purposes the Redress Bill is killed off. If the legislation is not passed and hasn’t gone through the House of Lords and received the royal seal of approval then it is killed off.“The fact that it hasn’t been dealt with at this stage is an absolute disgrace, Declan Morgan is right to bring it back up again.“Even at this point they are still talking about it being a devolved matter, the hope of having this dealt with through the NI Assembly does not exist, the only avenue for this to go forward is through Westminster.\"Speaking at Westminster on Tuesday, Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon said she was \"extremely annoyed and disgusted\" that the motion to discuss historical abuse in NI wasnt even moved because of prorogation.\"By proroguing parliament tonight, the Prime Minister has wilfully and deliberately deprived victims of a -minute debate. He has sent out a clear signal that those victims to not even merit a debate.“It’s appalling, I ask the Secretary of State to demand that the Prime Minister comes to NI, sits at the meeting and looks the victims of HIA in the face and explains to them why he is so disrespectful and discourteous of the hurt and the suffering that they have had to endure.”Unexpected and emergency debates were to blame, Julian Smith explained, and he apologised for the change in business which he said “in no way diminishes how seriously I’m progressing the issues or affected the commitments I have made.”Mr Smith said officials have prepared the policy and lawyers the draft law and he has asked that it be included in the Queen’s speech as a matter of urgent priority.He was however challenged about why legislation hasn’t been brought forward and was told that the state is failing victims yet again.Scotland’s progressIn Scotland their inquiry is ongoing, the report is not written, but the Scottish First Minister has instructed the civil service to initiate an advanced payment scheme. Anyone over  years of age or with a terminal illness can now apply for an award of £, – which is not their full and final settlement.Some child migrants who were taken from homes in Northern Ireland and shipped off to Australia have also received payments.Mr McCourt believes the same could have been done for victims in Northern Irelandthere had been the political will to do it.The HIA inquiry studied allegations of abuse in  homes and other residential institutions between  to .These were run by the state, local authorities, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the children’s charity Barnardo’s. The largest number of complaints related to four Catholic-run homes.A report in  recommended that victims should receive compensation, however, the process of securing compensation stalled when devolution collapsed in the same week.After a four-year Inquiry and over two and a half years since the publication of the report, the government has still failed to deliver a promised apology and financial redress.In recent weeks Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, gave assurances to victims that a Redress Bill would be fast-tracked through Westminster.

Members were told that a key element of this innovation project was the provision of mechanism to support the transfer of skills and expertise to company staff and university students.Personalised MedicineIn relation to the prioritisation of the Future Fund of £m and the further anticipated match funding from NI Government and other partners, the emphasis is on advancing with projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, Council-wide, multi-skills employment pathways intervention support programme.The report advised that work on these innovation projects as well as the proposed SMART and digital city projects were advancing in close collaboration with local industry and partners and relevant government departments, while the strategic outline cases for major regeneration projects for Derry City and Strabane Town Centre are at an advanced stage of progress.The Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence intends on harnessing the power of Genomics to predict and diagnose inherited and acquired disease, and to personalise treatments and interventions.The Ulster University representatives said it will expand its partnership with Genomics Ireland and other commercial enterprises to sequence the genomes of % of NI’s population contributing to a research database that can be interrogated to develop personalised medicine solutions with worldwide application and valuable I.P. and how it will also contribute to health improvement locally through a unique ‘community buy-in’ approach.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wOVxcXC8wOTEyMTkwNlxcXC9TVFJBQkFORS1ERVZJQ0UtLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhlOTFmNGZjY2ExNDE2YjZiOGFkN2MwMzExOGY0ZWQ0NThmOWJlMmIifQ==/strabane-device.png","title":"security operation creggan area derry following discovery mortar device strabane","story":"District Commander Superintendent Gordon McCalmont said: \"It is our assessment that the New IRA is responsible for the mortar device that was discovered outside homes in Church View Close in Strabane on Saturday morning th September.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes.

He showed great promise as a soccer player, playing locally for Ballynahinch Olympic and catching the eye of Norwich City.Well-liked and respected, and much loved, Katie says that her family never realised that Mark was suffering with mental health issues.Katie said: ldquoMark was an extremely engaging young man who got an A in his  plus. We called him the brain box of the family, teasing him about going to the grammar school which after the eight of us, that was quite a novelty.ldquoOur wee manrsquos funeral was one of the largest ever seen in Ballynahinch and held on New Yearrsquos Eve. If he only knew how much he was loved. It was truly heartbreaking.ldquoWhy, why, why was our overwhelming thoughts  Before Mark died, we had rarely heard of the word suicide. Now, sadly, any of us would struggle to speak to anyone who hasnrsquot been affected in some way.ldquoMark was outwardly a happy young man, who always had a smile on his face. He was always laughing and his friends knew him as Quinny. He loved his family and friends.Katie said that Mark was buried in his Olympic strip and his jersey number  was retired by the club shortly afterwards.Ballynahinch Olympic has continued to honour Mark every year at their awards night presenting the Mark Quinn memorial cup to the young player of the year.Katie has also made a plea for those who feel le is a struggle to talk to someone.She said: ldquoIf anyone reading this is struggling, please let someone know. Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town. Ironically, Mark would have been  years old on September  a week after tournament.Former schoolmate, Conor MacNamara, spoke on behalf of the men involved in the fund-raising initiative.   He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to . Mental health awareness is something that people are much more open about these days. It has a high profile in the media too which makes it easier for people to hold up their hands and admit that they are struggling with their own mental health.ldquoIn particular, young people feel a lot of pressure from unhealthy relationships with social media.ldquoBut still, suicide is still very high in Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and other parts of the county.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I gave her a shot of adrenaline and it didn’t really do anything.“Then I gave her a second adrenaline pen and it seemed to work until the ambulance arrived.“She required two more in the ambulance but from what I’ve heard she seems to be good now, thank God.“I’m also trained as a doctor so I think that certainly helped.”He added: “It’s not the sort of thing you expect to see and I’m glad I was able to help.”Emmett, whose long term ambition is to work in anaesthesia, has been in touch with the lady’s family who expressed their gratitude for his lesaving actions: “Her daughter contacted me and said she couldn’t thank me enough.”Emmett’s family back in Lurgan have expressed their pride in the young doctor’s heroic actions.His aunt Margaret McManus said: “We are very proud of him. He lost his twin brother, Finbar, three years ago and he has worked so hard. His mum dad and granny Eilish and sister Emma are so proud of him.”Emmett said: “My family has been through a tough time, I lost my brother when I was studying for my medical degree, I couldn’t focus on my exams.

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy.
