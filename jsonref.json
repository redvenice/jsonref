Everybody has had their own problems but nobody has been hurt.\u0027 At a meeting in a school in neighbouring Chapel-en-le-Frith last night, the remaining residents were told they had to wait until after noon today before a decision could be made on whether they could go back.         Some roads in the area still remained closed today despite the fact residents were being let back into their properties after being away from them for six days Derbyshire Police previously said those evacuated from the town must wait until experts decide that reservoir\u0027s damaged dam is \u0027absolutely safe\u0027.Despite most people having to wait, representatives of the Environment Agency said the water level had dropped way below the target of around 27 feet, after around 17 per cent of the reservoir\u0027s capacity had been pumped out.  The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning covering much of England, including the Derbyshire town, on Friday and Saturday.One resident who has returned, John Lomas, said: \u0027It\u0027s great to be back home. All the services guys have done an excellent job, I\u0027m very proud of them all.\u0027Another returning resident, Melissa Broxup, said the last few days had been \u0027a nightmare, an absolute nightmare\u0027. She added: \u0027I\u0027ve not been able to go anywhere and Whaley is so quiet.

I can finally get some sleep. I just can\u0027t wait to get back in my flat. I\u0027m happy but on the other side I\u0027m gutted for those who can\u0027t come back.\u0027An RAF Chinook was again drafted in on Tuesday to help the previously dropped bags of aggregate settle into place. Residents were informed that there would be delays when returning to their homes and asked them to \u0027bear with\u0027 the emergency services who are now working to get residents back \u0027as safely and efficiently as possible\u0027.Closure in the area remain and the A5004 Buxton Road, just north of the junction of Macclesfield Road and Chapel Road, is currently closed due to urgent bridge repairs.Police also asked people to avoid entering Whaley Bridge from the south on this route until further notice. It was also advised that Marsh Lane in New Mills is also closed due to utility works.A multi-agency hub will be available later this afternoon at Whaley Bridge Primary School, 45 Buxton Road, Whaley Bridge, SK23 7HX for residents and businesses.For the next seven days there will be representatives from High Peak Borough Council, Derbyshire police, Electricity North West, Cadent Gas, United Utilities, social care, Environment Agency and mental health services.  Addressing what would happen once people are given the green light to return home, Ms Swann said all cordons would be lifted and roads would go back to normal.In the meantime, she insisted that security measures were still in force in the area after reports of burglaries and prowlers.Ms Swann said: \u0027We can assure you that security of the area continues. We are using drones regularly to patrol the area.\u0027Members of the public at the meeting were also told the dam would eventually have to be rebuilt.A spokesman for the Environment Agency said: \u0027We are very much in the emergency phase now and we are currently repairing and carrying out construction work. \u0027It is a long-term construction project, but we will not have started from scratch. It could take 18 months, two years, three years, who knows?\u0027 Police have been using drone devices to keep an eye on more that 500 empty homes and businesses and deputy constable Swann said: \u0027Officers are doing checks on a regular basis. We are monitoring what is going on.\u0027 Venton, 77 and Ellis, 64, told The Guardian that hey could not leave their two border collies, Meg and Amy after they were asked to leave their property on Saturday.The pair had been visited by rescue teams and Venton said: \u0027They said we could be affected and that they would like us to evacuate from the premises. We said we would prefer to stop here.\u0027Meg, our dog, has a bad leg after having an operation and we just couldn\u0027t leave her. We gave them all our details and they told us to listen out for a siren.\u0027This is while Ellis claimed they were not being \u0027forced to leave\u0027 and that workers had been \u0027very nice\u0027 about the whole situation.\u0027They did offer to put the dog in a car for us, but we don\u0027t have to go. They were very nice about it and they weren\u0027t forcing us, so we made the decision to stay put.

This was previously covered by an Interrail ticket.The move was met with criticism yesterday, with fears raised that tourism in cities outside of London will be affected. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the RDG had been ‘deeply irresponsible’ over the situation.Britain has been part of Interrail since its launch in 1972 and began a trial selling Eurail passes in January.                  Britain has been part of Interrail since its launch in 1972 and began a trial selling Eurail passes in January. Pictured are tweets criticising the move Unlike Interrail, which allows travel across as many as 31 countries for European citizens, Eurail is for tourists from the rest of the world.But following the trial, the RDG favoured its own ‘Britrail’ pass for those travelling to the UK from outside Europe, which includes two-for-one deals on attractions across the country.The Eurail Group subsequently ended Britain’s association with its Interrail and Eurail schemes as it intends to merge the passes.Eurostar trains will not be affected by the move, which comes into force from January next year.This means that tourists on an Interrail pass will be able to travel to London from Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam and vice versa.Rail expert Mark Smith, founder of Seat61.com, said the decision is ‘a backwards step’ as it would put visitors off from going to destinations such as Edinburgh, York and Bath.         A map showing some of the interrail routes around Europe, which are regularly used by backpackers ‘They’ll be encouraged to see London and go back and enjoy their free travel elsewhere,’ he said.‘So it’s bad news for the regions.’ Labour’s Mr McDonald added: ‘We are in the middle of a climate crisis and have just 11 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid catastrophe. We should be making it easier for people to travel between countries by rail, not encouraging flying by making rail travel more expensive and difficult.’For almost 50 years the Interrail scheme has been used as a ‘rite of passage’ by teenagers and young people, allowing them to travel freely across the continent on a single ticket.RDG director of nations and regions Robert Nisbet said: ‘The rail industry boosts British tourism and working together, rail companies are offering the best option for tourists with BritRail, which is recommended by Visit Britain, offers two for one deals on 200 attractions across the country and includes the convenience of mobile tickets.‘Although the Eurail Group has ended our decades-long membership of Interrail since we stopped trialling Eurail passes, British people will feel no difference - they can still buy an Interrail pass, get the Eurostar and travel by train across Europe.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Grieving parents urge Wayne Rooney reverse crass deal 32Red betting firm","story":"Share this articleSuicide | Gambling with Lives"},{"url":null,"title":"P O Cruises cancels Dubai Gulf voyages amid Iran tensions","story":"Share this article          Iran\u0027s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) seized the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero (pictured) on July 19 for alleged marine violationsAn insider said: \u0027There are a lot of people that are going to be affected by this decision.\u0027In one meeting, it was made clear that executives at the top had cold feet, and had decided to cancel the voyages around the Arabian Gulf because of tensions.\u0027They specifically cited the Iran crisis as the cause of the cancellation.\u0027Then circulars were sent round, letting more people know that thousands of customers\u0027 holidays next season would be refunded or compensated in some way.\u0027P\u0026ampO are planning to send Oceana around the Canaries instead.\u0027We were also told that a lot of guests would be calling, so managers emailed round to say that they needed dozens of volunteers to answer calls over the weekend.\u0027The Contact Centre will need a lot of hand, or that\u0027s what they\u0027re preparing for.\u0027It\u0027s a popular holiday for P\u0026ampO enthusiasts.

It looks like the wizard has been up to his old tricks, conjuring a gossamer-thin bridge that effortlessly s the chasm, reconnecting the mainland to the ancient ruins of Tintagel Castle for the first time in centuries.The modern-day Merlins take the form of Laurent Ney, a Belgian architect and engineer, and William Matthews, lead designer under Renzo Piano of the Shard skyscraper in London. The pair teamed up to summon this £5m footbridge into being for English Heritage. “We had no magic spells to help us,” says Ney, whose firm has built around 100 bridges across the world, but none in such a challenging location. “It was the first time in my life that I had to design a bridge in a site that was totally inaccessible – and which was expected to disappear into the landscape.”The rugged promontory provided the perfect place for the Cornish kings to build their fortified stronghold in the fifth and sixth centuries, when the headland was connected by a narrow isthmus that has since crumbled into the sea. The end-of-the-earth feeling also helped to fuel all the legends that have swirled around the site since the middle ages, when it was named as the place of King Arthur’s conception, prompting Richard Earl of Cornwall to build his castle there in the 13th century. This made it a tricky place to bring 50 tonnes of steel and 40,000 slate tiles – all of which had to be delivered by helicopter in five-tonne prefabricated chunks and assembled by a crane on a cable stretching right across the gulch.The result is a miraculously slight structure, with polished steel balustrades and diagonal braces that, from a distance, make it shimmer like a spider’s web in the dew. As you get closer, it reveals itself to be two separate structures, each cantilevered out from the cliffs – like a pair of opposing ing boards, not quite meeting in the middle. The gap, say the architects, represents “the transition between present and the past, the known and the unknown, reality and legend” – to be experienced as visitors cross from the mainland to the mysterious ruins.In truth, it was a practical necessity, in order to avoid excessive forces meeting at the centre of the double-arched structure, but it makes for a poetic sight. Daredevils hoping for a risky leap across the ravine will be disappointed, though: the gap is only 4cm wide and the two decks are actually connected by steel cables at either side, somewhat destroying the illusion.There has been a need for a bridge here for a long time. Ever since the 12th-century chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth spun his seductive Arthurian tales, Tintagel has been inundated with visitors seeking a taste of the magic. Accessibility has never been its strong point. The original land bridge to the island was so slight, wrote Geoffrey, that “three men shall be able to defend against the whole power of the kingdom”. When the poet John Leland visited in 1540, he observed that the only way on to the island was “by longe elme trees layde for a bryge”, while a 1604 map labels “a draw bridge decaid” and shows a man in a red tunic struggling to scale the “verie steepe and craggie” cliffs.He was lucky there was no one with a buggy and screaming toddlers trying to come down in the other direction. As one of English Heritage’s top five attractions, Tintagel Castle sees almost 250,000 visitors a year, with up to 3,000 people a day at the height of summer. Before the new bridge, the only way to the ruins was via steep staircases cut into the cliffs, connected by a small wooden bridge at the bottom.“It was always a nightmare getting people on and off the island,” says Georgia Butters, English Heritage’s head of historic properties in Cornwall. At peak times, there were waits of up to 45 minutes at either side, with school groups and pensioners regularly stranded on the protected promontory with no loos in sight. She says around a third of visitors to the small village of Tintagel didn’t even bother visiting the castle, put off by the long queues and 148 steps.Now, with timed tickets in hand, tourists will be able to flow across the bridge’s elegant 70 metre deck of local slate tiles, which have been packed together on their sides without mortar, creating the effect of walking across a box of After Eight mints. There is a slight rattle as you traverse this mineral mat, and a subtle bounce created by fellow walkers, both of which add a frisson to crossing the 2.5-metre-wide deck 60 metres above the sea. There are nice details – thin slices of quartz embedded in the slate as well as raw oak handrails – giving it a hand-crafted quality in tune with the historic setting, and making it unlike most modern technocratic footbridges.The polished steel balustrade can look a bit too bling as it glints in the sun, and the arrival of this shiny new structure hasn’t been to everyone’s liking. To some, it smacks of the “Disneyfication” of the site in the hands of English Heritage, which has been accused of turning the location into a “cash cow theme park” by campaign group Kernow Matters To Us (Kernow is Cornish for Cornwall). Hackles were raised in 2016 when an 8ft high bronze statue of a cloaked figure with a sword was unveiled on the island, shortly after a relief of Merlin’s face was sculpted into the cliffs below – an unthinkable act in the eyes of some critics, akin to carving the face of a druid into Stonehenge.“The bridge is just the latest English Heritage vanity project,” says Cornish archaeologist and historian Craig Weatherhill. “It continues the cheap and nasty theme park approach, ruining the ambience of the site.” Weatherhill and his fellow campaigners think the focus on Arthurian legend is a distraction from the real history of Tintagel, the seat of the kings of Dumnonia, a powerful empire that stretched across Cornwall and Devon from the 5th to the 7th centuries. The number of amphora fragments found at the site, indicating vast quantities of wine and olive oil brought from across the Mediterranean, far exceeds the number found at sites across the rest of Britain combined, while excavations suggest Tintagel was larger than London in the same period. “What really rankles Cornish people,” adds Weatherhill, “is the fact they’re marketing the site as ‘English’ Heritage, when the English have had nothing to do with it.”Butters defends the accusations of commercialisation, which have been more vocally levelled at English Heritage since it became an independent charity in 2014 and forced to cover its own costs (the bridge was part-funded by a £2.5m donation from Tetra Pak billionaires Hans and Julia Rausing). A family ticket to Tintagel now costs £33.80, while the gift shop sells a Sword in the Stone letter-opener for £40 and a model of the Knights of the Round Table for £120.“We need to make money to look after our heritage,” says Butters. “And it’s very important that we’re not snobbish and elitist about it. We must spark the interest of the next generation in these sites, because if people don’t care about them, they won’t be preserved.”You could argue that there has been a slightly tacky side to Tintagel ever since Tennyson fuelled the Arthurian hype with his Idylls of the King, and the railway arrived at nearby Camelford, spawning such heady visions as the Victorian pile of the Camelot Castle Hotel and the 1930s fantasy of King Arthur’s Great Halls. Amid the surrounding jamboree of legends, the sleek new bridge is a carefully judged arrival."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/341085f9d8ec257dced80f0902f1b8cff3c75e71/0_581_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36323f07568f76c9f3538b9271186805","title":"mark mawston best photograph yoko ono","story":"‘She came on stage with a black silk bag over her head and walked straight into the mic stand. It didn’t ruin anything though. The crowd were in rapturesI took this shot of Yoko Ono 14 years ago, in 2005 at Patti Smith’s Meltdown, the London festival curated by a different musical icon each year. I’ve always been fascinated by Yoko Ono because of the mythos that surrounds her. She’s often referred to as the woman who split up the Beatles, but there’s so much more to her than that.When I saw her on the lineup I was surprised – she seemed an odd choice. But she is indisputably one of the strongest women in the music industry, she has such a unique sound. When I saw her name, I had to go.That festival was one of the best Meltdowns there has ever been, and Ono’s performance was electrifying. I was perched right in front of centre stage and the anticipation was palpable. The audience was full of different people: lifelong fans, Beatles obsessives, a newer avant garde crowd and a load of celebrities too. As we waited I felt like I was in church – the reverence the crowd had for her was overwhelming.The lights went down and a short film was projected on to a silk screen hanging across the stage. It was transfixing. In one scene, a person walks towards the camera, getting closer and closer, and then at a certain point, the figure in the film became real, on stage, in front of us. Yoko had a slit made in the screen which she came through at the very moment that the figure in the projection was the right size, so it looked like art made life. Everyone was completely taken aback.At the time, she was still interested in bagism – a practice she and Lennon engaged in as a way to deinidualise speakers and emphasise their message by wearing a nondescript bag over their heads. So she came out with this black silk bag obscuring her vision, and walked straight into the mic stand. It didn’t ruin anything though. The crowd were in raptures.In a split second when I managed to take my eyes off her, I realised that Sean Lennon, her and John’s son, was standing in the background bathed in red light. It was utterly spooky. He was the absolute spit of his father, wearing the same glasses with long hair – it was like a vision on stage.I was so transfixed that I almost missed this shot. Only when I took my eyes off Sean did I see Yoko directly above me, leaning over the stage with the power and energy you can see in the photo. I had one chance, and I managed to get the shot.The photo made an impact: it was the photograph that got me working with the Rock Archives, countless people have messaged me about it, and I believe Yoko herself bought a copy. But it’s funny, because I don’t necessarily rate it as one of my best. I think that’s a quirk of photographers: the work they really rate isn’t often the one that resonates with people the most.But I think the image speaks to her power. At the time of this performance, she was around 71, and she’s small. But she should never be underestimated: when she speaks, people listen. When she performs, people watch. You can feel her presence. I think it’s what makes her such an icon.Influences: ‘William Claxton, Linda McCartney, Mick Rock, Annie Leibovitz. The first images that made me want to pick up a camera though were shots of reflections in a glass building that my grandfather took in Newcastle.’ High point: ‘Being one of the first music photographers to give a talk at the O2’s British Music Experience along with Jill Furmanovskyand Phillip “Mr Sixties” Townsend. ’Low point: ‘Meeting an out-of-sorts Sean Connery. However, I did walk away with a wonderful piece of advice: “If you’re gonna be schmaartt, be shmaarrttaa” and he’s still a hero of mine.’Top tip: ‘Even if you’re in a crowd in the pit in front of stage, try and do something different. Do what you’re not supposed to and enjoy every moment.’• Nile Rodgers’ Meltdown festival is at the Southbank Centre, London, until 11 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b3396f872405aed9ba0a1877a7f889642a3173d/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4c07695f4552cbaf82903dad51d0c1f9 1320w","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“It’s Mark Twain these days,” says voicefrombelgrade, “I’m rereading his short story collection”:Every time I read The Experience Of The McWilliamses With Membranous Croup, Extracts from Adam’s Diary, Eve’s Diary, The Stolen White Elephant... I just love them. Also, I pilfered Tom Sawyer from my late father’s library (all right, I’ll take it back, my mom won’t even know that I took it...) – it’s a masterful Serbian translation from the 1949 (the author is Stanislav Vinaver). It’s relatively rare to find a translation that’s as good as the original, but this one really is, and I just have to revisit it every so often.BaddHamster is “finishing up” The House Of Sleep by Jonathan Coe:Warm, funny, breezily paced (as always with him) and a few interesting thoughts on the nature of sleep. Basically, if you like Coe, you’ll probably enjoy it. I do and I am.And CharlieBing “just finished” Judith Schalansky’s Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands:As a cartographer by training and a sometime graphic artist by trade, I just loved almost every bit of this beautifully designed book ... a minor quibble with the occasional use of yellow text on white pages, but the typography is exquisite, the whole conceit just wonderful.Michael, a retired headmaster grieving for his wife, the victim of a terrorist attack, asks himself the question of who is really responsible for what happened, not the bombers themselves, not the bomb makers, but the ‘bomb-triggerers’ – the politician enriching himself from his time in office. There’s much more to this story than vengeance though the narration soon reveals darker aspects of Michael’s character as he recalls his career. Good’s skill is in the narrator considering himself as a realist struggling with difficult pupils, but coming over to the reader as anything but that, and a cruel authoritarian.As an ex-teacher of 31 years, this is an admirably accurate portrayal of some headteacher’s traits I have seen all too frequently.Reading Isabel Allende’s Daughter Of Fortune has been “an exquisite pleasure” for PatLux:Such a rich historical novel in which I, like one of the main protagonists Tao Chi’en, learned lots. I loved the lyrical evocative prose which stimulated all my senses. One of those books that makes you feel you are on a delightful journey with the characters and evokes laughter and sadness. And it stays with you in the intervals between when you put it down and pick it up again. I will definitely be reading more Allende.MachenBach recommends Augustus Carp, Esq., By Himself: Being the Autobiography of a Really Good Man:A satirical mock-autobiography, published anonymously by Sir Henry Howarth Bashford in 1924. Anthony Burgess singled it out as one of the 20th century’s funniest books, but I would say that it’s consistently amusing, rather than LOL funny. Still, that’s rare enough to be noteworthy. Carp is possessed of a Pooterishly inflated sense of his own (and his father’s) importance, and almost total blindness to his own limitations and motivations. He’s a hilariously sanctimonious self-professed Christian (or “Xtian”), who frequently goes out into the streets to lecture smokers, drinkers and music hall artistes on the evils of their ways, but who seems hypocritically blind to his own acts of bullying, blackmail, and greed. Like a monstrous cross between Pooter and Ignatius J Reilly, his voice is impressively realised, and the irony well sustained. I’m not sure how much real satirical bite it had at the time – it seems rather more 1890s than 1920s in many ways, and the joke does wear a little thin long before he gets his comeuppance, but it’s very well-written (in a pretentiously archaic register) and generally good fun.Finally, Dennis89 suggests we give “serious thought” to reading An Armenian Sketchbook by Vasily Grossman:A 200-page account detailing the writer’s reflections, thoughts and wanderings during his visit to Armenia at the twilight of his life. Justification for the journey is provided by the task of editing a Russian translation of a local Armenian novel though the trip allows Grossman to explore and delve far more deeply into this marginalised and often overlooked country.Faith, patriotism, oppression, comradeship and other such topics are beautifully mused upon in this life-affirming gem of a book.Sounds fantastic. (That’s also an excellent excuse to link to Linda Grant’s fine article on reading Grossman: “It took me three weeks to read it and three weeks to recover from the experience.”)If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Oyak, whose representatives have visited the Scunthorpe steelworks to see its operations, is the largest shareholder in the Turkish steelmaker Erdemir.The Labour MP Anna Turley, whose constituency included the Redcar steelworks which closed in 2015, said: “I asked for assurances that the whole company will be kept together without cherrypicking.“The secretary of state and EY confirmed this is still the priority. Everyone is working flat out to progress the sale to the next stage. Optimism that this can be achieved soon remains high.”The pace of talks has accelerated in recent weeks amid pressure from lenders to the business, whose operations have been funded by the government while talks continue. If the company had collapsed, the government would have had first call on any money that could be retrieved, limiting the extent of creditor refunds.A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “This government will leave no stone unturned to get a good solution for British Steel at Scunthorpe, Skinningrove and on Teesside.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b91ca2b9ab9f97517931f90d69bb9b12d8a3fd9d/0_317_4749_2849/master/4749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c71af98f3ef25f0c0008ad9e22868caf","title":"drop sterling pound no deal brexit","story":"The threat of a no-deal Brexit has sent the pound plummeting.

Over the past three years, politics has been increasingly blind to the concerns of ordinary people. The Brexit debate is stuck on abstract constitutional issues such as the backstop. While they are important matters, the relentless focus of public discourse on them means that we are in danger of forgetting about the lives of real people. Westminster is gripped by a fanatical race towards a cliff-edge Brexit and nobody is stopping to think about the impact it would have on the everyday lives of the people we serve as politicians.We cannot dismiss this as a trivial bump in the road. This matters, because a no-deal Brexit is now the number one threat to the value of our currency, a fundamental factor driving this nation’s prosperity. And as Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, put it, a fall in the pound “makes those of us whose earnings or savings or investment income is in pounds poorer. Period.” We simply cannot ignore the impact this is having on people in our country.August is the most popular month for Brits to go on holiday. This month, some 6 million people will go on a trip to a eurozone destination, during which they will spend an average of £574 per head, according to the Office for National Statistics. Whereas before the referendum, that would have bought a UK holidaymaker €740 on the continent, now the same spend is worth only €620. In other words, our politicians’ dangerous no-deal Brexit musings have cost travellers more than £100 per person already.Supermarket prices are also likely to be affected. Much of what we buy relies on products from the EU – purchases that British importers make in euros. A simple look at UN trade data of what we import from the eurozone reveals that the plummeting pound has already meant an increased import cost each year of £200m on French wines, £50m on fruit from Spain, and £40m on chocolates from Belgium.This is a real and present shock to UK businesses. But most importantly, it is consumers who will likely end up paying the price for this. Increased costs in imports for products will be passed on to customers. That means higher prices in the shops.The sheer drop in sterling since 2016 is only a taste of what’s to come if we continue down the destructive route of a no-deal Brexit. Instead of continuing the ideological race to the cliff edge, we have a duty to consider the interests of ordinary people. Leaving people worse off financially is a Brexit outcome nobody supports, whether they voted leave or remain.That is why it is time to think again. A fresh democratic mandate is key to this big decision, now that the circumstances have changed so much. This is why we must hand the choice back to the British people in a referendum.• Sam Gyimah is the Conservative MP for East Surrey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c3fee871d994db50846afb77fc01100a1c92dc7/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e0dbfccdc196d4331ecc54a879393b0","title":"young people parental home live ons","story":"The ONS figures need not be a cause for alarm – there are many positive reasons to stay on in the parental homeThe self-styled “jilted generation” have a new argument to boost their case against their elders. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, a quarter of those between the ages of 20 and 34 were still living in the family home in 2018. That is 1 million more than 15 years ago 3.4 million people, compared with 2.4 million in 2003.And the reason is obvious, is it not? Soaring prices and an acute housing shortage (factors not unconnected) have locked young people out of the housing market, leaving high-priced private renting or the parental home as the unpalatable only options. A whole generation is being “infantilised” by the failure of successive governments to build enough homes.Well, maybe – and maybe not. In one way, the UK may just be starting to conform to the long-standing pattern in the rest of Europe. Until recently, the UK was exceptional in how early young people left home and – in more recent years – the age at which they entered the housing market.Far more school-leavers in France, Germany and elsewhere in Europe still go on to higher education in or near their home towns than in Britain, and live at home while they do so. The trend for so many 18-year-olds to go away to college here was considered strange – practically, economically and emotionally – by many on the continent.So, too, was the widespread acceptance in the UK that this was the major break: having left home for university, most young Britons did not return home. They (we) flat-shared for a few years in the big city before setting up homes of our own – entering relationships, renting or buying a place together – and so on.The age at which many Britons bought, were able to buy, or thought they should be able to buy their own home is also exceptional by European standards. In fact, the relative ease with which young people – in their early 20s, say – did so was exceptional here, too. Though it is now treated as an unattainable “norm” by many, buying a home in your 20s is a phenomenon largely limited to the 1990s to early 2000s, when zero deposits and generally loose credit made that possible (contributing to the 2008 financial crash).In fact, the whole concept of the “housing ladder” is alien to much of Europe, where renting – in a stable and secure rental market – is common until much later in life until, say, the family home is passed down or sold. It could well be argued that it is the considerable defects of our rental market rather than not being able to buy a home in your 20s that is the bigger problem in the UK. That around half of all young people now go into higher education rather than directly into a job may also be a factor in the greater numbers staying, or returning to live, at home.But there is another reason why more young people may be staying in their parental home longer, and this is that, for many, the parental home is a far more congenial a place to be than it would have been for previous generations. Since the 1960s and 70s, the huge gap in attitudes that used to exist between parents and their offspring has generally narrowed. Many children have had their own room, and a measure of privacy and independence is assumed in a way it used not to be.Plus, housing standards (for all the cramped nature of much new housing today) have improved: given the choice between a centrally heated home with access to the kitchen and a shared house with queues for the bathroom where the landlord won’t fix the boiler and damp seeps through the ceiling, which would you choose? There is more of a give-and-take now that can benefit both sides.Yes, leaving home later may delay the process of fully “growing up”. The phenomenon of spoilt young Italian men who prefer the cocoon that mama can provide to family responsibilities of their own is well known. And there may be an echo of that here: there is a big discrepancy between the number of men (2.1 million) and women (1.3 million) who are living with their parents.But is it really so bad if more people are delaying independent living because they are spending longer in education, or because they want to live a bit before settling down, or because their family home, in terms of support, creature comforts and cost, is actually quite an acceptable place to be? Perhaps there was a time, in the not too distant past, when young Britons were expected to fly the nest too soon.• Mary Dejevsky is a writer and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ceed7195f7d2a41d35de233cdf45db1842a1ce2/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=324326e8d7023a19f2c6a4c6e7b3178a","title":"why are more women than ever applying to be miss england in the age of instagram","story":"Despite widespread derision of beauty pageants – and the potential to become a model or influencer through social media – applications have risen to 20,000, as aspiring contestants attempt to show a more modern side to the faded glamour contestOn a humid July night in Newcastle upon Tyne, the launch party for Miss England 2019 is under way. In an unassuming grey-brick hotel, tucked away behind a multi-storey car park, the 52 finalists have gathered in their evening gowns, artificial silk sashes draped over their shoulders to display which region they represent and identifying numbers strapped to their wrists. The atmosphere is not unlike a high-school prom – nervous boyfriends lurk outside the banqueting hall clutching makeup cases, parents roam the hallways eager to catch a glimpse of their daughters and the finalists are always aware of the judges scattered throughout the room.Established in 1928, Miss England is the UK’s longest-running beauty pageant, although some would argue pageantry has an even longer history in Britain, with its roots in choosing May Queens for traditional May Day celebrations. Today, however, such competitions are often the focus of mockery and criticism – from the allegations of racism and bullying at Tonga’s July pageant to the car-crash reality-show portrayals such as Toddlers and Tiaras or Sandra Bullock’s turn in Miss Congeniality. Despite that, and the fact that the traditional spoils for the contestants – a modelling career and public profile – could arguably be more easily acheived in 2019 via a carefully curated Instagram feed, or reality show, somehow, beauty pageants are flourishing. Applications to compete in Miss England have been rising – reaching more than 20,000 this year.In the age of social-media influencers, what is the enduring appeal for these 16- to 27-year-olds across the country?“Pageants aren’t something I ever thought I’d be a part of,” says finalist Aysha Khan. “I used to think it was all about appearances, but last September, I saw posts online and realised it was more about community.” Motivated by the competition’s charitable focus – contestants must raise as much money as possible for their chosen organisations (this year it is the suicide prevention charity Papyrus) to take part – Khan decided to compete in her local Miss Lancashire – and won.“I live in Blackburn and I’ve worked on projects to help my local Muslim community there since I was 12,” she says. “It might seem strange to use a beauty pageant to raise awareness for community issues, but it’s such a big platform I thought it was worth a try and that I might have some fun while I’m at it.” Khan attracted attention when she entered the optional swimwear round in a wetsuit. “I didn’t want to change myself to compete,” she says. “This isn’t a field that many Asians go into, so I want to spread the right message and change people’s perspectives. I wanted to show people a different side to pageants, that it’s about personality and character.”There has been some backlash from religious groups who inisist Khan’s appearance in the competition is indecent, but she is determined to continue. “Miss England is the chance to become a role model and lead the next generation of young women by example,” she says.It is this that sets beauty queens apart from social media stars, argues the finalist and junior doctor Bhasha Mukherjee. “You’re representing a brand if you’re an influencer, whereas here, you’re representing your country. The pageant is about being a person of the world so much more than just yourself. It really humbles your ego.”Talk to anyone involved in beauty pageants these days and this is the theme: pageants are not about beauty but “character and personality”, “charity” and, crucially of course, “empowerment”. It is a modern defence against the criticism levelled at competitions since 1968, when the burgeoning Women’s Liberation Movement targeted the Miss America final. The women threw anything that represented the physical oppression of women into a “freedom trash can” (famously misrepresented as “bra burning”) to show how beauty standards oppress women. In 1970, there were similar protests against Miss World in London. The journalist and activist Joan Smith was sent to cover local beauty pageants in Lancashire in the early 70s while working as a junior reporter. “I thought it was pure anachronism, even then,” she says. “These pageants directly exploit the idea that appearances are the most important thing for women.” Despite their socially conscious rebranding, she still believes they are a deeply damaging presence. “Pageants feed on the perpetual anxieties of young women and their longevity only proves that there’s always money to be made from exploiting women,” she says. “They promote a very old-fashioned standard of beauty – with most winners being white or blond.”The lack of ersity in pageantry has long been a criticism of the industry with competitions such as Miss Black and Beautiful, which represented the Caribbean diaspora in England in the 1970s, having all but disappeared now. Leah Prescod, a former pageant competitor, set up Miss British Beauty Curve in 2012 for women over a size 14, in which more than 200 contestants have competed. “I wanted to create a space where women who don’t think they fit the mould of a beauty queen could compete,” she says. “It might seem strange to use a competitive environment to build confidence, but sometimes getting on stage and out of your comfort zone is the only way to realise your inner strength.”Unlike Miss England, which made the infamous swimsuit round offstage and optional in 2010, Prescod’s pageant encourages swimsuits. “We have all ages from 18 to people in their 60s competing. We want them to feel good about themselves,” she says. “Lots of the girls have never worn a bikini before, let alone in public, so it’s not easy to get up and do it, but they find it really rewarding and they gain a lot of respect for one another in the process.”Kat Henry, the 35-year-old winner of Miss British Beauty Curve 2015, agrees. “It was the first time I’d been so open and exposed. I wore things which I never would have done normally,” she says. “It made me realise I have the same right as anyone else to be up on that stage. Beauty isn’t all there is to a pageant – it’s about women empowering other women.”Confidence-building may be a recurring theme , but aligning inidual confidence with the idea that being rated in a pageant is somehow empowering for women in general may seem a stretch. Pratishtha Raut, 26, had anxiety issues at university and reached crisis point in her final year when she didn’t leave her house for 29 days. “I didn’t know what was happening to me because I was brought up thinking mental health was for ‘crazy’ people,” she says. “After seeking help and getting better, it has been a passion of mine to advocate for better mental health, especially among my Nepalese community. That’s why I was drawn to compete in Miss England, because their chosen charity this year is Papyrus.”Raut has raised more than £9,000 and says the competition has also unexpectedly brought her closer to her parents. “In Nepal, modelling isn’t classified as a real job and so my parents pushed me to focus on my career,” she says. “But going through this process has showed them that this could also be an option for me, along with the charity advocacy. They’re actually more into it than me because they’re so competitive – all they talk about is Miss England.”Yet the seedier side of pageantry can be a problem. The 1980s kitsch aesthetic is cloyingly persistant – visible in the sequins, sashes and tiaras that bring to mind the televised Miss Universe pageants (at one time, the rights to which were owned by Donald Trump). Here, women would be paraded on stage in only a bikini and heels, their “vital statistics” read out to the mainly white and male audience. And there is also the question of money. While Miss England is free to enter, contestants speak of competitions where entrance fees can be up to £1,000 in a pay-to-win scenario. There is also the cost of buying ball gowns, haircare, makeup and transport, although the majority of finalists have local sponsors.“Anyone can buy the license to put on a pageant from the patent office,” says the director of Miss England, Angie Beasley. “There are a lot of new competitions coming up – people are just buying titles and buying their way into national finals.” For Beasley, the appeal of Miss England isn’t just about history or a formalised judging process. “Miss England is something for the girls to aspire to be – it’s not the perfection of social media accounts, it’s showing your humanity and beliefs within a competitive setting.”Beasley points to the fact there is a Mr England competition to counter to the idea that such pageants objectify women. The men’s pageant runs once every two years and attracts a fraction of the applications of its female counterpart. Mr England 2013, Jordan Williams, is hosting Miss England’s live social-media coverage of the final and says competitors are looking for “a bit of fun, to meet other people and to raise money for charity. And if it’s objectifying to women, it’s objectifying to me, then, because I’ve been a part of it.”Of course, a men’s competition only shows that men can be objectified too – however willingly they submit to it. Finalist Mukherjee, however, has a slightly different argument. “Women get objectified wherever we go,” she says. “So why not use it to our advantage? If people are going to look at us because you’re beautiful, why not use it to push forward a positive, charitable message?” Surely there are easier ways to get your message across? “The glamour world is glamorous at the top and filthy when you get into it. At the same time, medicine is de-glam from the outside but beautiful on the inside. You need both in life,” she says. “You have to look for the positives and use what you’re given.”If beauty pageants are now so anti-beauty and pro-social change, why not change their name and change their format? “You can’t just throw away this history,” says 2015 Miss England winner Natasha Hemmings. “We are changing with the times and, ultimately, it’s such an honour to represent your country at Miss World – it’s no different from the Olympics or any other elite achievement.”Back in the banqueting suite, where floor-to-ceiling metallic curtains are shimmering and fallen sequins are crushed underfoot on the pearl-white catwalk, it is Mukherjee who is crowned Miss England 2019. There follows the inevitable burst of confetti, tears and tiaras. Millie Mae Margetts counts this as her fourth loss, but is undeterred. “I’ve got the bug – I look forward to it every year and it’s become such a passion of mine,” she says.Meanwhile, Mukherjee is starting her new hospital rotation in the morning and looking forward to Miss World next year. “This is where the real work begins,” she says. “Being a doctor is the same as being Miss England, because they’re both about being a role model and an ambassador for good causes. I can’t wait to get started.”For the other contestants, the long ride home awaits until the whole process to begin again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0de8d4cf9e6d50e81f661ab0959b20ec4c691a2/0_0_1062_637/master/1062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a1723b78c85dde5f10996d077378628","title":"sequins and stardom the fashion legacy of the supremes","story":"From homemade dresses to glittering gowns, Motown’s most successful act became well known for their iconic stage attire.

But which film spin-offs delivered, and which were cynical cash-ins?For the uninitiated, a Bratz doll is a Barbie doll without any of the intellectual heft. Accordingly, Bratz: The Movie is what Mean Girls would have been if everyone gave the impression of being there against their will. A terrible, miserable, cynical film that would have exploded if it had contained a single original idea.Not to be confused with the 2017 movie of the same name or the myriad straight-to-video sequels, My Little Pony: The Movie rode the mid-80s wave of animated toy films that also brought us The Care Bears Movie and Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw (more of which later). In this film, the ponies are forced to band together to save their land from a sentient purple gunk with a song called Nothing Can Stop the Smooze, which sounds exactly like what dying must feel like.Again, not to be confused with the animated TV series, this reimagining starred the likes of Thora Birch, Jeremy Irons and one of the guys who played Jimmy Olsen in The New Adventures of Superman. The 39th worst film of all time, according to a reader poll in Empire magazine a decade ago, it hasn’t improved with age.I’m including this in the list partly because it is loosely based on a Tamagotchi competitor, and partly because it’s terrible. Flung together with little attention paid to tone, plot or continuity, it was released to cash in on a fad while there was money to be made. To make matters worse, the soundtrack contains a song by the Barenaked Ladies.Once a concussed-looking, moss-haired dullard with no genitals and shifty eyes, the classic action figure was reimagined in GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra as a film you already forgot existed. Channing Tatum was in it, Joseph Gordon-Levitt was in it, Sienna Miller was in it, but even they couldn’t scrape together anything worth remembering.The world’s dullest board game becomes the world’s most pointless film. The game didn’t feature aliens. It didn’t feature Rihanna. It didn’t feature a ship insulting the laws of physics by doing a handbrake turn in the middle of the ocean. But the film did. Oh boy, the film did.Rainbow Brite is a yellow-haired doll who wears colourful clothes. However, for some reason, she is also the owner of one of the most convoluted mythologies in toy history. She is originally a girl called Wisp tasked with bringing colour to a grey world by locating a magical sphere. There’s a magic belt and some Colour Children, and they’re all in charge of a different colour or something. And there’s a horse and a robot horse. And this film is absolutely not worth watching.Pound Puppies were toys that looked like dogs, but in the toy-film boom of the 1980s, that was apparently enough to warrant a movie. Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw operates on the berserk assumption that the children of 1988 wanted nothing more than to watch a bunch of cartoon dogs perform pastiches of 30-year-old rock’n’roll standards. It is the lowest-grossing toy-based film ever theatrically released.Are Trolls even toys? Aren’t they just pencil toppers, or ornaments designed for murderers to collect? Whatever, they made a Trolls film, and it doubled as a jukebox musical for songs that deserved much better than to end up in a forgettable-to-annoying animated Justin Timberlake vehicle. Even my four-year-old hates this, and he’s four, for the love of God.I know what you’re thinking: “But Transformers is terrible. Every Transformers film has been an incomprehensible, overlong mishmash of damp mythology, impenetrable battle sequences and scene after scene where the camera uncomfortably leers over the bodies of young women. The Transformers series is utterly and unforgivably without any merit whatsoever. Why the hell is it all the way up at No 10?” My answer is this: I agree, but cut me a break. I’m dying here.You thought GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra was forgettable? Guess what – they made a sequel, and it was even more forgettable. Do you remember GI Joe: Retaliation? Do you remember that London got completely levelled in it? Do you remember that Bruce Willis plays General Colton, who was actually the first ever GI Joe figure back in the 60s? Do you remember that the lead actor was the goddamn Rock? No, me neither.Jem is the singer in a band. Her best friend is a “holographic computer” called Synergy. This is the most 1980s premise for a toy ever, so of course it makes perfect sense that it wasn’t turned into a film until 2015. The resulting movie had the worst opening of the year and the worst opening ever for a film released by a major studio. Universal pulled it from screens after a fortnight, and the director claimed to have received death threats. So why is it all the way up at No 8? Like I said, all these films are terrible. I really can’t reiterate that enough.You probably have the Care Bears to blame for this whole films-based-on-toys nightmare. The Care Bears Movie – about a group of bears who live on a cloud and hypnotise the depressed into being happy or something – contained original plot-specific songs by Carole King and made its money back 16 times over. And you know what? It’s quite good. Sue me.Lego Batman was the breakout star of The Lego Movie, thanks to the hilarious way he communicated that he was a depressed orphan. He was given a spin-off as a result and, while it never quite hit the heights of The Lego Movie, it was still the best Batman film in about a decade.Board games tend not to translate very well to the big screen (see Battleship), but Clue just about managed to buck the trend. Clue took Cluedo and turned it into a work of high farce, with the likes of Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn and Lesley Ann Warren yucking it up for all they were worth. Three endings were shot for this film, each declaring a different murderer if you saw it in a cinema, the ending was chosen at random. If you watch it now, you get to watch all three in a row, which is very confusing if it’s on TV in 1992, and you’re a helpless child.Oh sure, it’s flawed. Oh sure, it grabs all the fun intergalactic action of the cartoon and transplants it to dreary old mid-80s US. Oh sure, it invented the abomination that was Gwildor because Orko was too difficult to get right on-screen. And the plot revolves too heavily around synthesisers. And it contains the single most generic James Tolkan role ever committed to screen. But you know what? Frank Langella was one hell of a Skeletor. I will die on this hill.When it was first announced, The Lego Movie seemed like an act of pure craven greed. So what an amazing surprise to discover that The Lego Movie was an incredible vehicle for the toy – show me a more tactile-looking animation and I’ll eat my hat – and a sly critique of the toy’s biggest fans. For what is Will Ferrell’s Lord Business if not an uptight, overwrought, order-obsessed Lego fanatic? This film could have been No 1, had all the sequels and spin-offs not diluted its punchy appeal.I know what you’re thinking: “But didn’t you already do Transformers?” And, yes, I did, but only the Michael Bay live-action horror-shows. The animated Transformers movie, by comparison, is a masterpiece. This is the film, remember, that had an incredibly child-unfriendly soundtrack. This is the film in which Orson Welles played a robot who could turn into a planet. This is the film where – spoiler alert – Optimus Prime was murdered in the first act. Did nobody think of the toy sales?Based on a 1962 trading card series, Mars Attacks! is Tim Burton at his absolute giddiest. Gone was the creeping melancholy of Edward Scissorhands. Still to come was his descent into Disney yes-man. And here, right in the middle, is a silly, goofy, star-filled pastiche of whatever Burton felt like pastiching on any given day. At the time, it was his worst-reviewed film to that point, but to watch it now is to see a sense of aggressive playfulness you just don’t often get to witness.

There’s even provision for Keanu Reeves’s Neo to be brought back with a new face, Doctor Who style, as 2003’s Matrix Reloaded revealed the existence of umpteen previous digital messiahs, all going by the same name, before the latest iteration arrived on the scene to bullet-time the machines into submission.Rumours have been swirling around a new film since at least 2017, when Ready Player One’s Zach Penn was reported to be writing an episode for studio Warner Bros that would cast Michael B Jordan as the lead. Now, as the original 1999 film returns to US cinemas, writer-director Lilly Wachowski, who oversaw the original trilogy alongside her sister Lana, has given the concept her blessing (while suggesting she is too busy to get involved herself).“I like it when stories go out into the world and then come back to you in different ways,” Wachowski told Film. “I mean, that’s what storytelling is all about. I’m part of a bigger thing. I don’t have any ownership over stuff like that, so whatever story anybody wants to tell, I can’t wait to hear. I hope it’s better than the original.”The Matrix introduced the concept of life as a simulation designed to keep humanity from rebelling, a sort of virtual opium of the masses for the 21st century. Tear through the humdrum carapace of everyday existence, it suggested, and you too might be able to redefine yourself as a kung fu-kicking babe magnet in shades and leather. Dive down the rabbit hole and available upgrades might include enhanced charisma, new vocabularies, and even the ability to see without one’s eyes. Almost anything was possible within the Matrix – damn, give Boris Johnson the Red Pill and send him blustering after the White Rabbit, and he might even be able to solve Brexit.The problem here is that even the Wachowskis were not able to repeat the success of The Matrix with sequels Reloaded and Revolutions, which means it’s difficult to imagine how anyone else can. With its heady philosophical ideas increasingly torpedoed by big-budget action motifs as the series stumbled towards its disappointing conclusion, the trilogy was eventually fully absorbed into Hollywood’s own matrix of blandness, like one of the many annoying clones created by Hugo Weaving’s nefarious Agent Smith.A truly visionary writer-director – Denis Villeneuve, Christopher Nolan or Alex Garland spring to mind – might be able to wring new life from the concept, but of these only Villeneuve, the Canadian director of Blade Runner 2049, has shown any sign in recent times of being keen on uploading himself to the Hollywood sequel mainframe. I Am Mother’s Grant Sputore, District 9’s Neill Blomkamp and Moon’s Duncan Jones would be other names to get fans excited, though only the first of those has an unblemished CV. Whoever takes it on should be told to focus first and foremost on the ideas that made The Matrix so intriguing, rather than blowing audiences away with giant FX cannons.Imagine, for a moment, if the Wachowskis’ first movie had been left as a standalone episode. It might well have developed even greater cult status by now – just as 1982’s Blade Runner did after being allowed to percolate through the discerning sci-fi fan’s senses for the best part of three decades. The fact this did not happen stands as testament to the dangers of studios greenlighting sequels before they are really ready to emerge fully formed into the light. There is a reason James Cameron has spent more than a decade working on sequels to (the far less iconic) Avatar, and that Ready Player One writer Ernest Cline is planning a new novel before even considering venturing back into the brand-heavy virtual world brought to the big screen by Steven Spielberg last year. Get these followups wrong, and there is a serious danger of tarnishing the original episode.The Matrix’s enigma, like the Carrollian underworld that partly inspired it, is intrinsic to its value as a cultural totem. That first movie was so inspiring because it introduced us to a superbly stylised, incredibly cool inner world that it seemed we would never be able to fully understand.Once we know the functions of Smith, the Oracle and Neo himself within the fabric of this digital labyrinth, they become far less intriguing. Once we see what the machines actually look like they become far less horrifying – the relentless Sentinels introduced in Reloaded, tunnelling their way towards Zion, are boring machines in more than one sense. A mere glimpse of this secret digital Shangri-La, a peek through the looking glass at what lies beyond, it turns out, was all we should ever have been given."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6b718dc8c767bba7e36d0e60dbd7315ac51b413/0_98_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf955ad3d43b2c377863a33957001029","title":"bury face expulsion carabao cup sheffield wednesday efl","story":"Bury have been given a two-week deadline to save their EFL status after the suspension on their notice of withdrawal of membership was lifted by the organisation on Thursday.The EFL has suspended next week’s Carabao Cup match against Sheffield Wednesday and indicated it would tolerate no further delays in its demand the club provides reassurances over its financial position. Bury have already had their opening matches of the League One season against MK Dons and Accrington Stanley postponed.Bury’s League Cup game was called off after the EFL said the club had failed to meet Wednesday’s deadline to provide further satisfactory information regarding creditor debts.The EFL said: “Following extensive discussions and correspondence between the club’s ownership and the league, the additional information provided lacks the clarity required and as a result of the league not being able to defer the decision any later than today, the club’s Carabao Cup tie on Tuesday 13 August 2019 will not take place as scheduled in accordance with Carabao Cup rules.“The EFL will continue to concentrate its efforts on working constructively with the club and Mr Dale to obtain the detail required to avoid any further suspensions. However, the EFL board is of the strong opinion that it cannot continue to suspend fixtures indefinitely and, after Wednesday’s deadline for information was passed without a successful resolution, it will now lift the suspension on the notice of withdrawal of membership of the EFL.“Bury were served the notice of withdrawal of membership on 25 July 2019 and it has remained suspended until today. As per the league’s articles of association, this will give the club 14 days to meet all outstanding requirements of the league’s insolvency policy or its membership of the EFL will be withdrawn.”No one at the club was immediately available for comment.

And yet Martin was able to make a dream move to play for the Premier League club he has supported since birth his father is the former West Ham captain Alvin Martin, who played for the club for 21 years. At 33, he has been signed to provide experienced back-up to the undisputed first-choice Lukasz Fabianski and Roberto, the Spanish keeper signed on a free transfer from Eyol this summer. JBAngeliño, defender, PSV Eindhoven to Manchester City, £5.3mThe left-back position has become worrisome for City. With Benjamin Mendy’s reliability as a social media star and master of ceremonies during trophy celebrations far more assured than his fitness record, Pep Guardiola has been forced to improvise. Oleksandr Zinchenko filled in last season, just as the now departed Fabian Delph did previously. City chose to option the buy-back clause they inserted last year during the sale of the Spaniard to PSV. Angeliño, signed as back-up, has returned to the club he first joined as a 15-year-old. By little coincidence, his re-signing adds a player who counts as ‘homegrown’ to City’s squad of expensive imports. JBJesús Vallejo, defender, Real Madrid to Wolves, loanHaving Jorge Mendes’ contacts book to hand continues to bring great benefits to Wolves. Furthering the club’s wealth of Iberian talent is the central defender who captained Spain’s Under-21 team to a convincing victory in this summer’s European Championship. Vallejo, 22, may well still make it at Real Madrid but has Raphaël Varane and Sergio Ramos ahead of him in the queue. He has been sent to England to learn his trade in a similar fashion to his Real and Spain U21 teammate Dani Ceballos, whose move to Arsenal received far more column inches. If he can stay fit – he struggled with injury last season – then Wolves have a defender of talent and poise. JBTom Heaton, goalkeeper, Burnley to Aston Villa, £8mHeaton’s departure from Burnley registered as a surprise, and particularly in the light of his impact on his now former club last season. His return to Sean Dyche’s team on 30 December coincided with a revival of form that took Burnley away from the relegation zone they ended 2018 in. Heaton was the club captain but, with one year left on his contract, Burnley sought to cash in on the 33-year-old, and will turn back to Joe Hart or Nick Pope. Villa have been allowed to purchase a goalkeeper of lengthy Premier League experience and a more than decent organiser of a defence. JBVictor Camarasa, midfielder, Real Betis to Crystal Palace, loanA shining light in Cardiff’s relegation back to the Championship, Camarasa has decided another tough season of Premier League football is just what he wants. The Spanish midfielder quickly settled under Neil Warnock, the right man to teach him the graft required to battle it out at the bottom of the table. Camarasa’s ability at set-pieces will be an added bonus for Roy Hodgson, who could use the loanee out wide as well as in the centre of midfield. He is happy with the ball at his feet, whether it is dribbling or finding the right pass. If Wilfried Zaha does depart, Camarasa’s creative streak could go some way to replacing the winger. He even scored five goals in 32 league appearances, a impressive feat for a midfielder in a doomed side. WUGeorge Hirst, forward, OH Leuven to Leicester, £450,000Hirst signing for Leicester will come as a shock to few, least of all those at Sheffield Wednesday. The 20-year ended his season-long stay east of Brussels by moving from the Belgian B club owned by the Srivaddhanaprabha family, who also own Leicester, and managed until February by Nigel Pearson, the captain of the Wednesday team that David Hirst, George’s father and Owls legend, played in. Wednesday had been powerless to stop the younger Hirst, who had fallen out of contract, moving to Leuven for a knockdown compensation fee of £150,000 and even more powerless to stop him moving to Leicester. For a striker considered one of the best prospects in his age group, £450,000 looks cheap. JBCallum Robinson, forward, Preston to Sheffield United, £8mThe 24-year-old became the Blades’ record signing when they bought him in July, although they soon surpassed that fee by splashing out £10m to bring in Lys Mousset from Bournemouth. Robinson, a Republic of Ireland international, will help supply Mousset while contributing goals himself. He is an exciting sort with potential to improve: fast, tricky, direct and dynamic, capable of playing across the forward line. Norwich were outbid for him by Sheffield United, while the other newly promoted side, Aston Villa, may regret releasing him as a youngster. PDChe Adams, forward, Birmingham City to Southampton, £15mTo fans of Birmingham, for whom he scored 22 goals in last season’s Championship, he became known as “Chelé”. To Southampton he has the makings of a terrific Premier League striker – strong on the ball, a dangerous runner and a deadly, swift shooter. That is why they paid £15m for the 23-year-old in the summer and why, assuming Danny Ings stay fit, Saints are hopeful their scoring problems may be coming to an end. PDPhilip Billing, midfielder, Huddersfield to Bournemouth, £15mThe Dane is an unusual talent who was always likely to re-emerge in the Premier League after some splendid performances amid Huddersfield’s woes last season. For £15m Bournemouth have got a player who can bring both solidity and ingenuity to their midfield. Once quite a timid giant, Billing has learned to use his physique to his advantage, enabling him to showcase his astute reading of play, a lovely range of passing and a ferocious left-footed shot. PDJames Justin, defender, Luton Town to Leicester City, £8mThe stars of Luton’s triumph in League One last season were their full-backs, both of whom were snapped up by Premier League clubs in the summer. Jack Stacey has gone to Bournemouth while Leicester moved for Justin. The 21-year-old played at left-back in what was his breakthrough campaign last season but is also adept on the right. Leicester are well equipped in both positions, since Ben Chilwell and Ricardo Pereira are amongst the best around, but Justin will keep both on their toes and it will be interesting to see how he takes opportunities when they come.

He wasn’t Elvis, Jay-Z or Dylan. The late singer of New York’s Silver Jews and Purple Mountains – the band with which he emerged from self-appointed exile, and who released their eponymous debut only last month – wrote songs that were awkward and askew, that either by design but more likely execution were not made for mass appeal. Berman made outsider music: songs to be enjoyed and championed beneath the glass ceiling for voices like his.And yet there’s a period of the 1990s when a collection of American musicians – disparate, often unknown to each other – were as crucial in understanding the States’ complexity as names who sold records a hundred times over. This is music, often home recorded – as much of Berman’s was – that showcased a refracted vision of Americana, articulated by the likes of Will Oldham, Bill Callahan of Smog, the Handsome Family, John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats, Daniel Johnston, Vic Chesnutt and more.Like those artists, Berman’s work suggests he had a deep and complicated love for his country. Purple Mountains even took their name from a mondegreen of the lyrics to America the Beautiful. His best songs articulate a nation that is beguiling, but covered in human grime. When he sings of a “jagged skyline of car keys”, on Black and Brown Blues, a standout of Silver Jews’ 1996 album The Natural Bridge, his dewy voice sounds as if it’s being poured from a throat in which all tendons have been unwound, creating a cinematic American cityscape.Two years later, on the song Blue Arrangements, taken from Silver Jews’ – the Joos, to their fans – third album American Water, he describes in a languid vocal, duelling with that of then bandmate Stephen Malkmus, “the kids in the corner all covered in dirt, caught trespassing under the moon”. It’s hard not to imagine Berman as Huckleberry Finn, wide-eyed, muddy kneed, dressed in plaid. Then he sings: “My father came in from wherever he’d been, and kicked my shit all over the room,” Berman had a fractured relationship with his lobbyist father, Richard, once describing him as a demon – the two were estranged at the time of the singer’s death.Although the Joos were created in New York with his friend Malkmus and fellow future Pavement member Bob Nastanovich (Berman putting together the band while working as a security guard at the city’s Whitney Museum of American Art), the Virginia-born bandleader moved back to the south, to Nashville. He understood the significance of bedding down in a place that proudly proclaims itself Music City. “We’re gonna live in Nashville and I’ll make a career,” he sings on the song Tennessee, “out of writing sad songs and getting paid by the tear.”The song We Are Real, another from American Water, sees each couplet compete with each other to be the song’s defining take. Not only does he rhyme “Virginia” with “with ya”, which not only works but zings, but he shares the thought, “won’t soul music change, now that our souls have turned strange?” It’s a line that’s very funny, linguistically smart and insufferably sad, as suited to the therapist’s office as it is a lyric book. It’s almost like he’d written his own epitaph: a line that says more about why Berman struggled with the world than anything he ever said in an interview.Berman’s songs always seemed to be trying to make sense of the landscape changing before him, and within him. His songs suggest that their creator had so many qualities we cherish – empathy, emotional literacy, bravery – and yet what he lacked was the understanding of self that keeps a person shackled and safe: he struggled with substance misuse and had mental health problems.There’s another line from We Are Real that is perhaps the one that will come to define David Berman: “All my favourite singers couldn’t sing.” Isn’t that so often the case? And yet Berman’s voice is as important to understanding the American – and indeed human – experience as almost anyone’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77ab08c5c2cae70ed5e95248ec2b75bc0e27e8ce/0_257_5210_3126/master/5210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d68cf4be831517645868084c4426050","title":"freedom fashion and being scouted on facebook how peggy gou became the worlds coolest dj","story":"She’s got a fashion label, a festival and a million Instagram followers – but the South Korean DJ and producer says she’s had to fight hard for it allBetween the concrete walls of Funkhaus in Berlin, on a muggy July night, a whistling, whooping crowd are clapping sweaty palms together and chanting: “Peg-gy! Peg-gy! Peg-gy!”Peggy Gou, the 29-year-old South Korean DJ and producer, is bringing her set to a storming close. Wearing a silky Louis Vuitton shirt and blue sunglasses, she has woven in acid house, drum’n’bass and grime, but nothing gets a response like the tantalising kickdrum of her own recent single, Starry Night. The other DJs, Palms Trax and Benji B, hold their own, but the unadulterated love is reserved for Gou. When she’s not behind the decks, she can be found in the crowd, posing for an endless queue of selfies.It is special to catch Gou in Berlin, because while she ostensibly lives here, she is usually DJing around the world, being gifted toy giraffes (her favourite animal) or T-shirts printed with puns on her name (“Just Gou it”). Recently, she tells me over coffee, she managed to squeeze in a holiday in Ibiza – a “holiday”, in DJ terms, meaning that she managed to avoid travelling for a whole weekend.Since arriving in Berlin, she has quickly risen to become one of dance music’s biggest names. “Before I was a DJ, I was a raver,” she says proudly. She would spend every weekend in Berghain, where the music she heard shaped the unpredictable DJ she is today. “I really like Detroit DJs, like Maurice Fulton. You feel like he’s going to play something techno, then all of a sudden it’s disco.”Since materialising with her first release in 2016, Gou now has her own record label, a fashion label in association with Louis Vuitton’s Virgil Abloh, nearly a million Instagram followers and her very own mini-festival in London: this month’s Pleasure Gardens. She has never had a manager, evidently preferring to be in charge. When I turn up to meet her at a nail bar where she is getting a manicure, Gou takes over from her manicurist and quickly finishes the job herself. The resulting neon tips are immaculate.“My parents didn’t let me come back to Korea, because I failed, and they were like: ‘Do you know how much your course is? If you don’t pass, you’re not coming back’.” They made her stay at school for an extra two months to get the qualification. She moved to Berlin straight afterwards.“This was my life in Berlin: working at a record store, working on music at home, Berghain every Sunday,” she summarises. “My parents were like: ‘You wanted to do fashion, now you want to do music, what’s next?’ I said to them: ‘Give me a few years. If I can’t, I will come back to Korea.’” Berlin’s cliquey club scene could be alienating. “I was always the outsider,” she remembers of her time in the record store. “The owner of that place ... When I’d talk about Berghain, he’d be like: ‘Why are you talking about Berghain?’”Hostility from vinyl-heads was not enough to hold Gou back: in 2016, she began releasing a slew of EPs of lithe and lethal house. In 2018, she scaled new heights with the Once EP, containing It Makes You Forget (Itgehane), the tune that launched a thousand videos of English-speaking crowds awkwardly and enthusiastically singing in Korean.She adds: “I had to fight a lot for what I want.” Referring to the cinematic video for Starry Night – directed by her partner, Jonas Lindstroem – she jokes that she is thinking of adding a tattoo of the video’s young taekwondo fighter to the many inkings on her arms. Aside from battles behind the scenes, Gou often finds herself a lightning rod for public criticism that sometimes belies the racism and misogyny that still persists in dance music.But Gou is learning to rise above it. “Of course I do read comments, I do care, but I have a thicker skin than before,” she says. “I’m going to keep on doing what I want to do: life is too short. I choose who I take the advice and criticism from.”As her relentless jetsetting summer draws to a close with Pleasure Gardens, Gou is preparing to retreat a little, and begin work on her debut album in September. She quotes one of her heroes, the French DJ Laurent Garnier: “Don’t worry if you disappear for three months. People will still remember you.” But her impatient, focussed determination makes it seem doubtful anyone will forget her. “I’m a very ambitious person, and I have so many things I want to do. I haven’t done even half of it yet.” Peggy Gou Presents the Pleasure Gardens is at Finsbury Park, London, on 18 August "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99788ee8ba8e4673f2770a68ad698c538f88d73a/121_559_1300_780/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5092288cf5c8207609be5cd5158712ac","title":"no 10 refuses to rule out election shortly after 31 october brexit","story":"Downing St could delay election until days after Brexit if Boris Johnson loses confidence voteNo 10 has not ruled out scheduling an election in the immediate days after leaving the EU on 31 October if Boris Johnson is forced into one by the loss of a confidence motion, according to party sources.Speculation about the timing of an autumn election is rife as Downing Street tries to figure out how to deal with the fallout if Tory rebels join with opposition parties to vote down the government.Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s most senior aide and “assistant to the prime minister”, has told ministers and officials that the government is prepared to call an election to be held after 31 October and leave anyway if it loses a confidence vote.However, the idea of leaving the EU – possibly without a deal – in the middle of an election while parliament is suspended for campaigning would be a highly controversial move.It would also be extremely risky for Johnson to lead the UK into an election in the middle of potential disruption to food supplies, travel and trade caused by a no-deal Brexit.No 10 did not deny that this could be a possible course of action in the event of losing a no-confidence vote, after the Spectator mooted the possible date of a post-Brexit election as 1 November and the FT reported it would happen in the “days after”.Labour could hold a confidence motion in Johnson’s government as early as the first week of September to test whether he commands the support of the House of Commons.There would be a subsequent 14 days in which MPs could try to form an alternative government but a general election would be triggered if they could not manage to do so.Opponents of a no-deal Brexit would want an election to happen before 31 October in order to prevent a crash-out, but the Fixed-term Parliaments Act gives discretion to the incumbent prime minister to name a suitable polling day.A cross-party group of MPs is working on plans to stop a no-deal Brexit either via legislative means or collapsing Johnson’s government, possibly sitting through the autumn recess in order to frustrate a no-deal exit.David Lammy, a Labour MP opposed to a hard Brexit, has said the plan to hold an election after crashing out without a deal would be a “constitutional and democratic outrage that will impoverish millions” but he said a “a flaw in Cummings’ plan to force us out during an election is we can refuse to back dissolution without a Brexit delay”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46e29e91c6db00c05c5f215ddcbfa5acb15fbe8a/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74ba3b878ca137ee338d34db13a5db76","title":"the lol word the queer collective transforming comedy","story":"This queer collective proves there’s a place for comedy that isn’t straight or male with a heart-rendingly hilarious Edinburgh showJodie Mitchell is slowly moving around the stage, blowing into a microphone. Playing God, Mitchell puffs heavily, so as to clear an imaginary cloud, before pointing out some of the omnipotent deity’s more questionable creations, from the bee sting to the – what’s that? Ah, yes, the fragile male ego. Mitchell, cool and charismatic throughout, exhales loudly on to the invisible patriarchal mindset, which responds by crying like a baby. The audience erupts with laughter.This is the LOL Word, a collective of queer female and non-binary comedians founded at the Edinburgh festival three years ago by five friends who were all bored by the male-dominated comedy industry. Alongside Mitchell, they are Chloe Petts, Chloe Green and comedy duo Shelf (Rachel Watkeys Dowie and Ruby Clyde, who have produced the current show from afar). There’s also a changing lineup of special guests. Their name, as many queer women will know, is a play on the infamous TV series The L Word.The group’s sold-out Monday night show is a snapshot of life without patriarchy and queerphobia. Certainly, the explosive success of The LOL Word, which has also been selling out shows in London, points to a lack of inclusive comedy. “Women and non-binary people were craving comedy that wouldn’t actively upset them or just be completely unrelatable every single time someone walked on stage,” Mitchell tells me.It’s hilarious, slick and smart, with heart-rending insights into the performers’ personal experiences as they put a microscope to the bleak intersection of misogyny and homophobia. This is, explains Mitchell on stage, a way for them to process their trauma.The audience of mostly lesbian and queer people are left emboldened by the evening. The only person looking slightly uncomfortable is a token male audience member called Andrew, who was bold enough to sit on the front row and is soon ridiculed by Petts and Green. That the collective aren’t completely PC is stressed to me before their show, with Mitchell quipping: “We offend people all the time it’s just that it’s the straight, white cis guys.”Petts, who is MCing, opens with a heartwarming sketch about her supportive mum, before explaining how embracing her masculinity means that she sometimes gets misgendered in public places such as coffee shops. The howling that meets her story about correcting a barista for calling her “sir” is indicative of how relatable this content is to the crowd. She is confident, laid-back, casual – and very funny.Elsewhere, Green mixes a maverick comedic cocktail that’s simultaneously wholesome, witty, insightful, graphic and cutting. Everything she pours out is lapped up, from jokes about being invited to a nude lesbian oil party to her former job running the Labour party’s social media channels. At one point, she’s reduced to tears when the crowd readily sings Lou Bega’s Mambo No 5 at her request, before she embarks on a feminist lyrical analysis of the track, noting how it doesn’t pass the Bechdel test. Ironically, she adds, the pornographic film 2 Girls 1 Cup does.It ends with a special guest: singer-songwriter Grace Petrie, whose well-received political songs map the essence of the show. Her appearance is a reflection of The LOL Word’s high standing among LGBTQ+ women and non-binary comics (other guests this fringe include Suzi Ruffell, Sophie Duker and Sarah Keyworth).The LOL Word kicks back against years of demeaning jokes about women and the LGBTQ+ community. This is all about punching up, not down, as Green tells me after the show. As a lesbian, it’s refreshing and revitalising to watch: they are energetic and exciting, oozing with passion.

As such, the new Kindle Oasis has the same aluminium body, asymmetrical design, flush screen and page turn buttons as the previous version. It’s actually 6g lighter than the old model, and 0.1mm thicker, not that you’d notice.The buttons are just as responsive, and for many they will be the reason to buy it, as page-turn buttons are simply better than just a touchscreen when reading. The screen is also as good and responsive as e-ink displays currently get. The 7in display, about the size of a small paperback, is crisp and a delight to read. The 25-LED frontlight is even across the whole page with auto-brightness or manual control.The warm light function moves from brilliant white to a warm yellow over 24 gradations. It’s very similar to the white ambience smart bulbs available from Hue and others that shift in tone of white for less clinical lighting when needed.Like a smartphone you can set it to gradually shift to a warmer white as the sun sets removing blue light to aid with sleep. But some might prefer to have a warmer light all the time. Set to between 12 and 19 on the sliding scale, it matched the colour of a traditional paperback page, which is a game-changer for those looking to replicate the feeling of reading paper as much as possible. A yellow-tinted page appears slightly friendlier than clinical white.The new Oasis is water resistant to IPX8 standards, which means it’ll survive up to 60 minutes at depths of 2m in water. Accidental dunks in the bath or pool should be fine.Despite it being 2019, the Oasis still has a microUSB charging socket (the one typically used on older, cheaper smartphones). Given smartphones, laptops, tablets and Apple are standardising around USB-C charging, having a microUSB socket means you might have to carry a dedicated Kindle cable in the future.Luckily the battery life is excellent. Amazon rates it for six weeks of 30 minutes of reading a day at brightness level 13 set to airplane mode, which works out at 15 hours of reading. In reality, the Oasis lasted long enough for me to get through the equivalent of two 300-page books at a fairly slow reading pace with a mixture of brightness levels and 4G on and off to sync progress.Charging took the best part of three hours with a 5W USB charger, or slightly faster with something more powerful.While the Oasis is well made, with no overly sharp edges and a solid-feeling aluminium frame, the flush screen feels vulnerable. You’ll need some sort of case for it, which is where Amazon has made a backwards step.The 2017 Oasis had magnets on the back allowing a case to snap into place against the thin part, slotting into the groove of the aluminium body. It would then close over the screen, turning on or off the screen as you open it like a book, but also being able to be easily removed. This meant you could easily read the Oasis in its best, balanced and ergonomic state: naked.While Amazon sells cases that do something similar, they cover the entire of the back, clipping in around the edges, which makes them slightly harder to remove for the best reading experience. They are at least attractive, with the premium leather case providing the supple and sumptuous finish of a really expensive notebook - something that was a key selling point for the first generation Kindle Oasis from 2016.Amazon’s Kindle software still nails the mechanics of actually reading a book. There are plenty of customisation options for formatting, including nine fonts, a sliding scale of font size, differing levels of boldness, page spacing, margins and alignment adjustment and new themes, which roll all the settings together into one-tap options. You can even create your own themes and change the size of font on the fly with a pinch-to-zoom on the screen.Amazon’s dictionary, Wikipedia and X-Ray look-up system continues to be excellent for figuring out unfamiliar words, concepts or characters. The quick setting panel makes getting to brightness controls easy, while integrated Goodreads, Audible for audio books and the Kindle store make finding and downloading your next book easy. Syncing locations between audiobooks and ebooks is remarkably good if you have both.The only weakness is the organisation of your library on the home screen, which makes if difficult to find the next in a series of books if you’ve bought a lot. There doesn’t seem to be a way to list something like Ian Rankin’s Rebus series by book order. Still, the search works well enough if you know what you’re looking after.Amazon hasn’t changed much for the latest edition of the Kindle Oasis. Side-by-side they are identical on the outside. But what looks to be a small change – the ability to shift the colour of the frontlight from cold to warm white – makes a surprising amount of difference to the reading experience.The warmer tones of white can match the colour of paper novels, not just the brilliant white of printer paper, and ease strain on your eyes as the sun sinks below the horizon. This is the best e-ink screen going, in the most sumptuous of e-readers.But not every change is good. The loss of the magnetic cases means it’s more difficult to use the Oasis in its purest, most balanced form without anything attached to it. Amazon’s premium leather case is particularly nice, but given I’d want a case just to protect the screen I’d be more inclined to find a slip case or similar.It’s also still difficult to justify spending twice as much on an e-reader over the excellent £120 Kindle Paperwhite, or even the great new £70 basic Kindle. And £230 is really not that far away from the cost of an iPad.But in the era of constant distractions by notifications and the hubbub of modern life, the Oasis is the luxury antidote to overload. It only does one thing, but it does it better than anything else.Pros: long battery life, light, easy to hold, excellent screen, auto-brightness and colour frontlight, great page-turn buttons, luxurious feel, Audible integration, water resistantCons: expensive, cover not included, no magnetic covers, no support for third-party audiobooks, no headphones socket, microUSB This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

What can she do?My external USB hard drive, with 11,000 photos from Windows 7, isn’t recognised by Windows 10. How do I transfer them to Windows 10 for future safekeeping? JakiThe Universal Serial Bus (USB) connects billions of keyboards, mice, joysticks, printers, external hard drives and other peripherals to roughly 1.5bn personal computers, and more than 3bn mobile phones use the smaller Micro USB and newer USB-C versions. It generally works pretty well but most people have probably suffered from a USB device failing or not being recognised.Lots of things can go wrong. The port, the connecting cable, the power supply and the external hard drive (EHD) can all suffer from physical andor electrical faults.Some external hard drives draw their power from the USB port and they may not get enough. This can be a problem if the PC’s motherboard does not supply enough power to the USB port you are using or if the drive is plugged into a non-powered hub. EHDs that have their own power supplies tend to work more reliably.USB cables can fail after prolonged use, though this is more likely to happen to the Micro USB cables used with mobile phones. External hard drive cables rarely fail unless they get the same sort of abuse. However, if you have two devices that use the same type of cable, you can swap them over to see if that solves the problem.Alternatively, it could be a software problem. For example, it could be the lack of a suitable driver, a corrupted driver or a conflict with another USB device.If you do not have a backup and cannot get the drive to work, it may be worth rolling back to Windows 7 and making a backup before reinstalling Windows 10 – or enlisting the help of a friend who is still running Windows 7.You should never lose data because an external USB hard drive fails. Ideally, you should have at least three copies of your photos stored on different media and at least one should be kept in a different place. Schofield’s Second Law of Computing states that data doesn’t really exist unless you have at least two copies of it.You can back up your photos to thumb drives, SD cards, optical discs (CD, DVD, Blu-ray), external hard drives, a local network server or an online service. These include Amazon Photos, Apple’s iCloud, Microsoft OneDrive, Google One and third-party services such as pCloud and Mega.NZ. See my recent answer to “Where’s the cheapest place to store 500GB of data online?”The major hard drive manufacturers have the most experience in debugging hard drive problems and some have free software to help. The leading examples include WD’s Data Lifeguard Diagnostics and Seagate’s SeaTools for Windows. You may already have one installed. If not, check your EHD manufacturer’s website for a tool that could find and fix your missing drive.Most USB failures are glitches. Often, if a device is not recognised by one port, it will work when plugged into a different port or a different PC. If not, the traditional approach – basically, turning your PC off and on again – often works.First, unplug the EHD, unplug it from the mains and unplug and straighten the data cable. Second, restart your PC and wait for two minutes (because Windows 10 keeps loading things in the background even after it claims to be ready for use). Third, plug the connecting cable into the EHD, making sure it is firmly seated. Finally, plug the EHD back into the mains, turn it on (if it has a manual switch) and plug the USB cable back into the PC. With luck, either the PC will recognise the external drive or discover it as a new device and install it with a suitable driver.Turning a PC off and on does not work as well as it used to because of Windows 10’s Fast Startup system. Ideally, we want the PC to forget everything and make a fresh start. With Fast Startup, Windows 10 stores core parts of memory, including the drivers, in a hidden file called hiberfil.sys and just reloads this file when you turn it back on. You could temporarily disable Fast Startup but I’d just move on to the next step.If a reboot doesn’t make Windows renew its USB drivers, you can do it manually. With the EHD plugged in, go to the Start menu and type or paste the words “Device Manager” into the search box, then run the app that comes up. Next, click the arrow (\u0026gt) next to “Disk drives” in the Device Manager program to see a list of the drives that your PC knows about. Look for the drive that is not being recognised. It should be obvious from its name, which might be something like “WD Ext HDD 1021 USB Device” or “WD MyBook” or “Seagate Expansion Desk”, or whatever.Right-click on your EHD and select “Uninstall device” from the pop-up menu. When that has finished, unplug the USB cable.Wait a minute, then plug the USB cable back in. Windows should see the drive and install a driver. Your EHD should then appear in the “This PC” section of Windows 10’s File Explorer.If this doesn’t work, use the Settings app to run Windows Update, restart your PC and try again. Windows Update delivers new drivers and software patches when they become available.Some – usually obscure – USB peripherals use special drivers that you can only download from the manufacturer’s website. If Windows hasn’t found the best driver, it might be worth looking for one. If you find one, follow the same procedure but select “Update driver” from the menu.In passing, users who have no problems with external drives can still use Device Manager. The default setting for USB drives allows their quick removal. This reduces the risk of data corruption when users unplug drives without thinking. Select “Properties” from the pop-up menu, go to the “Policies” tab and change the default to enable write caching in Windows. This improves performance but you must use the “Safely Remove Hardware” option before unplugging devices.USB ports are handled by USB host controllers. To see them, click the arrow next to “Universal Serial Bus controllers”, which will be at or near the bottom of the alphabetical list in Device Manager. As before, right-click each host controller and select Uninstall. Once you have finished, restart your PC. Windows will automatically reinstall the USB host controllers with clean, fresh versions.Beyond this, there is not much you can do. If a PC has serious problems, you could always reinstall the BIOS firmware and update the motherboard’s chipset drivers. The latest versions should be available from the PC or motherboard manufacturer’s website. However, non-technical users should never have to do this type of thing unless prompted.For example, you may have done a firmware update last year because most big PC suppliers rolled out fixes for the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities covered in an earlier answer. But it shouldn’t be necessary for a simple problem like a USB drive not being recognised.All hard drives fail, typically after five or more years but sometimes after a few months. This is why we need backups. Sometimes EHDs fail but the drive still works. If you don’t have a backup and cannot afford a professional data recovery service, this is a last resort.Research your EHD online to find out how big the drive is (2.5 inch or 3.5 inch) and the type of drive (usually SATA), so you can buy the correct enclosure. Plastic enclosures are cheap and mostly good enough. Metal enclosures with built-in fans are better for cooling a hard drive that is in constant use and making it last longer.Have you got a question?

It’s also reopening for visitors, and offers them great walking, cycling and fine fish-and-chipsIt has been a tough week for the businesses of Whaley Bridge, which was evacuated last Thursday amid fears that the Toddbrook reservoir, above the town, could burst its dam following torrential rainfall.Residents and business owners were allowed back home on Wednesday, and shops, cafes and pubs are set to reopen by the weekend. They actively want people to come and visit, according to Martin Thomas, chair of the town council.“The community of Whaley Bridge is looking forward to the return to normality over the next few days. The dam has now been made safe and an alternative pumping system installed to bypass the reservoir. Thanks to the work of the emergency services, there has been only relatively minor flooding, and the town is open to welcome visitors,” he said.My husband lived in Whaley when we were first courting so I know it well, having swum in Toddbrook reservoir, drunk in most of the pubs and eaten far too many cakes at the Bakehouse. Here, then, is my very subjective guide to Whaley Bridge.Off-road, there are great trails by Erwood and Fernliee reservoirs, which lead towards Buxton or over to Kinder Scout. If you are a cycling masochist, check out the cobbled climb up Start Lane from the Kettleshulme direction. Whaley is also blessed with an excellent independent bike shop: the Bike Factory, opposite the Co-op on Buxton Road.Opened by two sisters in 2013, the Bakehouse has become a Whaley institution. Its cherry bakewells are, in my opinion, better than any on sale in actual Bakewell the grilled cheese sarnies make the perfect salty gooey lunchtime treat and its sausage rolls are the stuff of legend. It is mainly a takeaway place but there is seating outside, with heaters and blankets for the colder months.• 42a Market Street, thebridgebakehouseMuch more than just an off-licence, Goyt wines has a wine bar upstairs that’s open Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Book ahead for Chippie Tea Night every Friday each summer: it’s possible to bring in fish and chips from the Fryery, a few doors down, and wash it down with a glass of champagne, a bottle of local craft beer or pretty much anything else you fancy.• 1 Canal Street, goytwinesLondoners will not believe the prices at this bric-a-brac shop on the main Buxton Road. Think armchairs for £30, perfect for that upholstery project G Plan sideboards for a fraction of the cost in other antique shops mahogany dinner tables and much more. The charity shop next door, which raises money for the Blythe House Hospice, is distinctly better than average, too.• 3 Market Street, finderskeepersuk.org.ukWhaley is blessed with two chip shops but I like the Fryery best. It stays open later and its curry sauce is stupendous – and offered hot or not (get the spicy one). It’s a proper chippy, with cans of shandy, and dandelion \u0026amp burdock, and pickled eggs in jars on the counter. • 5 Canal Street, on FacebookThis is a great little shop selling prints and originals from local artists, all framed in-house. It also has a fine selection of jewellery and gifts. • 4 Market Street, jarvagalleryI’ve spent many happy afternoons with my 10-year-old stepdaughter at this superlative playground, which is right underneath Toddbrook reservoir. Don’t let that put you off now the dam is safe you’ll miss out on the zipwire otherwise!• Reservoir RoadWhaley is known locally as a drinkers’ town, and you are spoilt for choice for a pint. The Goyt Inn (8 Bridge Street) is the most traditional local pub, particularly cosy in winter. The tiny Whaley Nook Tap Rooms sells craft beer from a number of local brewers, and the Cock is best for a family pub lunch.There are lots of lovely walks right from Whaley Bridge for even the littlest legs. Head towards Taxal, by the River Goyt, where there are plenty of paddling spots. The graveyard at Taxal church is often visited by a friendly donkey, who always appreciates a carrot or an apple. Head through the woods towards the derelict Taxal Lodge on the magnificently named Linglongs Road and see if you can spot the fairy tree, where superstitious locals have left gifts for the elves.• A women-only solidarity bike ride to Whaley Bridge – to eat at the Bridge Bakehouse – starts from Deli No 29 in Romiley at 9am on Saturday 10 AugustLooking for a holiday with a difference?

Insiders warn that modelling can leave minors vulnerable to physical abuse, 12-hour-days and unrelenting pressureby Greg BakerAFPGetty Images. Co-written by Xin Liu and Pak YiuThe children’s apparel market is growing faster than any other clothing sector in China and was worth more than $40.5bn (£33bn) in 2018, according to Euromonitor. This, combined with the rise of “kidfluencers” sponsored by brands to promote products on social media, is spurring greater demand for young models across the country – but experts warn of the heavy cost of pursuing such deals.“If children don’t listen to the parents, then I think hitting them is quite standard,” Lee Ku, the founder of Le Show Stars modelling school, told AFP. A video of a mother kicking her three-year-old daughter in fury at her failure to comply during a modelling job went viral earlier this year, causing outrage online. And footage emerged in early August online of a young boy modelling thick winter clothes outside as temperatures soared to 37C, also drawing heavy online criticism.But in an industry where minors can earn 10,000 yuan (£1,200) a session, Lee says the clip is the tip of the iceberg and, from his experience, such violent behaviour from parents is not unusual on shoots. Child models sometimes go through more than 100 outfit changes in a session, often working from morning till night. But mental health experts warn it is not just physical exhaustion they have to contend with – there may be long-term emotional implications.“Children from the age of zero to six are mentally developing, they need a lot of exploration and freedom,” explained child psychologist Gong Xueping. “At work, the child model will deliberately show a lot of different expressions ... but this is contrary to the child’s own feelings of the moment. This limits the development of both emotional abilities and more complex psychological abilities for children, so I think it’s a very bad choice,” Gong added.But there remains no shortage of parents interested in pushing their children into the profession. Founded three years ago, Le Show Stars was one of the first modelling schools in Beijing, where customers pay up to £95 for a private one-on-one lesson.Four-year-old twins Yumi and Yuki Xiao are not yet professional models, but for nearly two years they have been taking classes teaching them how to pose and pace the catwalk, in the hopes that they can break into the industry.“For some catwalking competitions, they have to be in the makeup room by 6am,” their father, Xiao Liang, said. “The real competition starts at 2pm, and they finish around 3pm or 4. So the whole thing takes a whole day. From 6am to 6pm – 12 hours is pretty standard.” Their parents invest in taking them around the country to compete in hundreds of national child modelling competitions.“It’s a lot of fun, I like being on stage,” insisted Yumi.Like many other parents, Xiao says he initially enrolled the two in child modelling to build their self-confidence, but after Yumi and Yuki showed interest they started to invest more time and money into building a possible child modelling career path for them. Occasionally the twins are paid to model seasonal fashion lines for big brands. “I think they are one of a kind – firstly, they’re twins, and they’re also boy-girl twins,” Xiao says. “They also like it, which is why we are giving them this opportunity. I think they have a natural advantage over other kids,” he added.China’s child labour laws are complicated and parents of underage models are sometimes paid in secret to sidestep the red tape required to employ them. Responding to the kicking video, the authorities in Hangzhou, where the incident took place, introduced regulations to limit the hours children work and ban children under 10 from being brand spokespeople. But many feel that authorities are doing too little to protect children from exploitation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/926f39f638412d70f9366bb4d4d8d3427219d4a0/0_250_5192_3116/master/5192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1faf9f4fab34834623f06036e1bab3d5","title":"explosion military base russia arkhangelsk","story":"Explosion at military range in Arkhangelsk is second deadly defence incident in weekTwo people have been killed and radiation levels reportedly spiked after a rocket engine exploded during a test in northern Russia, in the second deadly incident at a Russian defence installation this week.There was a sudden rise in radiation levels in the nearby city of Severodvinsk, Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency reported, citing municipal officials.The explosion took place at a military testing range in the Arkhangelsk region, where specialists were working on a liquid-fuel jet engine, Russia’s ministry of defence said. Those injured included military specialists and civilian engineers for the rocket engine’s developer.Some reports from state-run media suggested the blaze occurred aboard a vessel, while the military’s account implied it happened on land. Russia maintains a veil of secrecy around its military installations in the region, near where its northern fleet, including nuclear submarines, are stationed.Early reports also suggested that there were heightened radiation levels near the town of Nyonoks, where there is a site for testing ballistic missiles carried by Russia’s nuclear-powered submarines.The defence ministry denied reports of a rise in radiation levels, saying that levels were normal and that there had been “no harmful discharges into the atmosphere”.Earlier this week a fire at a military ammunition depot in Siberia forced more than 16,500 people to evacuate their homes, as exploding shells sent deadly shrapnel flying for miles around. The fire left one person dead and 13 more injured, and took firefighters more than 16 hours to extinguish.Investigators have signalled that they believe negligence is to blame for the Siberian fire, opening a criminal case for the mishandling of explosives and blaming the “human factor” for the blaze."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d6d3403ca98eebb423f4f06bbb13e54c750ddf/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc4046ede1995fe4eb8eb88237ff9a1f","title":"kashmir communications blackout is draconian says un envoy","story":"Exclusive: Special rapporteur speaks out as Indian-administered territory faces fourth day in lockdown The unprecedented communications blackout imposed on Indian-administered Kashmir could signal a departure in the way democratic states clamp down on information in contentious areas, the UN’s special rapporteur on freedom of expression has said.“There’s something about this shutdown that is draconian in a way other shutdowns usually are not,” David Kaye told the .The territory faces its fourth day in lockdown, imposed hours before the Indian government revoked Kashmir’s special status on Monday – stripping away the autonomy it was granted in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in 1947.

International sanctions are imposed against both.India masses troops along its western frontier with Pakistan and the Kashmir boundary after blaming Pakistani insurgents for a deadly attack at the Indian parliament. The standoff ends in October 2002 after international mediation.Suspected rebels sneak into an army base in Indian-controlled Kashmir and kill at least 18 soldiers. Indian forces later attack militant bases in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.A car bombing of a paramilitary convoy in Indian-controlled Kashmir kills 40 Indian soldiers. Militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed, headquartered in Pakistan, claims responsibility. India blames Pakistan and promises a crushing response.India\u0027s central government changes part of the Indian constitution and downgrades Jammu and Kashmir from one state to two territories. The changes eliminate Kashmir\u0027s right to its own constitution, limit its decision-making power, and allow non-Kashmiri Indians to settle there.Communications are often blocked in Indian-administered Kashmir, but the most recent clampdown is unprecedented in a time of relative peace. Unlike previous instances, landline phones and cable TV have been cut off. A strict curfew also means people are unable to leave their homes during the day, while only limited movement has been allowed at night.The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since\u0026nbspIndia\u0026nbspand Pakistan came into being in 1947.Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world\u0027s most heavily militarised borders: the ‘line of control’ based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.India and Pakistan have gone to war three times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous ‘princely states’ across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.Kashmir’s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, has been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.\u0026nbspAn additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.On Monday 5 August 2019, the government issued a presidential order to abolish Kashmir’s special status. The government argued that the provision was only intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan – which quickly called India’s actions illegal – and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with\u0026nbspextreme force\u0026nbspin 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.For Indians, control of Kashmir – part of the country’s only Muslim-majority state – has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. Michael Safi and Rebecca RatcliffeThe restrictions have prevented people from calling for ambulances, accessing information or checking on family members. On Thursday, an opposition activist filed a petition in India’s top court challenging the security lockdown and communications block.On Wednesday, one man arriving at Delhi airport from Srinagar, Kashmir’s biggest city, described the state as being “like a prison”. Soayib Qureshi, a Delhi-based lawyer, who arrived on the same day, said he had been given a handwritten boarding pass to take the flight because systems were down.Kaye said that, globally, communication blackouts tended to be focused on internet or mobile phone coverage. He pointed to the suspension of internet access during the school exam period in countries such as Iraq, Ethiopia and Uganda, which governments said were an effort to stop cheating.Governments around the world have used internet blackouts, or blocked popular platforms such as WhatsApp, at times of political crisis. Several countries have also used temporary outages to try to foil cheats in national exams. The controls India has put on communications in Kashmir – blocking phone lines and the internet, and limiting travel to the region – have created a rare degree of isolation.Netblocks monitors outages worldwide, and has recorded dozens of cases this year alone. But it is rare for all communication, including phone lines, to be severed. Other countries that have limited their citizens’ communications, both temporarily and long-term, in recent years include:The UN rapporteur for freedom of expression added: “I can’t say this hasn’t happened before – but I can’t recall a situation were there has been a total blackout of not only the two-way multi-point communication systems that we are familiar with now – anything on the internet, WhatsApp, etc – but also the one-direction communications like TV.“That’s pretty extensive and one of my concerns would be – in part because this is happening in a democratic state – it could be seen as a new departure for many states that are thinking about how to clamp down on the flow of information.”He said it was hard to identify a set of circumstances where a country shutting down access to the internet, especially for an extensive period of time, was legal under international law.A spokesperson for the UN office for human rights added: “We are deeply concerned that the latest restrictions in Indian-administered Kashmir will exacerbate the human rights situation in the region.”The US senator Bob Menendez and the US representative Eliot Engel, representing the US foreign affairs committee, said that “transparency and political participation are the cornerstones of democracy”, and that the committee hoped the Indian government abided by these principles. It also warned Pakistan against retaliatory aggression, after fierce rhetoric from the Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, over the revocation of Indian-administered Kashmir’s special status.On Wednesday, Pakistan announced it would expel the Indian ambassador and suspend trade. It came after remarks by Khan suggested India could carry out ethnic cleansing in Kashmir. He said: “They will try to remove the local people and bring in others and make them a majority, so that the locals become nothing but slaves.”Indian-administered Kashmir has had special status since 1954, giving it a degree of autonomy including its own constitution, as well as rules that prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believe this is crucial to protecting the demography and traditions of India’s only Muslim-majority state.Delhi has insisted the ending of autonomy for the region is an internal matter.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b9878f7919f08eb022daac7f3380e24ab3f17cb/413_10_1558_935/master/1558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2054515872f2bbcb1a34fd1054765823","title":"kenyan lawmaker zuleikha hassan and baby ejected from parliament session","story":"Several colleagues walked out of parliament after Zuleikha Hassan was forced to leaveSome Kenyan lawmakers are protesting against a decision by the temporary speaker of parliament’s lower house to eject their colleague who was holding her young child during a session of the legislature.Zuleikha Hassan was ejected from the floor of the National Assembly on Wednesday with her five-month-old baby.Hassan, a mother of three, said she had to bring the baby to parliament because she was unable to make other arrangements and did not want to miss work.Christopher Omulele, temporary speaker of the National Assembly, said: “As much as she might want to take care of her child, this is not the place for it.”Parliament orderlies forced Hassan to leave the chamber.

Atambayev, who then retreated to his compound, has defied repeated summons from investigators.Jeenbekov accused Atambayev of violating the constitution during a hastily convened security council meeting on Thursday. “By putting up fierce armed resistance to the investigative measures undertaken within the framework of the law, Almazbek Atambayev gravely trampled upon the constitution and laws of the Kyrgyzstan,” the president said, according to Interfax news agency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3743517028a3da91ac3e1b9a07b2705c61b5b7/0_29_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8590382d283a61afa0a13c61af3f576","title":"the sustainable surfer meet the man behind the worlds first fully recyclable wetsuit","story":"It is estimated that 380 tonnes of wetsuit waste is dumped every year. But one company has come up with a radical solutionOut the top of St Agnes, a steep village on Cornwall’s north coast, sits a small utopia. The disused mine stack at Wheal Kitty overlooks a group of warehouses reinventing local industry: there is the HQ of the pioneering marine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage, its big green eye logo staring at zero-waste shop Incredible Bulk. Next door to that is Canteen, a community-minded cafe uniting local people over £5 meals and long trestle tables. Often they are ravenous from a surf or beach clean at Trevaunance Cove down the cliff, a hypersaturated blue on this scorcher of a summer’s day.Then there are the offices and flagship store of Finisterre, an outdoor apparel company focused on sustainability and functionality. Tom Kay, who founded the business 15 years ago, meets me in the office breakout area. The place has the sweet, salty tang of surfboard wax, and Kay’s dog, Otis, roams around under employees’ desks. Finisterre’s aim, says Kay, part hippy, part focused businessman, is to connect people with the sea. “We believe that they experience better wellbeing, better health, better spirituality, mental space,” he says. Once a week at Finisterre, staff start an hour late so they can participate in Sea Tuesday – getting wet in whatever way floats their boat, board or body. “Hopefully, there comes with that a ship, realising the importance of looking after the sea.”After all, what the sea gives us, we seldom give back. David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II kickstarted a nationwide battle against the single-use plastics clogging the oceans. Surfers have an intimate relationship with the water, but the damage they do goes under-reported. Wetsuits are made of neoprene, a synthetic rubber originally invented to line landfill sites: good for staying warm while surfing in December, less so for the environment. Finisterre estimates 380 tonnes of wetsuit waste ends up dumped every year. Eighteen months ago, Kay decided to do something about it. Wetsuits from Wetsuits is Finisterre’s mission to create the world’s first fully recyclable wetsuit, and to pioneer the means of recycling any old suit.Finisterre already uses a biodegradable rubber in its suits. It makes clothes from Econyl, a recycled nylon made from discarded fishing nets and carpet tiles. Fully recyclable wetsuits are the next step. “We have an outlook to do something about these problems if we can,” says Kay. “We’re very much involved in solving these problems in innovation.”Finisterre hired what Kay believes is the world’s only full-time wetsuit recycler to help the company look for sustainability solutions. Jenny Banks is a graduate of the material futures MA at Central Saint Martins in London. Normally, at the start of such a project, she says, you would spend a year reviewing existing research. “But it’s been so hard to find information,” she says. “We’ve got one or two papers on testing wetsuit properties and construction, and a lot of those testing standards are military standards from the 50s when they started making ing suits.”It is possible that the knowledge is “kept within the walls” of the main suppliers, she says. Or that there has not actually been much wetsuit innovation since the San Diego physicist Hugh Bradner invented them in 1952. “There’s a reason why we still use the materials that we use in nonrecyclable wetsuits today,” says Banks. “They are pretty brilliant.”Conventional wetsuits can contain as many as 15 different materials that are nearly impossible to separate at the end of a suit’s life. Finisterre’s plan was to design a suit made of a limited number of materials to maximise the quality of rubber and other material that could be recovered in the recycling process. So Banks started chopping up standard suits and testing the constituent parts for stress and durability. “Fabrics are great for meaning the foam doesn’t overstretch, but the fabrics make recycling really hard. That was the starting point of the redesign – asking: how do we still make the foam strong, but make it recyclable?”One solution was using a “skin finish” – a texturised biodegradable rubber that prevents water from getting trapped in the fabric and chilling the wearer. But it is controversial, and not for its environmental impact. “Skin finishes were used in the 70s and it’s seen as a very retro thing,” says Banks. “There are a few small brands that still use it as a style point – some people love it and some people hate it. You’re balancing style and sustainability …”But the prototype that Kay shows me at Finisterre’s office looks sharp: the skin finish appears technical in an on-trend way. It is a men’s suit because women’s are harder to cut. He has tested it out in the water and, even designed as a 3mm-thick summer suit, it is a bit warm, and not that easy to get on and off. He has me stick an arm down a sleeve, which is sticky – removing a wetsuit at the best of times can be a pretty undignified battle. Still: “This is the most recyclable suit out there in the world, pretty much,” Kay says proudly. “It’s got no laminate on it, you can take the stitching out and then the theory is that it can be totally recycled.”There is still a lot more testing to go – next, Kay and other testers will wear the suit with temperature sensors for a more precise assessment of the heat situation.This is the “upstream” element of Wetsuits from Wetsuits: the creation of a product that can be recycled. “Downstream is when the product has gone through the hands of the customer and is about to go to landfill,” says Kay. Here is where another, chemical recycling process comes in. Kay discovered ReNew ELP, a hydrothermal plant in Australia that uses catalytic thermo-hydrolysis to break down any old wetsuits and marine waste from Sydney’s beaches into a bio-crude. When Finisterre put out a call for old suits to send to Australia, it got 100 in two days.Banks admits that this discovery may make Finisterre’s recyclable wetsuit seem redundant. But the more materials go into the bio-crude, the more that need distilling afterwards, which is expensive. “By simplifying the materials within our suit,” she says, “we maximise the amount of good quality, pure material we can recover and reintroduce into our wetsuit manufacturing.”Obviously, these processes also have an environmental impact. “We’re trying to find a partner to do a life-cycle assessment to find out what the balance is between the environmental impact of the recycling and the environmental impact of making them from virgin,” says Banks.By talking about this, Finisterre is giving away the company secrets. But that is the point. Other surf brands “won’t do it because it’s a nice thing to do, or the right thing to do,” says Kay. “But they will do it when you can prove an economic case. The innovation around the future of business growth has to be waste as a resource. If you can prove that you can get the bio-crude out of the plant in Australia, and that’s saving half of the raw material cost at the start, suddenly there’s an economic argument for it. If we as a brand could prove that change is possible, that’s something I’m really excited about, and really gunning for.”Wetsuits from Wetsuits was initially conceived and funded as a two-year programme, which would theoretically end in November, but Banks says it is realistically a five-year plan that needs support from the big guns. “At the end of these two years, it’ll be about presenting the prototype, the information from our wetsuit testers and the lab, and saying, this is totally feasible, let’s do this together. We’re a tiny brand in the whole scheme of the wetsuit industry. The next phase would be about partnership and collaboration, and building up enough momentum from the wetsuit industry to put pressure on the supplier to make that change.”Finisterre is not yet profiting from the programme, and once it hits the market it will have to persuade customers to spend more. Kay notes the growing awareness around the climate emergency, but says he does not think most people will splash out on sustainability. “So that’s the challenge: getting proof of concept, testing this first recycled wetsuit out, and then starting to think about the economic viability.”It has taken longer than Kay and Banks thought it would to get here, but both sound irrepressibly enthused about what is still to come.“We could have waited for one of the bigger wetsuit brands to figure this all out, but we didn’t, which I think is testament to how dedicated we are to our ethos of looking after our environment and bringing about positive change,” says Banks. At any rate: the joy of surfing lies in never tiring of the pursuit of perfection, so their temperaments are well suited to their mission."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99cf0fb021ce869d8c682be56663bf98cb5d46e1/0_260_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e98232f77da20a1d251e71c77b95f26e","title":"venice cruise ships could be rerouted from city centre next month","story":"Italian minister proposes plan for erting a third of big ships to other ports by next yearItaly’s transport minister has proposed a plan for erting massive cruise ships from Venice’s historic centre, with a view to rerouting a third of the vessels by next year.Danilo Toninelli told a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday that the ships could gradually be shifted away from the Marittima terminal and instead dock at Fusina, a small port on mainland Venice, or Lombardia, a privately owned terminal. The minister suggested that the rerouting process could begin in September.Toninelli has been under pressure to come up with a solution after four people were injured when the 13-deck MSC Opera crashed into a wharf and tourist boat along the busy Giudecca Canal, the main thoroughfare that leads to St Mark’s Square, in early June. Weeks later the 12-deck Costa Deliziosa narrowly missed colliding with a yacht during a storm.The incidents have revived protests against big ships and calls from residents to ban them from the Venice lagoon altogether.Toninelli previously suggested erting cruise liners to Chioggia, a port south of Venice. But a final decision would need to be made by a committee that includes the transport ministry and local and regional authorities.“These are Toninelli’s hypotheses … no official solution has been decided,” said a source at Venice council.Nicola Ussardi, a member of the No Big Ships activist group, said: “There’s a lot of chaos surrounding the issue in general. But these are just declarations, nothing official.”Toninelli, from the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, clashed with Venice leaders after he dismissed a solution agreed by the committee in 2017 without consulting them. The Venice mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, and Luca Zaia, the president of the Veneto region, have also been excluded from discussions about alternative proposals."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Police officer knocked unconscious after youth threw something at himMost emergency accommodation in Dublin 1, Dublin 7 and Dublin 8Diver taken to Galway facility after falling ill on return to surface off coast of KinsaleTender process to commission polling company to select 99 voters on electoral registerReport proposes a major shift towards vegetarian and vegan dietsGroup says picture painted of \u0026lsquoconservative backward YFG\u0026rsquoChanges to farming and eating habits among measures required to tackle emergencyRise in subscriptions due to \u0026lsquoongoing market stability\u0026rsquoBlustery, rainy conditions, showers and possible spot flooding expected at weekendExpenses claimed since 2015 yet Senator\u0026rsquos site \u0026lsquonews section\u0026rsquo last updated two years agoAcademics say use of electronic devices is difficult to police in crowded exam hallsHis insights and equations are fundamental to weather forecasting, climate modelling etcDocuments shows public displeasure at jailing of Sutton GP Dr Bassam Naser for tax evasionPatients waiting six months told they are HPV negative when actually HPV positiveMajority of messages received by department seek harsher punishment of criminalsNBCI investigating claims inspector worked as security consultant for Coolmore StudRight-wing conservative youth group says Foley-Walsh was at the conference in a \u0026lsquopersonal capacity\u0026rsquoOireachtas committee report raises concerns about multibillion-euro roll-out"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3979891.1565207172!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"keith byrne to invoke john lennon in us deportation case","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKeith Byrne was arrested by Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officials last month and spent two weeks in prison, under a Trump-ordered crackdown on illegal immigration.Lawyers for Irishman Keith Byrne, threatened with deportation from the US over a charge for possessing cannabis in Ireland 14 years ago, plan to invoke John Lennon before federal courts in an attempt to secure his residency. Joe Hohenstein, one of the Corkman’s legal team, said the ex-Beatle’s threatened deportation in the 1970s was over “exactly the same charge” which has hampered Mr Byrne’s struggle for a green card.In 1972, US president Richard Nixon’s White House ordered Lennon – who had been living in New York with his wife Yoko Ono for a year at the time – out of the country. It was an election year, and the famous couple were outspoken in their protest against the Vietnam War, urging people to give peace a chance by voting Nixon out of office. Lennon’s charge for cannabis possession in London in 1968 was cited by the Nixon administration as reason for his being improperly allowed into the US. After a three-year fight against deportation proceedings, a three-judge federal panel ruled his conviction in Britain didn’t meet American standards of justice.A year later, he won permission to remain on as a permanent resident. Embarrassment“The British version of marijuana possession is identical to the Irish version,” said Mr Hohenstein. “That is – even under the current US immigration law – not something that should make someone what we call inadmissible. “That is one of the main things we will be trying to bring home when we file these papers in court.”Mr Byrne said the minor cannabis charge 14 years ago in his hometown of Fermoy, Co Cork, was the “big issue”. “We have been trying to correct it and find the right person to hear our argument,” he told RTÉ’s Drivetime. “I’m embarrassed for the government of Ireland and the government of the United States for something like that to ruin my life, my wife’s life, my children’s lives. “People are out there doing serious crimes and they can go wherever they please. It is horrendous . . . Why should that ruin my future?”Mr Byrne (37), who lives in Philadelphia, was arrested by Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officials last month and spent two weeks in prison, under a Trump-ordered crackdown on illegal immigration. The father-of-three overstayed his ESTA visa waiver when he entered the country in 2007 and married his American wife Keren two years later. His attempts to regularise his residency ever since were complicated by the cannabis possession charge.Two applicationsMr Hohenstein said he would be filing two different court applications in the ongoing battle against deportation: one to a federal appeals court, on the removal of his deportation order another in a lower federal court, appealing the decision to deny Mr Byrne his green card. The lawyer said Mr Byrne had put his wife Keren through nursing school, helped her build a career as a registered nurse and that their family connections in the US are “extremely strong”. The US immigration system deals very “severe and harsh consequences for minor incidents” which have a “really disproportionate impact on inidual persons and their US citizen families”, he said. But he believes the deportation efforts are the result of a “misunderstanding” and that Mr Byrne’s “interaction with the authorities in Ireland do not make him inadmissible in the US.”Mr Byrne said he was “giving no energy” to the thought of having to leave the US. “I don’t want to think about something that may never happen,” he said. “I will think of that when I’m on a plane. Right now, I’m thinking of how I can stay here and continue.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3980477.1565259134!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"n%C3%B3ra quoirin search local trackers and special forces deployed","story":"15-year-old Nora Quoirin\u0027s aunt Éadaoin Agnew appeals for help in locating her niece, who went missing while on a family holiday in Malaysia.

Photograph: Lai Seng SinAPMalaysian search-and-rescue teams have been using local trackers and members of special forces in their continued efforts to find missing Franco-Irish 15-year-old Nóra Quoirin.They are scouring the jungle in Negeri Sembilan for a fifth day as her family said they were “completely overwhelmed” by the support they had received from all over the world.The Malaysian authorities have been criticised in the past for inaction and even incompetence in the case of a missing person - Malaysian-born Australian citizen Annapuranee Jenkins - but, in the case of Nóra Quoirin’s disappearance, about 250 search-and-rescue personnel have been deployed and about twenty people have been interviewed.Divers have been scouring a nearby river, and drones and a helicopter have been deployed in the search effort. The family expressed their deepest gratitude to the Royal Malaysian Police, the search-and-rescue teams, and the emergency services “for all they have done for us in this difficult time”.Indigenous Orang Asli are helping to scour the forest in the search for the schoolgirl, and expert trackers from the Senoi Praaq special unit, which is made up mainly of Orang Asli, have been called in to assist.The Senoi Praaq special forces were created by the British colonial authorities in 1956 as a crack unit to fight communists during the Malayan Emergency and members of the unit are legendary for their tracking skills.While the Malaysian police continue to say the case of Nóra’s disappearance is officially that of a missing person, and that there is no evidence of foul play, they have said they are ruling nothing out.Nóra’s relatives say they believe that she has been abducted and insist that she is not someone who would have wandered off alone in the middle of the night.Initial reports that a window in Nóra’s bedroom was opened have been corrected by the deputy police chief for Negeri Sembilan, Che Zakaria Othman, who has confirmed that it was a window downstairs that was left open, and not the one in the upstairs bedroom occupied by Nóra.Sniffer dogs have not picked up any trace of Nóra other than in the immediate vicinity of the guest house the Quoirin family booked for a two-week holiday.The Star in Malaysia reported in an exclusive on Thursday that the total number of people reported lost in the Malaysian jungle so far this year is significantly higher than in each of the past three years.Hundreds missingFire-and-Rescue Department operations ision director, Abdul Wahab Mat Yasin, was quoted as saying that, in the first seven months of this year, there were 252 cases of people reported missing in the jungle.There were 191 cases in 2016, 219 in 2017, and 217 in 2018.Abdul Wahab said that, in 2018, all the missing persons were found, whereas two of those who went missing this year had not been tracked down.The case of the disappearance of Annapuranee Jenkins, who went missing in Penang on December 13th, 2017, is still unsolved. Jenkins had taken an Uber and was due to visit her 101-year-old mother in a care home, but got out of the Uber ahead of her destination and has been missing ever since.Jenkins’ relatives accused the police of inaction.

Photograph: AP PhotoNeil Armstrong, NASALast month marked the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong’s walk on the moon. The sciences of the 20th century allowed humans unprecedented access to a celestial object that has fascinated humankind for as long as we have written records. Armstrong trod on a surface that many before him had speculated about. If you are curious about the moon landing of Apollo 11, I encourage you to look at NASA’s excellent website about the mission (nasa.gov).The anniversary also provides an opportunity to reflect on past understandings of the moon’s surface before any human imagined it might be possible to walk on it.As Armstrong stretched his moon boot towards the lunar surface he was not surprised to find it solid and irregular. Satellites orbiting earth had photographed the surface of the moon, and scientists had named some of the most significant craters. Only a few centuries before Galileo had risked ridicule when, based on telescopic observations, he suggested that the moon’s surface was not smooth.Galileo’s drawings of craters on the moon were revolutionary because of the persistence of ideas about celestial objects. During the middle ages and the Renaissance, most people who considered the nature of the moon assumed that it was a perfect sphere with a smooth surface. Because the moon existed in the heavenly realm, above the earthly one, most people (astronomers included) believed that it must be perfect. This belief was based on the writings of Aristotle, who had also established the geocentric view of the universe. Aristotle’s perfect celestial bodies and earth-centered cosmos had also become key components of the Christian understanding of the universe. The moon was thought to be unlike earth in its perfection, existing in the realm of a perfect God.Nonetheless Galileo did not see perfection when he looked through his telescope at the moon in the early 17th century. He saw instead a surface that reminded him of earth. Others had explained the appearance of light and dark patches, or even the “man in the moon”, as the consequence of how the perfect crystalline substance of the moon reflected light. Galileo, however, saw mountains and valleys that looked terrestrial and not celestial. He noted how the shadows cast on the moon’s surface changed over the course of hours just as the shadows cast by mountains changed on the earth’s surface.PerfectionGalileo’s ideas soon appeared in artistic form. Only a year after the publication of Sidereus nuncius, the artist Lodovico Cigoli, in his commission for the Sancta Maria Maggiore chapel in Rome, chose to depict Mary standing upon a moon with Galileo’s pitted and pocked surface. This was significant for a number of reasons. Mary’s perfection and virginity had been associated with the pristine moon in religious commentary and in religious art. Further, Galileo would soon clash with the Church over his astronomical views and we might have expected objections to this new understanding of the lunar surface. Finally, Cigoli seems to have observed the moon’s surface himself through a telescope indicating the spread of Galileo’s ideas and practices of observation among some Italian elites.The moons drawn by Galileo in Sidereus nuncius would have appeared somewhat familiar to those astronauts embarking on the Apollo 11 mission. Although not drawn with perfect accuracy, Galileo’s large craters match up with those captured by lunar photography centuries later. He did not create a map of the moon’s surface and the moon was simply one of a number of examples of the possibilities for astronomical observation enabled by the telescope that he described in his book.Even before Galileo, two English astronomers had also begun to map the surface of the moon. Thomas Harriot’s observations of the lunar surface with a telescope had commenced in 1609, at least a year before Galileo’s. Harriot was less interested in the three-dimensional surface and more interested in sketching the boundaries of apparent land and oceans. Like Galileo, Harriot saw the moon as earth-like. William Gilbert also created a lunar surface map during the early 17th century.Harriot, Gilbert and Galileo had all expected that if the moon had a surface like the earth it would contain life like the earth. Such an expectation had disappeared by the time Neil Armstrong stepped out on to the moon but I wonder if the possibility might have crossed his mind, even for a second as he stepped out into the known unknown.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Comment: Labour moderates have given up the fight against the anarchy of John McDonnellVaccination rate in Germany dangerously low according to new studyUS resident dies after being deported by ICE to Iraq Italy\u0026#39s League calls for elections, saying coalition with Five Star Movement is no longer viableTate Modern: Teenager accused of throwing boy off viewing platform \u0026#39to be assessed by mental health experts\u0026#39Israel launches manhunt after off-duty soldier stabbed to death in West BankThe science behind the elbow war – what kind of human being hogs both armrests?Prince George cheers on mum and dad in Cowes regatta, but both Cambridges are beaten by Bear GryllsA ‘perfect storm’: the steady rise of dengue fever worldwideWhy Jeremy Corbyn won\u0026#39t be getting \u0026#39in a cab\u0026#39 to Buckingham Palace to make demands of QueenKnife crime soars in rural areas by as much as 50 per cent as violence epidemic spreads out of citiesBoardmasters music festival cancelled due to weather warningsComment: Cornered by Boris, Remainers have decided to stop at nothing in their war on BrexitLeader of Italian far-Right football hooligans shot dead in Rome parkComment: No-deal Brexit spells trouble for British expats in Europe Comment: Jeremy Corbyn will not stop no-deal, because he believes it\u0026#39s his only route to powerRecord July temperatures prompt A\u0026ampE chaos with tens of thousands languishing on trolleysFind the right newsletter for youTo win an election, Boris Johnson must forget freedom – people want security insteadWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"best telegraph audio inside fortnite world cup future fast food","story":"Every Friday the  will bring you a selection of our best articles, comment pieces and features in audio form to be listened to at your convenience.Following the new Prime Minister\u0027s visits to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Philip Johnston writes that a radical new plan might be required to keep the Union together.Kyle Giersdorf might not be a name many people know, but the 16-year-old gamer recently became £2.4m richer after becoming the Fortnite world champion.

were caught in an apparent attempt to use their outfits to steal dozens of items from a supermarket.The women were stopped by security guards at an Asda branch in Dagenham, East London, after being suspected of trying to leave with an estimated £200 worth of tins of baby formula hidden in their clothing.Video footage taken by a local shopper appeared to show one of the women taking items from what appeared to be a bag or pouch hidden under the long, black robe she was wearing after being confronted by security staff at the store last Saturday evening.Both women were wearing hijabs and black abayas, the headscarf and loose robe-like garment worn by some Muslim women.At one stage one of the woman pulls up the dress, revealing her tummy and underwear, in what appears to be an attempt to show she is not hiding any more items.Some of the items the women are alleged to have attempted to stealThe Asda employees can be seen covering their eyes and turning away as the woman walks towards the exit whilst holding up her black dress, leaving behind her a pile of around 20 discarded items. Her actions prompted several onlookers to question whether they were Muslim at all, with some saying no observant woman would either shoplift or expose herself in a similar manner. One Muslim mother of two shopping in the store on Wednesday told The :  “It’s not the first time it’s happened, where they dress up in abayas. It’s wrong and I\u0027ve seen it done before all around the world. It\u0027s wrong.Another shopper, who herself wears a hijab and abaya, wrote on Twitter: “If she’s Muslim or not she’s giving us Muslim women a bad light and if she is Muslim then may Allah guide her.”Another Twitter user, named only as Abdul, wrote: These people aren’t Muslim they’re those people who live in and around east London and have exploited the fact that it’s predominantly Muslims around here and to be honest Muslims are very generous people in giving towards charity and these frauds know this. Be aware everyone.”Security staff surround the two women at the Dagenham AsdaA senior Muslim community leader, who asked not to be named, told The : “It’s highly unlikely religious Muslim women would do this, but different Muslims do different things. If these women were Muslim and were attempting to shoplift they certainly should not be doing so. Both these acts, shoplifting and lifting up their dresses, go against what Muslims should be doing in the first place.”Asda staff did not immediately report the incident to the police, waiting until yesterday to do so, and the whereabouts of the two women are currently unknown.A spokesperson for Asda said: “We do not tolerate any form of shoplifting and work hard to deter shoplifters from our stores. “All cases of attempted theft are taken seriously and we always work closely with the local police force in the communities we serve. “We are in contact with Dagenham Police about this incident and would like to thank colleagues at our Dagenham store for their quick intervention and response in this case.”The politan Police said its officers were investigating the incident but had made no arrests at this stage.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: “We are aware of footage circulating on social media of two females having been stopped by staff members at a commercial premises at Merrilands Crescent, Dagenham on suspicion of theft. “The incident occurred on Sunday, 4 August between 19:30hrs and 19:45hrs. The two suspects are suspected of having attempted to steal infant formula. The incident was reported to police at 13:22hrs on Wednesday, 7 August. At this early stage there have been no arrests.” Comment: Labour moderates have given up the fight against the anarchy of John McDonnellVaccination rate in Germany dangerously low according to new studyUS resident dies after being deported by ICE to Iraq Italy\u0026#39s League calls for elections, saying coalition with Five Star Movement is no longer viableTate Modern: Teenager accused of throwing boy off viewing platform \u0026#39to be assessed by mental health experts\u0026#39Israel launches manhunt after off-duty soldier stabbed to death in West BankThe science behind the elbow war – what kind of human being hogs both armrests?Prince George cheers on mum and dad in Cowes regatta, but both Cambridges are beaten by Bear GryllsA ‘perfect storm’: the steady rise of dengue fever worldwideWhy Jeremy Corbyn won\u0026#39t be getting \u0026#39in a cab\u0026#39 to Buckingham Palace to make demands of QueenKnife crime soars in rural areas by as much as 50 per cent as violence epidemic spreads out of citiesBoardmasters music festival cancelled due to weather warningsComment: Cornered by Boris, Remainers have decided to stop at nothing in their war on BrexitLeader of Italian far-Right football hooligans shot dead in Rome parkComment: No-deal Brexit spells trouble for British expats in Europe Comment: Jeremy Corbyn will not stop no-deal, because he believes it\u0026#39s his only route to powerRecord July temperatures prompt A\u0026ampE chaos with tens of thousands languishing on trolleysFind the right newsletter for youTo win an election, Boris Johnson must forget freedom – people want security insteadWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/money/2019/08/05/TELEMMGLPICT000205153478_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6BstALpMiKOXM0sIUAWNCD_3gbhMIMw9636R-RLzic4.jpeg?imwidth=45","title":"british airways has gone national treasure national humiliation","story":"Nothing could have prepared me for this latest onslaught of travel misery A few weeks’ ago my twitching finger hovered over the mouse as I deliberated: should I book my holiday flight with British Airways, Easyjet or Icelandair?

Those tensions came to a head on Wednesday when they voted against each other in parliament over the future of a contested train link with France.Conte made no mention of resigning at the meeting with Mattarella, a government source said, prompting a partial market recovery. Conte himself declined to comment on the talks.At a rally late on Wednesday in Sabaudia, south of Rome, League Leader Matteo Salvini peppered his speech with hints that he might bring down the government, without giving a clear idea of what conditions he demanded to carry on.The spread between Italian benchmark bonds and safer German Bunds widened early on Thursday by 12 basis points, with traders citing reports that Salvini wanted to sack Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, who is well-regarded by investors.Conte cancelled a scheduled news conference, and a League source told Reuters that Salvini would make his position clearer by Monday.5-Star has more parliamentary seats than the League, but Salvini\u0027s party now has twice as much support, according to opinion polls, and it often issues thinly veiled threats to sink the government and try to trigger fresh elections.Italy could be heading to fresh elections after months of squabbling between the coalition partnersHowever, a government crisis in August, with Italians on holiday and parliament closed for the summer recess, would be unusual.Mattarella, who is the only person with the power to dissolve parliament, may also be unwilling to do so ahead of the preparatory work in September on the 2020 budget, which must then be presented to parliament the following month. Italy has not held an election in the autumn in all the post-war period.5-Star would probably have most to lose from new elections.Its leader Luigi Di Maio cancelled all his previously scheduled engagements on Thursday and accused Salvini of playing political games by seeking to obtain more cabinet ministers even though Salvini denies that is his goal.The League reiterated that it did not want a cabinet reshuffle and listed a raft of areas in which it had a different vision from 5-Star, including infrastructure, taxes, justice, regional autonomy and relations with the EU.Every day that passes is a day wasted, it said in a statement, citing the constant bickering between the two parties. For us the only alternative to this government is to give the choice back to the Italians with new elections.Wolfango Piccoli of political risk consultancy Teneo said the League\u0027s declarations should not be taken at face value.The most likely outcome is a cabinet reshuffle that will sanction the replacement of some M5S ministers with figures either from the Lega (League) or trusted by the party leadership, Piccoli said.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

I have my doubts,” he told BBC Radio 4.\u0026nbspHe added that in such a scenario supplies shouldn’t be directed just to supermarkets as a priority but to schools and hospitals as well.\u0026nbsp“We could be in a sort of wartime situation of a limited amount of food rationing… I don’t think we’ll get to that but I’m very concerned about the groups who aren’t in the supermarket chain, how they will deal with things. We have to prioritise – who can prioritise except the government itself?”If the waiver is granted allowing food producers to manage supply disruptions as a group, it will not do anything to stem rises in food prices. According to the FDF, prices will “inevitably” increase because trading under WTO rules will be more expensive and firms will also pass on to consumers the costs of preparing\u0026nbspfor a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe comments add to earlier warnings that a chaotic departure from the EU would lead to food shortages and higher prices.\u0026nbspMark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said last week food imports would be disrupted if Britain’s ports are not ready in time to handle a sudden surge in customs checks. He added that a no-deal Brexit would slash the value of the pound, immediately raising food prices.\u0026nbspAnd on Monday Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime. The public has so far been kept “largely in the dark” about the government’s view on the gravity of the situation that could unfold, he wrote in The Lancet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Competition law prohibits such cooperation.\u0026nbsp“We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year and, despite support from Defra, we’re still waiting,” Mr Rycroft said.Speaking to BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, he said shortages would affect “random” products, depending on “which trucks get through”, and that supplies would be disrupted for weeks or months after the Brexit date.\u0026nbspLord Haskins, former chair\u0026nbspof Northern Foods, agreed\u0026nbspfood shortages are likely if Britain crashes out of the EU, and warned of potential panic-buying which would exacerbate them.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Beer enthusiasts taste beer and ale during The Great British Beer Festival at Kensington Olympia in west London.

I have my doubts,” he told BBC Radio 4.\u0026nbspHe added that in such a scenario supplies shouldn’t be directed just to supermarkets as a priority but to schools and hospitals as well.\u0026nbsp“We could be in a sort of wartime situation of a limited amount of food rationing… I don’t think we’ll get to that but I’m very concerned about the groups who aren’t in the supermarket chain, how they will deal with things. We have to prioritise – who can prioritise except the government itself?”If the waiver is granted allowing food producers to manage supply disruptions as a group, it will not do anything to stem rises in food prices. According to the FDF, prices will “inevitably” increase because trading under WTO rules will be more expensive and firms will also pass on to consumers the costs of preparing\u0026nbspfor a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe comments add to earlier warnings that a chaotic departure from the EU would lead to food shortages and higher prices.\u0026nbspMark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said last week food imports would be disrupted if Britain’s ports are not ready in time to handle a sudden surge in customs checks. He added that a no-deal Brexit would slash the value of the pound, immediately raising food prices.\u0026nbspAnd on Monday Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime. The public has so far been kept “largely in the dark” about the government’s view on the gravity of the situation that could unfold, he wrote in The Lancet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

to decide where to prioritise shipments - they will have to provide cast-iron written reassurances that competition law will not be strictly applied to those discussions,” FDF\u0027s chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told the BBC.\u0026nbspIn the markets, Asian stocks were down on Wednesday while European bourses gained in morning trading.\u0026nbspDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has\u0026nbsppraised Donald Trump and his deputy Mike Pence for their warmth and enthusiasm for the UK-US relationship.\u0026nbspRaab says he was delighted to meet the pair on his three-day trip to the US in hope of paving the way for a post-Brexit trade deal.The UK looks forward to working with our American friends to reach a free trade deal that is good for both countries, and co-operating on the common security challenges we face.\u0026nbspE.On is the latest “Big Six” energy supplier to blame the government’s price cap for plummeting profits.The cap, which will be reduced this winter, is supposed to stop firms ripping off loyal customers.The German utility’s earnings from UK retail customers crashed 78 per cent in the latest quarter.Customer numbers fell by around 200,000 to 6.4 million in the three months to March.Bad news for E.On today but good news for about 15 million households who will see their energy bills fall this winter.\u0026nbspAnnual energy bills will go down by £75 on average for 11 million households on standard tariffs and by £25 for customers who pay for their gas and electricity upfront.\u0026nbspOfgem, the energy regulator for England, Wales and Scotland, is lowering the price caps for the October to March period due to lower wholesale energy prices.Full story here from Olesya Dmitracova:Energy bills to fall for 15 million households this winter as Ofgem lowers price capsExecutives at Hargreaves Lansdown will give up their bonuses after the Woodford fund fiasco, Reuters\u0026nbspis reporting.\u0026nbspAccording to the nes agency\u0027s source, Hargreaves\u0027 chief executive Chris Hill, Chief financial officer Philip Johnson, chief investment officer Lee Gardhouse and research director Mark Dampier, will take no bonus for 2019.\u0026nbspHargreaves plugged Woodford\u0027s fund through its best buy list and received fees for referring customers.\u0026nbspHundreds of thousands of Hargreaves Lansdown customers who ploughed their savings into Woodford\u0027s flagship fund have had their money frozen since June and it will likely stay there until at least December as the once highly regarded stock picker tries to sort out the mess he is in.\u0026nbspWoodford invested in riskier unlisted stocks which he couldn\u0027t get rid of fast enough when a long run of poor performance prompted people to demands their cash back.House prices have fallen for the second successive month, Halifax says.The average UK house price was down 2 per cent in July to\u0026nbsp£236,120 following a 0.4 per cent monthly decline in June.However, the lender said prices were still up 4.1 per cent in the year to July.Brexit uncertainty will weigh on the UK housing market over the next few months according to analysts at the EY ITEM Club.\u0026nbspConsumers may well be particularly cautious about committing to buying a house, especially as house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes, says Howard Archer.\u0026nbspHouse prices are still far higher compared to earnings than the average over the last 35 years.\u0026nbspAccording to the Halifax, the house price to earnings ratio was still as high as 5.59 in July after spiking to 5.72 in February (the highest level since November 2017) from 5.39 in January this is well above the long-term (1983-2019) average of 4.29.\u0026nbspAnd it is questionable whether recent growth in jobs numbers and earnings can be sustained months as companies tailor their behaviour to a lacklustre domestic economy, prolonged Brexit uncertainties and a challenging global environment.\u0026nbspTherefore Archer forecats\u0026nbspthat house prices will rise by no more than 1.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTesla is in a spot of bother in the US.\u0026nbspBloomberg\u0026nbspreports that Elon Musk\u0027s firm has been scrutinised over safety claims on its Model 3 the car intended to take electric vehicles truly into the mainstream.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspNational Highway Traffic Administration reportedly sent a cease and desist letter last year, taking issue with Tesla\u0027s\u0026nbspclaim that the Model 3 had achieved the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle the agency ever tested.So, what exactly is Britain\u0027s food industry saying it needs the government to do to prevent food shortages after Brexit?\u0026nbspIt\u0027s trade body wants firms\u0026nbspto be allowed\u0026nbspco-ordinate and direct supplies with each other if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October.\u0026nbspThey cant do that under current rules which prevent them colluding. Those\u0026nbspmeasures are designed to ensure adequate competition and result in the best outcome for consumers.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said: “We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year, but we\u0027re still waiting.”\u0026nbspThe industry says that an October Brexit would be disastrous for food supplies because warehouses are already full in the run-up to Christmas.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne retailer told the BBC that 31 October\u0026nbsp“is about the worst day you can pick”, as warehouse capacity is at 105 per cent\u0026nbspin November, versus 75 per cent - 80 per cent\u0026nbspin March.The government isn\u0027t being entirely up-front about the potentially dire consequences of no-deal Brexit for fresh food and drink supplies, according to a leading academic on the topic.\u0026nbspTim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned earlier this week that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime.\u0026nbspWhat does that mean?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\tThe government estimates that half of lorries entering the country will be unable to cross the border smoothly\tThe flow of trucks could drop by a third within a day of a no-deal Brexit\tFood prices predicted to rise by more than 10 per cent as costs rise and supplies fall.Professor Lang warns\u0026nbspthat Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, already under-consume fresh fruit and vegetables, and food banks are not fully prepared for shortages, which could have a negative impact on diets and public health.\u0026nbspFull story here:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit food shortages: Government being secretive over public health risks of no dealThousands of holidaymakers have had their flights cancelled due to more technology failures at British Airways.\u0026nbspSimon Calder has counted\u0026nbsp86 cancellations to and from Heathrow so far today, including one round-trip to New York and dozens of flights to Mediterranean resorts.

Unfortunately, even the food industry, which has tested a range of options to mitigate the effect of massive disruption at Dover, doesn\u0027t really know.\u0026nbspFood and Drink Federation boss Tim Rycroft tells the BBC:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere will be selective shortages and they will to some extent be random because it depends on which trucks get through and which don\u0027t. We think there will be some serious disruption and it will go on for weeks or months after our exit.The government is unlikely to grant the food industry\u0027s wish for\u0026nbsprelaxed rules to alleviate food supply problems, says Mark Jones, partner at law firm Gordons. Big supermarkets\u0026nbspprobably won\u0027t\u0026nbspbe on board either.Jones says: “The ‘big four’ control almost 70 per cent\u0026nbspof the market and if any of them have a supply chain advantage post-Brexit, it offers them an opportunity to gain market share, says Jones.\u0026nbspI cannot see them wanting to help their competitors. They will want to help their own customers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“As to suppliers, if they can sell the stock they have, they will, and they may well be able to make a better profit if supply is tight. \u0026nbspIf they cannot sell or use their raw materials, there is nothing stopping them picking up the phone to their competitors and selling raw materials now. \u0026nbspRelaxing rules on anti-competitive behaviour is, in my view, unlikely to help shortages and I cannot see the Government going for it.”\u0026nbspThe pound is a quarter of a per cent lower against the dollar so far today at $1.2137, not far off the 31-month low of $1.2080 it hit last week.\u0026nbspAgainst the euro, sterling is down 0.1 of a cent, leaving it slightly above the 23-month low reached yesterday.\u0026nbspWith little to look out for on the economic calendar, Connor Cambell, financial analyst at Spreadex, predicts markets will remain incredibly susceptible to the minutiae of the trade war and comments from Donald Trump.Twitter has revealed it may have used some people\u0027s personal data to target them with advertising without their permission because of issues within the platform\u0027s settings, the\u0026nbspPress Association\u0026nbspreports.The social media giant said it had recently discovered issues in its website where settings choices may not have worked as intended, resulting in some gathered data being used to personalise advertising.Twitter said it fixed the issues on 5 August.In a blog post discussing the problems, Twitter detailed how, in one case, data may have been shared with advertisers despite not receiving user permission to do so.Donald Trump\u0027s trade war with China has pushed oil prices to a new seven-month low as the outlook for the global economy looks increasingly bleak.\u0026nbspBrent crude is down 0.6\u0026nbspper cent to $58.31.\u0026nbspThe US president attacked Beijing this week for allegedly manipulating its currency to make Chinese exports more competitive.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe UK government is yet to respond to a request by the food industry to waive parts of competition law so that companies can cooperate after a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspto mitigate\u0026nbspfood shortages.\u0026nbspFull story from business and economics editor Olesya Dmitracova here:\u0026nbspBrexit: UK food industry asks for rule waiver to tackle food shortages after no-dealOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This can be damaging, not only to the share price, but also to investor confidence.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

and the public - want to avoid.\u0026nbspMPs are considering a bid to cancel the annual autumn recess set aside for party conferences in a fresh attempt to prevent Boris Johnson ploughing ahead with a no-deal Brexit, our political correspondent Ashley Cowburn reports.\u0026nbspBrexit: MPs considering bid to ‘cancel autumn recess’ to stop Halloween no-dealSome better news today in stock markets that have suffered recently from fears surrounding an escalating trade war between the US\u0026nbspand China.\u0026nbspThe major indices edged up on the back of\u0026nbspsurprise news that Chinese exports rose 3.3 per cent in July, despite rising tariffs imposed by Donald Trump\u0027s administration.\u0026nbspImports were also up suggesting China is showing signs of resilience.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp- Japan\u0027s Nikkei 225 up 0.37 per cent to 20,593.35.\u0026nbsp- Hong Kong\u0027s Hang Seng up 0.5 per cent to 26,120.77\u0026nbsp- Germany\u0027s Dax up 0.5 per cent to 11,712.12\u0026nbsp- France\u0027s CAC 40 up 1 per cent to 5,317.74\u0026nbsp- FTSE 100 up 0.14 per cent to 7,208.62What would the economy look like after a no-deal Brexit with\u0026nbspone\u0026nbsppound worth less than one dollar?\u0026nbspPretty dreadul, according to Silvia Dall’Angelo, Senior Economist at Hermes Investment Management:\u0026nbspA sharp currency depreciation would act as a supply-side shock, driving a spike in inflation, a squeeze on income and a drag on consumption. Savings would fail to provide an ample buffer as consumers have already dissaved significantly since the EU referendum. In fact, the saving rate is running close to its record low levels.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBusiness investment may also slow further as a falling pound with potential for further depreciation could spook investors. Furthermore, the benefit of rising exports usually associated with a weaker currency has not yet been felt by UK businesses, which suggests we may see little boost to exports from a weak pound.\u0026nbspLooking beyond pound v dollar, things are even worse for the pound.\u0026nbspAgainst a trade-weighted basket of major currencies, sterling hit a 33-month low on 30 July\u0026nbspSterling’s recent tumble suggests that a no-deal Brexit could take the pound into uncharted territory, says\u0026nbspSilvia Dall’Angelo, Senior Economist at Hermes Investment Management.\u0026nbspAgainst the dollar, that could mean $1.05 to $1.10 but, Given the tendency for financial markets to overshoot, no-deal Brexit could easily push the pound to parity with the dollar which has never happened before.\u0026nbspShe adds:\u0026nbspGoing forward, there is scope for wider ranges of value for the pound, including the possibility of an increase if MPs are able to successfully block a no-deal Brexit in Parliament, but realistically, the next few months don’t hold much promise for the currency. \u0026nbspSeptember and October could be wildly volatile months for sterling.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Morgan hit 17 sixes and set a new record in one-day international cricket, which saw his side win by 150 runsEconomists agree that the housing market will suffer if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.\u0026nbspThe government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), forecast last month that house prices would tumble by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021. The slide could be even steeper as the OBR’s prediction was based on the assumption of a particular type of no-deal Brexit – the less disruptive of the two laid out by the IMF earlier this year.Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item\u0026nbspClub, forecasts a similar decline, saying house prices would quickly fall by about 5 per cent as the economy weakened and the market was mired in acute uncertainty over Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU.For now, house prices look on track for hardly any growth over this year.\u0026nbspAccording to RICS, a net balance of 9 per cent of respondents reported a fall in average prices over the past three months in England and Wales. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result is consistent with the official measure of prices showing a rise of only 0.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbspHalifax data also showed that UK house prices dropped slightly in July for the second consecutive month and now stand at £236,120 on average.“The market continues to tread water,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.\u0026nbsp“In the longer term, we believe there is unlikely to be a step change in market activity until buyers and sellers see some form of resolution to the current economic uncertainty.”RICS echoed this prediction, noting that its survey now points to zero growth in sales – as well as a steeper fall in prices – in the next three months.On Thursday Boris Johnson reiterated his trademark message that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October, even though no progress has been made on securing a withdrawal agreement acceptable to both sides.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

to decide where to prioritise shipments - they will have to provide cast-iron written reassurances that competition law will not be strictly applied to those discussions,” FDF\u0027s chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told the BBC.\u0026nbspIn the markets, Asian stocks were down on Wednesday while European bourses gained in morning trading.\u0026nbspDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has\u0026nbsppraised Donald Trump and his deputy Mike Pence for their warmth and enthusiasm for the UK-US relationship.\u0026nbspRaab says he was delighted to meet the pair on his three-day trip to the US in hope of paving the way for a post-Brexit trade deal.The UK looks forward to working with our American friends to reach a free trade deal that is good for both countries, and co-operating on the common security challenges we face.\u0026nbspE.On is the latest “Big Six” energy supplier to blame the government’s price cap for plummeting profits.The cap, which will be reduced this winter, is supposed to stop firms ripping off loyal customers.The German utility’s earnings from UK retail customers crashed 78 per cent in the latest quarter.Customer numbers fell by around 200,000 to 6.4 million in the three months to March.Bad news for E.On today but good news for about 15 million households who will see their energy bills fall this winter.\u0026nbspAnnual energy bills will go down by £75 on average for 11 million households on standard tariffs and by £25 for customers who pay for their gas and electricity upfront.\u0026nbspOfgem, the energy regulator for England, Wales and Scotland, is lowering the price caps for the October to March period due to lower wholesale energy prices.Full story here from Olesya Dmitracova:Energy bills to fall for 15 million households this winter as Ofgem lowers price capsExecutives at Hargreaves Lansdown will give up their bonuses after the Woodford fund fiasco, Reuters\u0026nbspis reporting.\u0026nbspAccording to the nes agency\u0027s source, Hargreaves\u0027 chief executive Chris Hill, Chief financial officer Philip Johnson, chief investment officer Lee Gardhouse and research director Mark Dampier, will take no bonus for 2019.\u0026nbspHargreaves plugged Woodford\u0027s fund through its best buy list and received fees for referring customers.\u0026nbspHundreds of thousands of Hargreaves Lansdown customers who ploughed their savings into Woodford\u0027s flagship fund have had their money frozen since June and it will likely stay there until at least December as the once highly regarded stock picker tries to sort out the mess he is in.\u0026nbspWoodford invested in riskier unlisted stocks which he couldn\u0027t get rid of fast enough when a long run of poor performance prompted people to demands their cash back.House prices have fallen for the second successive month, Halifax says.The average UK house price was down 2 per cent in July to\u0026nbsp£236,120 following a 0.4 per cent monthly decline in June.However, the lender said prices were still up 4.1 per cent in the year to July.Brexit uncertainty will weigh on the UK housing market over the next few months according to analysts at the EY ITEM Club.\u0026nbspConsumers may well be particularly cautious about committing to buying a house, especially as house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes, says Howard Archer.\u0026nbspHouse prices are still far higher compared to earnings than the average over the last 35 years.\u0026nbspAccording to the Halifax, the house price to earnings ratio was still as high as 5.59 in July after spiking to 5.72 in February (the highest level since November 2017) from 5.39 in January this is well above the long-term (1983-2019) average of 4.29.\u0026nbspAnd it is questionable whether recent growth in jobs numbers and earnings can be sustained months as companies tailor their behaviour to a lacklustre domestic economy, prolonged Brexit uncertainties and a challenging global environment.\u0026nbspTherefore Archer forecats\u0026nbspthat house prices will rise by no more than 1.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTesla is in a spot of bother in the US.\u0026nbspBloomberg\u0026nbspreports that Elon Musk\u0027s firm has been scrutinised over safety claims on its Model 3 the car intended to take electric vehicles truly into the mainstream.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspNational Highway Traffic Administration reportedly sent a cease and desist letter last year, taking issue with Tesla\u0027s\u0026nbspclaim that the Model 3 had achieved the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle the agency ever tested.So, what exactly is Britain\u0027s food industry saying it needs the government to do to prevent food shortages after Brexit?\u0026nbspIt\u0027s trade body wants firms\u0026nbspto be allowed\u0026nbspco-ordinate and direct supplies with each other if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October.\u0026nbspThey cant do that under current rules which prevent them colluding. Those\u0026nbspmeasures are designed to ensure adequate competition and result in the best outcome for consumers.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said: “We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year, but we\u0027re still waiting.”\u0026nbspThe industry says that an October Brexit would be disastrous for food supplies because warehouses are already full in the run-up to Christmas.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne retailer told the BBC that 31 October\u0026nbsp“is about the worst day you can pick”, as warehouse capacity is at 105 per cent\u0026nbspin November, versus 75 per cent - 80 per cent\u0026nbspin March.The government isn\u0027t being entirely up-front about the potentially dire consequences of no-deal Brexit for fresh food and drink supplies, according to a leading academic on the topic.\u0026nbspTim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned earlier this week that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime.\u0026nbspWhat does that mean?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\tThe government estimates that half of lorries entering the country will be unable to cross the border smoothly\tThe flow of trucks could drop by a third within a day of a no-deal Brexit\tFood prices predicted to rise by more than 10 per cent as costs rise and supplies fall.Professor Lang warns\u0026nbspthat Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, already under-consume fresh fruit and vegetables, and food banks are not fully prepared for shortages, which could have a negative impact on diets and public health.\u0026nbspFull story here:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit food shortages: Government being secretive over public health risks of no dealThousands of holidaymakers have had their flights cancelled due to more technology failures at British Airways.\u0026nbspSimon Calder has counted\u0026nbsp86 cancellations to and from Heathrow so far today, including one round-trip to New York and dozens of flights to Mediterranean resorts. A further 10 have been cancelled at Gatwick.\u0026nbspThe full report, including details on which flights have been grounded and what you can do if you\u0027re affected, here:\u0026nbspThousands of holidaymakers have had their flights cancelled and delayed\u0026nbsp due to systems failuresWorrying figures out today suggest\u0026nbspthat five million\u0026nbsppension\u0026nbspsavers could be susceptible to the common tactics used by scammers to steal retirement savings.\u0026nbspPresented with six common scam scenarios, two-fifths of 45 to 65-year-olds said they would act in one or more ways which experts said could leave them exposed to fraud.\u0026nbspThe data comes from a poll by the Financial Conduct Authority and the\u0026nbspPensions Regulator.\u0026nbspPeople should be wary of warning signs such as: pension\u0026nbspcold calls, free\u0026nbsppension\u0026nbspreviews, claims of guaranteed high returns, exotic investments, time-limited offers, and promises of early access to cash.Back to potential food shortages after Brexit.\u0026nbspWhat can consumers\u0026nbspexpect? Unfortunately, even the food industry, which has tested a range of options to mitigate the effect of massive disruption at Dover, doesn\u0027t really know.\u0026nbspFood and Drink Federation boss Tim Rycroft tells the BBC:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere will be selective shortages and they will to some extent be random because it depends on which trucks get through and which don\u0027t. We think there will be some serious disruption and it will go on for weeks or months after our exit.The government is unlikely to grant the food industry\u0027s wish for\u0026nbsprelaxed rules to alleviate food supply problems, says Mark Jones, partner at law firm Gordons. Big supermarkets\u0026nbspprobably won\u0027t\u0026nbspbe on board either.Jones says: “The ‘big four’ control almost 70 per cent\u0026nbspof the market and if any of them have a supply chain advantage post-Brexit, it offers them an opportunity to gain market share, says Jones.\u0026nbspI cannot see them wanting to help their competitors. They will want to help their own customers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“As to suppliers, if they can sell the stock they have, they will, and they may well be able to make a better profit if supply is tight. \u0026nbspIf they cannot sell or use their raw materials, there is nothing stopping them picking up the phone to their competitors and selling raw materials now. \u0026nbspRelaxing rules on anti-competitive behaviour is, in my view, unlikely to help shortages and I cannot see the Government going for it.”\u0026nbspThe pound is a quarter of a per cent lower against the dollar so far today at $1.2137, not far off the 31-month low of $1.2080 it hit last week.\u0026nbspAgainst the euro, sterling is down 0.1 of a cent, leaving it slightly above the 23-month low reached yesterday.\u0026nbspWith little to look out for on the economic calendar, Connor Cambell, financial analyst at Spreadex, predicts markets will remain incredibly susceptible to the minutiae of the trade war and comments from Donald Trump.Twitter has revealed it may have used some people\u0027s personal data to target them with advertising without their permission because of issues within the platform\u0027s settings, the\u0026nbspPress Association\u0026nbspreports.The social media giant said it had recently discovered issues in its website where settings choices may not have worked as intended, resulting in some gathered data being used to personalise advertising.Twitter said it fixed the issues on 5 August.In a blog post discussing the problems, Twitter detailed how, in one case, data may have been shared with advertisers despite not receiving user permission to do so.Donald Trump\u0027s trade war with China has pushed oil prices to a new seven-month low as the outlook for the global economy looks increasingly bleak.\u0026nbspBrent crude is down 0.6\u0026nbspper cent to $58.31.\u0026nbspThe US president attacked Beijing this week for allegedly manipulating its currency to make Chinese exports more competitive.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe UK government is yet to respond to a request by the food industry to waive parts of competition law so that companies can cooperate after a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspto mitigate\u0026nbspfood shortages.\u0026nbspFull story from business and economics editor Olesya Dmitracova here:\u0026nbspBrexit: UK food industry asks for rule waiver to tackle food shortages after no-dealOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But there were two technologies that were notably absent from the Unpacked event.Neither Samsung\u0027s virtual assistant Bixby nor VR compatibility for the Note 10\u0026nbspreceived a single mention during the nearly two-hour tech\u0026nbspshowcase. Both have been heavily hyped in recent years, but their quiet omission\u0026nbspsuggests they may no longer be central to Samsung\u0027s grander ambitions.Bixby has not been forgotten entirely, with both the Note 10 and Note 10+ supporting the virtual assistant. But Samsung\u0027s answer to Apple\u0027s Siri and Amazon\u0027s Alexa was not called upon or showed off during any of the product demos.At the same venue in 2018, Samsung unveiled the Bixby-supported Galaxy Home, which was designed to offer an alternative to other smart speakers like the Amazon Echo, Apple HomePod and Google Home. Not only has the device failed to launch in the 12 months that have since elapsed, Samsung also failed to provide any update on the beleaguered speaker.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

The summer before last, this plot would have been filled with the sound of 70 laying hens clucking as they roamed about, scratching at the weeds around the raspberries.As part of this hen-and-berry experiment, some canes had been fenced off. The chickens, like tiny bio-tractors, went about delivering nutrient-rich manure to the land around the other plants. The hens benefited from freedom and green space. And the raspberry canes they visited? They grew quicker and fruited earlier than the ones beyond the fence boundary. Even now, after nearly two years without chickens, they are still much better plants.Alas, this story doesn’t end quite so well for the hens. Their merry outdoor tramping proved too tempting for kites, buzzards and kestrels, and several were plucked right out of raspberry paradise and eaten up.Nevertheless, this experiment was worthwhile – it is an example of the mixed style of farming that could help our crops, farm animals and soils thrive.There is a word for this method and it’s buzzing across Britain’s fields: agroforestry. If you listen to The Archers, you’re probably thinking that you’ve heard about it on there. If you don’t, you’re probably thinking about how unbearable The Archers is.For the anti-Ambridge brigade, agroforestry is when farmers plant trees (or shrubs and bushes like raspberries) in their fields – and it can help solve many of the problems facing our farmers.Created with Sketch.Agroforestry at Eastbrook Farm Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Eastbrook Farm in Wiltshire has dozens of organic pigs. The farm is interested in moving them to rootle around under trees instead of fields, but they have to be among older, resilient trees whose roots are well established. The farm\u0027s Ben Raskin points to the pigs in Spanish and Portugese dehesa systems that are mixed in with cork and oak trees, feeding on the acorns. Cows enjoy the shade and shelter of trees – and munching on their leaves. The energy they save has been shown to increase the efficiency of dairy farming. The Soil Association says agroforestry increases milk production by 17 per cent, and reduces lamb mortality by 50 per cent. A neat row of almond trees at Eastbrook, in their fourth year of growth. As long as there is not a late frost, the blossom and nuts will do well. A climate-conscious diet may see Britons turn away from factory-farmed meat and towards plant protein – could homegrown almonds become a British staple? A moth sits on thistles that grow between the young trees. Agroforestry is great for wildlife – from the littlest critters to the birds and bees. Blackcurrants growing on the farm are used at the adjoining pub. Trees and shrubs can ersify farmers’ income streams. It may be more awkward to have to sell a variety of produce to different places, rather than only growing one crop for a supermarket, but if that one crop fails they could be more financially vulnerable. A ginkgo tree with a tag for monitoring and measuring growth and health. Gingkos have been found in fossils that are 270 million years old – meaning they evolved with the dinosaurs – and it is believed to be the oldest tree species. Gingko leaves and nuts are used herbal teas and medicines. It’s also interesting in that it has no tree species relatives. However, Ben says it isn’t particularly enjoying life on the farm… What looks like a jumble of weeds and grasses in fact tells a wonderful tale. These are young raspberry canes, which 70 chickens were allowed to peck around for several months. The birds tramped around on woodchip, stopping weeds germinating, and adding nutrients via manure. The canes developed noticeably more happily than the nearby ones that the chickens were penned off from – they grew quicker and fruited earlier than those without, and even now two years later are still the much better plants. However, some of the chickens were eaten by kites, buzzards and kestrels, so the system hasn’t quite proven itself just yet. A perry company is buying pears from Eastbrook. Apples and pear trees are trusted by farmers, whereas almonds and peaches are more exotic, with more unknowns. In a grassy 45-acre field, a large area has been fenced off. You can’t quite see the young willows that have been planted, for timber, but far in the distance, a few have excitedly shot up after a pile of woodchip was stored on them. Ben was not expecting this – but says the retained soil moisture and weedkilling properties must be responsible. Ben, who is encouraging farmers to branch out with their tree species, checks out the tag on a golden glow apricot tree. He says: “As a horticulturalist, I am of course excited to be pushing the boundaries a little and planting things like almonds and apricots in a location and system that probably hasn’t been tried before. However what really drives me is to explore the potential of the whole system. Will the timber trees do better with a coppiced alder next to them? Will our soil health improve? Can we demonstrate improved productivity of the whole farm as many agroforestry systems do?” Eastbrook Farm in Wiltshire has dozens of organic pigs. The farm is interested in moving them to rootle around under trees instead of fields, but they have to be among older, resilient trees whose roots are well established. The farm\u0027s Ben Raskin points to the pigs in Spanish and Portugese dehesa systems that are mixed in with cork and oak trees, feeding on the acorns. Cows enjoy the shade and shelter of trees – and munching on their leaves. The energy they save has been shown to increase the efficiency of dairy farming. The Soil Association says agroforestry increases milk production by 17 per cent, and reduces lamb mortality by 50 per cent. A neat row of almond trees at Eastbrook, in their fourth year of growth. As long as there is not a late frost, the blossom and nuts will do well. A climate-conscious diet may see Britons turn away from factory-farmed meat and towards plant protein – could homegrown almonds become a British staple? A moth sits on thistles that grow between the young trees. Agroforestry is great for wildlife – from the littlest critters to the birds and bees. Blackcurrants growing on the farm are used at the adjoining pub. Trees and shrubs can ersify farmers’ income streams. It may be more awkward to have to sell a variety of produce to different places, rather than only growing one crop for a supermarket, but if that one crop fails they could be more financially vulnerable. A ginkgo tree with a tag for monitoring and measuring growth and health. Gingkos have been found in fossils that are 270 million years old – meaning they evolved with the dinosaurs – and it is believed to be the oldest tree species. Gingko leaves and nuts are used herbal teas and medicines. It’s also interesting in that it has no tree species relatives. However, Ben says it isn’t particularly enjoying life on the farm… What looks like a jumble of weeds and grasses in fact tells a wonderful tale. These are young raspberry canes, which 70 chickens were allowed to peck around for several months. The birds tramped around on woodchip, stopping weeds germinating, and adding nutrients via manure. The canes developed noticeably more happily than the nearby ones that the chickens were penned off from – they grew quicker and fruited earlier than those without, and even now two years later are still the much better plants. However, some of the chickens were eaten by kites, buzzards and kestrels, so the system hasn’t quite proven itself just yet. A perry company is buying pears from Eastbrook. Apples and pear trees are trusted by farmers, whereas almonds and peaches are more exotic, with more unknowns. In a grassy 45-acre field, a large area has been fenced off. You can’t quite see the young willows that have been planted, for timber, but far in the distance, a few have excitedly shot up after a pile of woodchip was stored on them. Ben was not expecting this – but says the retained soil moisture and weedkilling properties must be responsible.

Can we demonstrate improved productivity of the whole farm as many agroforestry systems do?” Soil erosion is one of the most concerning. This happens when soil is washed and blown away by rain and wind. Some 3 million tons of topsoil are lost in the UK each year, according to the Campaign to Protect Rural England. And British soils may have only 100 harvests left, warn scientists from the University of Sheffield.\u0026nbspBut trees protect soil: their roots provide stabilising infrastructure, creating channels where water is held, while their bodies act\u0026nbspas wind-blockers. These factors will come in even more useful with the increasingly violent floods and storms caused by climate change. In a few decades’ time, we may be relying on agroforestry techniques just to ensure we can still feed ourselves.\u0026nbspThe roots of trees also dig deeper than crops, allowing them to bring up more nutrients\u0026nbsp – mainly nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium – from below. The nutrients spread to the leaves, which then fall on the soil and feed crops, if they are being grown alongside. This is nature’s fertiliser and could help farmers cut their pesticide costs as well as revitalise tired, one-crop fields.\u0026nbspEastbrook Farm in Wiltshire lets its organic pigs\u0026nbsprootle around under trees instead of fields\u0026nbsp(Emily Clark)Trees also provide habitats for wildlife down in the earth’s crust and above it – giving home to the birds, critters and insects that are in alarming decline in Britain, whose existence we depend upon for our ecosystem.And crucially, trees suck up carbon, which is why planting them is key to the government’s climate strategy. More and more, trees are hitting headlines as solutions to our climate crisis. The government advisers at the Committee on Climate Change say 30,000 hectares of woodland should be planted every year until 2050 to meet the UK’s goal of net zero carbon at that point. That’s 1.5 billion trees in total.Farmers have come to see trees as a problem rather than something of value. If you’ve got a big oak tree in the middle of your field, you don’t think, ‘It’s great to have a habitat for all the stuff around oak trees’, you think, ‘I’ve got to bloody drive round that in my plough’The committee, made up of science and business experts, adds that the 30,000 hectare figure may have to be revised up to 50,000 if other climate promises aren’t met.\u0026nbspLast year, England was 7 million trees short of the target for just 5,000 hectares, so there will have to be huge changes to keep us on track – putting agroforestry in the spotlight. It’s likely that the benefits of tree planting will align with the environment-focused farming subsidies that replace the EU payments after Brexit.There are still more benefits from farm trees – animals allowed to graze among them are given shade and shelter. This means they need less feed to keep warm or cool, and gives them a wider diet. The fruit, nuts, fuel logs or timber from trees and bushes then create another income stream for farmers.\u0026nbspWith all this, you would think farmers would be keen on agroforestry. But modern farming, which has crept up on us since the industrial revolution and inspired today’s chemical-soaked monocrops, has seen farmers become reluctant to keep hedges, bushes and trees.\u0026nbspMany tore these wilder spaces up so they could profit from crops instead – every inch of field matters when margins are tight. In our mad farming subsidy matrix, which encourages farming with yield-boosting pesticides, who could blame them? (Tearing out long farm hedgerows did become illegal in 1997.)Our version of capitalism has also created incentive to farm lots of one thing – high street chains and supermarkets want to make life easy for themselves by having fewer suppliers who can deliver bulk orders. But eventually, the huge monocrop fields that are fuelled on chemicals will become infertile, and what then?The good news is that, if done carefully, planting trees can boost productivity by up to a third, according to the Soil Association (SA). It can be done in an environmentally sustainable way that also makes financial sense.When cows munch on tree leaves, their\u0026nbspdiet is improved and tree growth is stimulated –\u0026nbspmulberry leaves are high in protein and willow bark has painkilling properties. Or when chickens trample down the weeds around young trees, they are stifling the competition. As with the hens and raspberries, animal manure then fertilises the soil – helping trees or crops grow.\u0026nbspFarmers were being paid to rip out hedges so that fields got bigger. As a result we’ve now got lots of really big fields, with nothing but one crop in it, which is actually quite a vulnerable, fragile position to be inBut before taking the risk of buying trees and rethinking their farm systems, farmers need sound advice to know what’s best for their animals or crops. There are a million agroforestry variations, and a million factors – soil type, tree species, choice of animal, grazing time, fencing, market demands, wind direction, labour costs, stubborn landowners… pass the paracetamol.\u0026nbspThis is a long game, and the financial stakes are high – it can take 10 to 15 years to establish a raspberry cane, and growing oak for timber can take 100 years.But there is advice out there. Ben Raskin, head of horticulture at the SA, is in his third year of testing out more than 20 tree species at Eastbrook Farm in Wiltshire – belonging to SA chief executive Helen Browning. He oversaw the raspberry and chicken combination, just one example of his many devious schemes.\u0026nbspHe’s particularly excited about growing almonds and apricots (now feasible thanks to global warming) in a location that hasn’t been tried before… in other words, California dreamin’. Raskin has now put together a handbook for farmers explaining how to move into agroforestry, produced by the SA and the Farm Woodland Forum.\u0026nbspHe says at least one farmer a week comes over to ask about his agroforestry experiments – four came the week before I visited, with 1,000 acres between them, and officials from Defra were booked in the following week.\u0026nbspRaskin\u0026nbspis encouraging farmers to branch out with the tree species they\u0026nbspchoose to plant\u0026nbsp(Emily Clark)Before showing me his neat rows of young trees including peach, pear, cherry and damson, he explains why this type of farming is blossoming in Britain – after 150 years of decline.\u0026nbsp“Long, long ago, farmers would have made quite a lot of use of trees, and hedgerows would have been quite productive,” he says. “They would have had fruit and nuts and they would have coppiced them for fuel.”As industrialisation took hold, and farmers began to specialise, the story changed. “We were getting bigger tractors and becoming more efficient at farming,” Raskin says, “so farmers were being paid to rip out hedges so that fields got bigger. As a result we’ve now got lots of really big fields, with nothing but one crop in it, which is actually quite a vulnerable, fragile position to be in.How small farms are leading the way towards sustainable agricultureFarming chief calls for ‘net zero’ agriculture emissions in UK by 2040‘Super crops’ could revolutionise agriculture in Africa, expert claims“Farmers have come to see trees as a problem rather than something of value, something that’s worth spending time on. If you’ve got a big oak tree in the middle of your field, you don’t think, ‘It’s great to have a habitat for all the stuff around oak trees’, you think, ‘I’ve got to bloody drive round that in my plough’. However, trees do bring a whole massive range of benefits to a farm.”\u0026nbspA lot of countries are way ahead of us on this, he says, including France, China, America\u0026nbspand tropical countries that never lost the art. In Spain and Portugal’s dehesa systems, pigs are mixed in with cork and oak trees, feeding on the acorns.\u0026nbspRaskin points to a few agroforestry operations in the UK – the Pontbren lamb project in Wales involving 10 farmers is one that has been a particular success. They realised during the Nineties that they were spending too much on feed and housing costs for their lambs. To keep the lambs outside for longer, they knew the animals would need more shelter – so they began planting thousands of trees.\u0026nbspTheir plans worked. But the farmers also realised that the woodland absorbed 60 times more water than pasture fields just 10 metres away. The trees they had planted in the wettest parts of Wales were a brilliant defence against flooding in other parts of the country.\u0026nbspThere were also fewer chemicals running into waterways from compacted soils on intensive farms. And better shelter is\u0026nbspknown to\u0026nbspreduce flock health issues, such as lameness or even death of the youngest lambs.But Raskin says there are still very few examples of agroforestry in the UK – and we’ve got to up our game.\u0026nbspWith the barrage of difficulties faced by our farmers, especially as Brexit uproots the subsidy system, they’re going to need all the help they can get. Trees might be the perfect way to branch out.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Savings would fail to provide an ample buffer as consumers have already dissaved significantly since the EU referendum. In fact, the saving rate is running close to its record low levels.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBusiness investment may also slow further as a falling pound with potential for further depreciation could spook investors. Furthermore, the benefit of rising exports usually associated with a weaker currency has not yet been felt by UK businesses, which suggests we may see little boost to exports from a weak pound.\u0026nbspLooking beyond pound v dollar, things are even worse for the pound.\u0026nbspAgainst a trade-weighted basket of major currencies, sterling hit a 33-month low on 30 July\u0026nbspSterling’s recent tumble suggests that a no-deal Brexit could take the pound into uncharted territory, says\u0026nbspSilvia Dall’Angelo, Senior Economist at Hermes Investment Management.\u0026nbspAgainst the dollar, that could mean $1.05 to $1.10 but, Given the tendency for financial markets to overshoot, no-deal Brexit could easily push the pound to parity with the dollar which has never happened before.\u0026nbspShe adds:\u0026nbspGoing forward, there is scope for wider ranges of value for the pound, including the possibility of an increase if MPs are able to successfully block a no-deal Brexit in Parliament, but realistically, the next few months don’t hold much promise for the currency. \u0026nbspSeptember and October could be wildly volatile months for sterling.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a human being. You’re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, Kill yourself. I realised I needed to restructure my life because it felt completely out of control. I knew immediately I needed to make music about it because I knew it was the only way I could survive it. It was the only way I could preserve my mental health and also tell the story of what it’s like to go through something so humiliating.”Created with Sketch.From beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor Swift Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

If my son was gay, he’d be gay. I don’t understand the question.”She added, “Rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male. I didn’t realise until recently that I could advocate for a community that I’m not a part of. It’s hard to know how to do that without being so fearful of making a mistake that you just freeze.

We\u0027ll demonstrate what we can do and then I think the Scottish people won\u0027t be interested in another referendum.But if they ever do come back, my view is you can\u0027t be in a situation where you block it.It comes as a recent poll by Lord Ashcroft\u0026nbspgave a lead for Scottish independence for the first time since 2017, with 52 cent of Scottish people in favour and 48 per cent against.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Morgan hit 17 sixes and set a new record in one-day international cricket, which saw his side win by 150 runsBut why is\u0026nbspScottish independence in the headlines again?The short answer is because of Boris Johnson’s arrival in Downing Street, shifting the government’s Brexit stance towards a no-deal departure.Mr Johnson has tried to put the preservation of\u0026nbspthe UK at the heart of his premiership, by visiting the devolved governments early and by describing himself as “minister for the union”.However, his visit to Edinburgh, where he was booed and jeered by protesters, seems to have done more harm than good.A shock\u0026nbsppoll, conducted in the wake of his trip, put backing for\u0026nbspScottish independence\u0026nbspat 46 per cent, with 43 per cent of voters against.Support for independence rose to 52 per cent, with 48 per cent against, when those who said they did not know how they would vote or said they would not vote were removed.The poll by Lord Ashcroft –\u0026nbspthe first to show a lead for Scottish independence since 2017 – had a major impact.Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, said it delivered a “phenomenal” boost for the independence movement, as Scotland was “dragged towards a no-deal Brexit”.While it is only one poll, the Ashcroft findings illustrate the growing threat to the union from a no-deal Brexit.By law, Scotland must seek the UK government’s approval to hold another referendum, as matters relating to the union of the United Kingdom are referred to Westminster.Majority of Scots back independence in shock poll after Johnson visitAfter the 2014 vote, Sturgeon\u0026nbspkept her troops at the top of the hill for some time.She eventually requested consent from Theresa May in March 2017, the day before the then-prime minister fired the starting gun on the Brexit process.May blocked the move, saying it was “not the time” for more constitutional upheaval. Sturgeon tried again in April 2019 but the request was again denied.In May, the Scottish government published a bill laying out the framework for a second independence referendum once it has been granted powers by Westminster.Using a similar framework to previous referendums, the bill would allow a new vote quickly as Holyrood would not need to pass another law. The question and the date would need parliamentary approval under the plan.If the referendum question were the same as in the 2014 poll,\u0026nbspthere would be no need for further testing by the Electoral Commission.There is a small majority for independence in the Scottish parliament, as the\u0026nbspScottish Greens would join the SNP to form a 68-strong bloc in the 129-seat parliament.All of the remaining Holyrood\u0026nbspparties are opposed to Scotland leaving the UK.The problem for Sturgeon is all her preparations hinge on getting the nod from Westminster – and that remains an unlikely prospect.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The slide could be even steeper as the OBR’s prediction was based on the assumption of a particular type of no-deal Brexit – the less disruptive of the two laid out by the IMF earlier this year.Howard Archer, economic adviser to the EY Item\u0026nbspClub, forecasts a similar decline, saying house prices would quickly fall by about 5 per cent as the economy weakened and the market was mired in acute uncertainty over Britain’s future trading relationship with the EU.For now, house prices look on track for hardly any growth over this year.\u0026nbspAccording to RICS, a net balance of 9 per cent of respondents reported a fall in average prices over the past three months in England and Wales. Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the result is consistent with the official measure of prices showing a rise of only 0.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbspHalifax data also showed that UK house prices dropped slightly in July for the second consecutive month and now stand at £236,120 on average.“The market continues to tread water,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax.\u0026nbsp“In the longer term, we believe there is unlikely to be a step change in market activity until buyers and sellers see some form of resolution to the current economic uncertainty.”RICS echoed this prediction, noting that its survey now points to zero growth in sales – as well as a steeper fall in prices – in the next three months.On Thursday Boris Johnson reiterated his trademark message that Britain will leave the EU on 31 October, even though no progress has been made on securing a withdrawal agreement acceptable to both sides.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I had to sleep at the bottom of their bed. I didn’t eat properly because I felt sick at the thought of everything that went on and was scared of him contacting me again.She adds: I dont feel safe when Deals out of prison... he could come out, go off the radar and try to hurt me - or worse, kill me. It’s happened before in other stalking cases so Im scared.Deals  past offences relate to other harassment and stalking incidents dating back to  - and Samantha fears more women could be targeted by the rapper when hes released.On one hand Im so happy hes away [again], but on the other hand Im like  weeks - really  He should get years after everything hes put me and the other girls through, she tells us.When he came out of prison the first time my anxiety went through the roof and I was in and out of the doctors and not sleeping.The beauty queens hellish ordeal started innocently enough.Wannabe star Deal - who goes by the stage name JAYD - added her on Facebook like hundreds of her other fans.I had a friend request on Facebook around June , but thought nothing of it, says Samantha, who was crowned Miss Poole  and Miss Dorset . I have lots of supporters, so I accepted it.Yet it soon became clear Deal wasnt an ordinary fan.He began besieging her with unwanted messages, shared pictures of her in a wedding dress with an engagement ring emoji, and bizarrely vowed to dedicate his BGT audition song to her.He also started turning up to events she was at - including SandFest music festival in Poole, Dorset, last July, where he asked the model for a photo together.He just appeared and tapped me on the shoulder, Samantha recalls.He said Hi Sam, its Jonathan Deal. I was like Oh hello, thinking in my head it was weird. Id never met him and for him to just turn up was really, really weird.She adds: I then got this message on Facebook: really nice to meet you.Obviously I replied, really nice to meet you too. I was being polite.The moment Samantha shared anything on Facebook, Deal would like or comment on it.Then last September, the rapper tried to gatecrash a VIP tent Samantha was in at the Bournemouth Air Festival - and posted a live blog on Facebook claiming he was in love with her.The same month, he turned up at the Miss England finals at Nottinghams prestigious Kelham Hall, where Samantha made the top  and was crowned Miss South Coast Charity Queen after attending more than  charity events in  months.It was here he disturbingly told people he was her boyfriend, before lunging in to kiss her backstage.I felt like a real-le princess that night, says Samantha, now a teaching assistant.I had a real diamond tiara on my head, worth £,, and I had a dress on that was stunning.She adds: Out the back, theres a little arch we walk through - Deal literally grabbed me and went to hug me and kiss my lips. I felt physically sick - his breath near mine made me shiver.It was a huge moment and he ruined it.Samantha managed to push her stalker off before fleeing to find her parents.But when she told them what had just happened, she was sickened to discover that Deal had been wandering around looking for her and had even tried to sit at her familys table to get close to her.They hadnt seen him [lunge at me] but I said, hes just tried to kiss me, she says.They said, the moment its finished, were leaving. We had to sneak out the back.Deal later told Samantha she only did well because the judges thought you were my girlfriend.And it wouldnt be the last time he confronted her.While Samantha blocked the stalker on Facebook straight after the Miss England final, she claims he later turned up at her work, pinned her against a wall and yelled: Unblock me! Unblock me!He also posted about her all over social media.Someone like myself who is always smiling and positive, [the harassment] caused me a lot of anxiety and stress, resulting in me having to go to the doctors a lot, Samantha says.I’ve been single over a year as I just haven’t been in the right headspace.It’s massively put me off going on and dating sites because I just don’t know who they and for all I know they could be him or people like him.Finally, after a three-month nightmare, the beauty queen reported Deal to police and he was arrested for his harassment campaign.But during the rappers court case, the model - who is also an ambassador for UK non-profit Help  Homeless Veterans - was distraught to learn that she was far from his only victim.I remember it so well, he was talking about his previous [ offences], she tells us.My dad grabbed my hand and I just cried in his arms in the courtroom.At this point I was adamant this guy is a sick freak.While Deal was out on bail, under strict conditions, Samantha says she rang police at all hours of the day in a state of terror, using a special panic phone shed been given.Dorset Police were absolutely incredible, they were at my beck and call, says Samantha, who became so stressed that she ended up on medication. I called them twice a day sometimes, panicking.She was relieved when, in February, Deal was finally caged for  weeks and handed an indefinite restraining order banning him from any form of contact with her, after he admitted harassment.But Samanthas stress ed only three months later when she discovered the con had been freed early, on May .Id felt so good knowing he was behind bars - there was no way he could stalk me or anyone near me - [but] after he was released I struggled, she says.I had a special doorbell fitted in my familys house. The doorbell rings and we can see whos at the door - andsomeone walks past the door we can see them.She adds: I was going round the house locking all the doors.Incredibly, on May , just four days after his release, Deal broke the terms of his restraining order by re-posting messages on Facebook relating to the Miss Dorset and Miss England contests Samantha had participated in.The rapper was hauled before Poole Magistrates Court last month, where he was convicted of two counts of breaching the order and sent back to prison for  weeks.But Samantha fears his short sentence means he could soon terrorise someone  - and has backed calls for a national stalking register to protect women from predators like Deal.The moment you come across Jonathan Deal, block him, she warns.Dont give him the time of day or a chance. Im that person who gave him a chance. I thought, Oh hes lovely, this will be OK. I should have blocked him a lot earlier.She adds: If there was a register, Deal would have been known and dealt with a lot quicker.Later this year, Stalking Protection Orders- backed by The Sun - will come into effect to help protect victims.More than one in five women and almost one in  men aged  to  have been victims of stalking since the age of , according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales.SPOs will prevent stalkers from contacting victims or approaching them through those around them - and will force them to register their name, address and any aliases they use.Offenders may also be banned from ­loitering near victims’ homes.A breach of the order will be punishable by up to five years behind bars.Today, while Deal languishes in jail, Samantha is looking ahead to the Miss Sovereign GB pageant - a contest that aims to empower girls and women while raising funds for charity.She decided to enter the pageant to help others and raise awareness of stalking - but is understandably taking a very dferent approach towards social media and her fans.I havent added anyone that I dont know recently and that is big for me, Samantha says. If I havent met you, you cant be on my Facebook. I need to know who you are.As for Deal, she adds that shell always worry about him.Someone like him doesnt give up - its sickening, she says.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

look for evidence of extraterrestrials in the UK, where should they go The Facebook plan to storm the American base to see them aliens began as a joke which is now being taken seriously — deadly seriously.Not only did Facebook pull down the page, the Air Force issued a chilling warning to potential raiders that: The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.Its not known exactly what secrets the shadowy base has that authorities are desperate to defend.Ufologists — who study unidentied flying objects — believe the site holds alien spacecraft being studied for their technology, a claim famously repeated by a former engineer at the site, Bob Lazar.But conspiracy theorists in the UK dont need to look as far afield as the States for mysterious government facilities linked with UFOs.Nick Pope ran the Ministry of Defences UFO project in the s, looking into reports of flying saucers, crop circles, and even abductions. Here he reveals the secret spots that might be Britains Area . RAF Rudloe Manor, WiltshireTheory: Alien technology being kept in secret underground labFor years, conspiracy theorists believed the government was hiding something at RAF Rudloe Manor in Corsham, Wiltshire.And to some extent, they were right — documents made public in  admitted that the base WAS used in UFO investigations.Thats because Rudloe Manor was home to the Flying Complaints Flight, a unit of the RAF Police which gathered reports of UFO sightings from RAF bases and passed them to the MoD HQ.And the secret site came under even more scrutiny when it was revealed there was a vast network of underground tunnels beneath the base.Ufologists had suspected this for years but instead of the tunnels being used to hide alien technology they were nuclear bomb shelters.The vast subterranean bunkers would be where government ministers and royals wouldve been evacuated tothere was a nuclear strike on Britain.Even though Rudloe Manor was closed in , it still attracts conspiracy theorists — some have been arrested by MoD Police for breaking in.Nick himself had a brush with the authorities when he was filming a documentary there with presenter Giorgio Tsoukalos a few years ago.He said: As a former MoD employee I didn’t feel it was appropriate for me to approach the site, so Giorgio went alone.Within moments, military police turned up and halted filming, further fuelling the conspiracy theories.Ministry of Defence Main Building, LondonTheory: UFO investigations team officially shutdown but still running in secretInside Room  in the MoD Main Building in Whitehall, the governments main UFO project looked into the strange reports of flying saucers around the UK.In the  years the project ran until , around , cases were looked into by the team.Although most were debunked, around five per cent of the cases couldnt be explained.And although the project was officially closed down a decade ago, Nick believes it still operating but now in secret.He claims a source in the MoD told him Americans were now running the project.And another told him investigations have just moved to a new part of the building where the investigators are jokingly referred to as Mulder and Scully.Nick even says protesters have already turned up at the site to demand answers in October .He said: It wasn’t quite on the scale of what’s threatened for Area .Around  people assembled outside Parliament and then marched over to Main Building, waving signs that said ‘UFOs are real’, before handing in a letter demanding an end to UFO secrecy.I’d left the UFO project by then, but they somehow got hold of my new phone number and I had to meet them and formally take possession of their letter.The National Archives, KewTheory: Sensitive documents about aliens kept secret after sham public releaseThe UK’s National Archives in Kew are the final repository of the MoD’s real-le X-Files.Last year, declassied files there showed the government had spent  years looking into UFOs in the hope we could steal alien technology to develop super weapons during the Cold War.The once-secret files showed UFOs were real and being taken seriously.They also detailed near misses between RAF aircraft and UFOs which posed a dangerous threat to the crews safety.The first load of these files was made public in the National Archives in  — and Nick was enlisted to help with their publicity.And over the next  years, more and more information came out, but some files were still redacted.This made some people think the government was holding information back.But Nick says: The blacked-out material is often just names and addresses of UFO witnesses, withheld to protect people’s privacy.If people could see the uncensored files, all people will find out is that Mr Smith of  Acacia Avenue saw a UFO while out walking his dog sometime back in !RAE Farnborough, HampshireTheory: Site of alien abductions is primary location where alien tech would be keptThe Royal Aerospace Establishment at Farnborough, Hampshire has previously been called Britain’s Area .RAE Farnborough was originally set up as an aircraft and weapons research facility at the turn of the twentieth century and closed in the late s.In , a y report by conspiracy theorists claimed the site was well-connected to UFO sightings — and even alien abductions.Rumours persist, and Farnborough is currently home to QinetiQ, a defence technology company that researches and develops cutting-edge equipment including weapons, robotics and space-related tech.And Nick saysthe UK ever did get hold of extraterrestrial tech, it probably wouldve been sent to Farnborough for study.But he also wants to pour cold water on the claims that the site ever did have alien tech — as he had a close relationship with someone who knew for a fact there were no UFO weapons there.Nick said: I’m sceptical about this, for a very good reason — one that’s generated a few conspiracy theories.My late father, Dr. Geoffrey Pope, was the Director of RAE Farnborough, before ending his MoD career as the Deputy Chief Scientic Adviser.As he once joked: If there was spaceship in a hangar somewhere in the UK, it would have been my hangar!BAE Warton, LancashireTheory: Next-generation aircraft developed from UFOsBAE Systems is one of the worlds biggest defence companies and Warton is its manufacturing and testing facility.Its the birthplace of some of the most innovative fighter jets ever made, including the Typhoon and the Tornado.But multiple conspiracy theorists say theyve seen UFOs flying over the airfield, sparking rumours of alien technology at the site.In fact, the MoD even had to officially deny that it had been testing its new unmanned aircraft, Taranis, after a UFO was blamed for the destruction of a wind turbine.And Nick says you only have to look at the development of cutting-edge aircraft to be confident BAE Warton has technology the public dont know about.He said: People would be staggeredthey knew how long ago stealth technology was being developed, many years before anything was officially acknowledged.The RAF’s proposed Tempest aircraft – BAE Systems is one of the partners – will be armed with lasers and hypersonic weapons, and accompanied by a drone swarm.If this is the stuff they’re telling you about, what aren’t they telling you Considering the possibility of alien technology being hidden somewhere in the UK, Nick remains sceptical well ever really know about it.He said: If Britain does have an Area , andalien secrets are being kept somewhere in the UK, my view is that while the locations I’ve mentioned are signicant, the real action will going on somewhere , at a location so secret, the media and public have never heard of it.The truth is out there…

He also adds that: “I prefer a quiet le away from the day job.” And the band played Believe It If You Like.To recap: Paul is a master baker who caught a lucky break after being booked to appear on what became TV juggernaut The Great British Bake Off.Back then he was happily married to we Alex and, outside of an occasional media interview to plug the show, his home le never made the headlines.A bit of work and no play made Paul a dull boy when it came to clickbait. Then he had a fling with fellow TV chef Marcela Valladolid and all hell broke loose.Sex sells. It always has. So does scandal, and cheating on your we with a younger woman fits firmly into both categories.When the fling ended, the admirably forgiving Alex took Paul back, but the marriage faltered again and he took up with a -year-old barmaid with a fondness for miniskirts and crop tops.What’s not to love for the hundreds of “paparazzo”who make a living from how many times their photo gets viewed online It’s not rocket science, is it  Earlier this year I spotted Judi Dench out supermarket shopping.Yes, that Judi Dench. Dame of the British Empire. Oscar winner. Recipient of more awards than Mr Hollywood’s had hot buns.And favoured guest of chatshow host Graham Norton. But there she was, browsing the aisles and totally unbothered by anyone.Why  Well, firstly, she wasn’t wilfully drawing attention to herself by radiating self-importance. And secondly, while she’s paid to be dramatic on screen, her le outside of it is anything but.Meaning that, in everyday le, her showbiz currency — the aforementioned “clickbait” — is, depending on how you view such things, blissfully low.But , say, she decided to dump her conservationist partner David Mills for a young barman from her local pub, a photo of her low-key shopping trip would be front-page news. Simple really.Aside from the marvellous Ms Dench, there are oodles of A- listers who live non-famous lives, popping to the supermarket or going for a low-key dinner — for example, not The Ivy et al — with loved ones.Occasionally, they might be spotted and photographed, but they just keep their head down and ignore it, accepting that it’s a small price to pay for the myriad other benefits fame brings.NDAsare now commonly used by celebrities to ensure the silence of, say, a nanny who will be privy to what happens behind closed doors — and that’s perhaps understandable.But asking a lover to sign on the dotted line when you’ve already been together two years is saying, in so many words: “I don’t trust you, but I want to carry on sleeping with you.”Who can blame Summer for telling him to stick it where the sun don’t shine Famous US basketball coach and mentor, John Wooden , once said: “Talent is God given Be humble. Fame is man-given Be grateful. Conceit is self-given Be careful.”Wise words that Mr Hollywoodwould do well to heed.WHATEVER you think of Boris Johnson’s politics, it can’t be denied that he’s working his King Ashurbanipal socks offas our new PM.Hospitals, factories, flood-hit towns – you name it, he’s popping up there to put a smile on everyone’s face and reassure them that everything is under control.He’s the frontman while the rest of the bandare putting in the hours at the studio, hopefully producing the hits. Time will tell.But suffice to say, he’s already shaping up to be the UK’s cheerleader – a feat the more reserved and aloof Theresa May never quite managed.WHEN asked about children, Prince Harry replied that he and we Meghan might have “two, maximum”.Fair enough, I thought. After all, she’s  now and,she’s lucky, Mother Nature might let her conceive one more before her womb shuts shop.But no, it seems the royal couple’s decision is to do with population growth, despite experts saying that, globally, the birthrate is shrinking and the real issue is how long we’re all living.So unless he’s planning to pack Granny off to Dignitas, there’s not much he can do about it. But I digress.Regarding royal babies and, in particular, Harry and Meghan’s sensitivity around their firstborn’s privacy, perhaps they should copy his cousin Zara.She and husband Mike Tindall have two daughters, Mia, five, and Lena, one. There’s no showboating or churlishness, they just give their daughters as normal a le as possible via picnics, getting muddy, painting faces and rough and tumble – as seen in thisdelightful photo of mischievous Mia hitching a ride on Dad’s back.They occasionally get photographed, but clearly accept that it’s just one of those things and don’t let it bother them. A parenting template to be admired, whoever you are.THE author Alex Elle once said: “I am very cautious of people whose actions don’t match their words.”In which case, let’s hope she wasn’t invited to the recent Google Camp party in Sicily which,you’re one of the self-regarding A-listers in attendance, was a high-minded gathering to discuss the issue of climate change.Or to the rest of us – a boondoggle for entitled fools. How  to describe an event attended by  of some of the world’s richest people who arrived on eco-unfriendly private jets and luxury yachts Oh, the unacknowledged irony. Meanwhile, Leona Lewis and ious other celebrities, who advocate gun control, happily took a shilling or three to attend the Austria-based party of Gaston Glock – one of the world’s most famous gun makers.But back to Google Camp where – and I can’t quite believe I’m writing this – residents and hotel guests near the archaeological site of Selinunte were told by police to avoid looking out of their windows to protect the privacy of the invited A-listers dining al fresco.The same slebs, one assumes, who regularly virtue signal their moral credentials by advocating a world without borders, where everyone should be treated the same . . . yada yada.

But after spilling a bit of the glue on her £ “Pink Soda” leggings from JD Sports, they started emitting noxious smoke.Her sister Poppy, eight, and three-year-old brother Hugo complained their eyes were stinging as the poisonous cloud filled the car.Louise pulled over immediately and removed Lilly’s leggings, swabbing the burned areas with wet tissues before driving to nearby St Peter’s Hospital, Chertsey.They assessed the injuries and referred Lilly to a specialist burns unit in East Grinstead, West Sussex.Doctors conducted tests which showed the burns were quite deep, and may require skin grafts.Louise and husband Peter, , complained to Primark and they asked them to send in the glue for testing.A Primark spokesman said: “We take the safety of our customers and the quality of our products very seriously. This nail glue complies fully with EU standards for safety, quality and product labelling.The glue is made of two ingredients which are both commonly used in similar products sold by retailers across the high street.

But things aren’t quite working out that way.While the UK economy is far from booming, it is holding up much better than those in the Eurozone. Figures released yesterday show Germany’s manufacturing sector contracted by . per cent in July and is now a shocking . per cent smaller than it was a year ago.Given the importance of manufacturing to the German economy, it is likely the whole economy is now heading for recession — a fate the country only narrowly avoided at the end of last year.In Italy, too, economic growth has ground to a halt again — after the country only just hauled itself out of last year’s recession. In France, growth in the past three months fell to . per cent.By contrast, our economy looks relatively perky, with growth of . per cent in the three months to May. Figures released on Monday showed a rebound in confidence in the dominant services sector.Of the large Eurozone countries, only Spain is currently outgrowing us — but Spain is still recovering after a very deep recession from which it emerged in . In common with Italy, the Spanish economy is still smaller than it was before the - banking crisis.Not that you will hear any of this from Remainers. Every time a car factory is earmarked for closure or a steelworks runs into problems, we hear no end of people saying, “We told you so”.All bad news in the UK economy is automatically attributed to Brexit — on the BBC, especially. What we don’t hear is that manufacturing industries, especially cars and steel, are suffering the same problems across Europe.Germany’s car industry is still reeling from the scandal of Volkswagen cheating in emissions tests by installing software to detect when a car was in test mode.On top of that comes the proposed switch from petrol and diesel to electric cars. Many motorists — myself included — have put off buying new vehicles because we don’t know what to get.We have been told new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from  and worry they might be taxed out of existence well before then. Yet electric cars are still prohibitively expensive and can’t travel nearly far enough between charges.As for the steel industry, all across Europe it is struggling to compete with cheap competition from China — especially since the trade war with the US forced Chinese exporters to search for new markets away from America.Of course,we end up with a No-Deal Brexit and tarfs are imposed on imports and exports between Britain and the EU, it will cause some disruption to trade. But it is wrong to assume Britain will come off worse. In truth, EU exporters have more to lose. Britain runs a huge trade deficit with the EU.In  we exported £billion worth of goods and services to other EU countries and imported £billion from them — a trade gap of £billion. Moreover, EU exports to Britain are concentrated in products that attract relatively high tarfs.Cars, for example, attract an EU import tarf of ten per cent. If Britain chooses to impose that levy in reverse after Brexit, it will cause further mayhem in the German car industry.We also have a high deficit in food — which under EU rules attracts average tarfs of  per cent. For dairy products, the average EU import tarf is  per cent. If our Government decides to impose this on imports from the EU, it will mean the end of quite a few French cheese producers.Of course, the EU can avoid damaging these export industries by agreeing to a trade deal with the UK — one that doesn’t include the hated Irish backstop.Nearly half of Irish food exports go to the UK. Irish exports to other EU countries would be deeply affected as so many rely on UK roads. If there are delays at ports, traffic between Ireland and the Continent will suffer twice over — once crossing the Irish Sea then crossing the English Channel.EU leaders want to punish Britain for voting to leave their sacred project. They fear thatBritain is seen to do well, other countries will want to leave. But playing hardball with Britain will do deep harm to their own export industries.Does German chancellor Angela Merkel want to suffer the wrath of her country’s car makers  Does French president Emmanuel Macron wish to anger winemakers already struggling with an economic downturn at home A hard Brexit could cost Denmark as much as one per cent in lost gross domestic product. Their former economy minister Simon Emil Ammitzboll calls Brexit “the most visible threat to the Danish economy”.Holland and Belgium calculate similar falls will hit their economies, with the Dutch losing ten billion euros by . In Spain, wages for unskilled youths are lower than they were in the late s. Youth unemployment is a huge problem. Even qualied youths face a lower annual salary than their counterparts a decade ago.The alternative to all this is for the EU to swallow a bit of pride and agree to keep free trade flowing, perhaps via a temporary deal while long-term arrangements are negotiated.It won’t take much. Just remove the backstop — really just an underhand way of trying to keep Britain in the straitjacket of EU regulations and trade barriers — and some kind of withdrawal agreement would almost certainly make it through the Commons.If not, then yes, British industry will suffer in some ways from No Deal. But the Eurozone economies already lagging behind will take the bigger hit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

With Theresa May, it never was. Brussels knew she didn’t even want to leave, never mind with No Deal.Not any more. Second, he’s shaking up the civil service a bit.  It was civil servants who did most of the negotiating — and they are all wildly pro Remain.But with Boris’s adviser Dominic Cummings wielding the stick they might just be a little more amenable than before.Third — he’s realised that the bloody Northern Ireland backstop was never anywhere near so serious an impediment as the Remainersclaimed.And fourth, and maybe most importantly, he’s leading the country with a sense of optimism and chutzpah.Of course it’s Boris, so he may well do something totally bonkers and wreck the process. But so far he’s got everything right.He hasn’t got long to sort out a deal, the days are counting down. But my guess is that he WILL get one.The EU likes to talk a hard game but it usually budges in the end. It is desperate to avoid No Deal.Andit doesn’t budge — fine. A bumpy road for a few weeks and we’ll be OK, better off than ever. And free. The big threat to Brexit is not the EU — it’s our Parliament, once again.The Labour Party has ditched all semblance of principle and is now for a second referendum.Worse, Boris has a majority of only one. That’s not his fault — blame Theresa May for calling an election two years ago.It looks to me thatMagic Grandpa Jeremy Corbyn calls a vote of no confidence, he will probably win.Labour is already cosying up to the Scottish Nationalists and saying they wouldn’t mind a second referendum on independence.There is now nothing Labour wouldn’t do to gain power. Destroy the union and scupper Brexit — Magic Grandpa doesn’t care.Butthis whole thing ends with Labour des- troying Brexit, the party will never be trusted again.Oh sure, it will still get the votes from the metropolitan, middle-class lefties. But its working-class base will desert it, for good.So the message for Magic Grandpa is very clear. Win your vote of confidence, lose your voters. He’s not the brightest of men, but I do hope he grasps this.And Boris  Keep straight ahead. Play as hardball as possible with Brussels, knowing they want a deal. Strike as many deals with the likes of the USA and Canada as possible.And remind Brussels thatwe walk away without a deal, they don’t get a single penny from us. That should help to concentrate their minds for a while.This has been revealed in a new report by researchers with too much time on their hands. What these men want, I think, is the best of both worlds.I used to have a girlfriend who spent all day long sitting on the roof of the shed. Then she’d dart out into the road after a thrush. She was great.Had a little bell around her neck. And did her business in a small tray by the back door.A WOMAN in East London said nasty things to someone taking part in a gay Pride march. She was wearing a niqab, so the lefties didn’t get too cross.Still, it is at last beginning to dawn on the woke liberals that the more fervently Muslim a person may be, the less likely it is that he or she will take kindly to people who have a knack for interior design and enjoy watching Mamma Mia!.This has put them in a bit of a quandary. Much as have those largely Muslim protests outside schools in the Midlands which insist on teaching kids how wonderful gay relationships might be.The same sort of quandary that affects feminists, who are not entirely convinced that a ft chap with a todger and a beard who wishes to be called “Loretta” in the name of gender freedom actually is a woman.This is the thing with identity politics, protected characteristics and so on.

It was a little sink thing that you stand in and wash yourself.”After complaining to the staff, Portia claims she was initially told to clean the apartment herself but when she refused, another season worker was paid £ to do it.One evening after a night out, she reportedly woke to find an unknown man sat on the edge of her bed.When she asked who he was, he said shag me, before she chased him out in fear.Portia said: The first night my door was open because there was no air-con. This man walked into my room, sat on to my bed and said shag me. This was a stranger.I was screaming at him to get out and I didnt see him after that.

They looked so childish.Ive never seen anything like it to be honest. Im gobsmacked.”Workers Family claimed that Portia paid only £ for her accommodation, not £. Tony Furnival, a director at Workers Family, said: The broken wardrobe, thats pretty bad. That should have been fixed.As regards bunk-beds, its hostel-style accommodation. You might as well take a picture of any hostel across the world.If it is dirty, thats the people that are living there. Its hostel-style accommodation that theyre responsible for.There is cleaning to a degree [by cleaners].

publicity, Paul Hollywood — just ask Oscar-winning Judi Dench As a former Labour activist who spent a decade working alongside Corbyn in his Islington North constituency, I agree with everything Johnson says.Having observed him at close quarters during the years when he was a backbench rebel, I now find the idea of Corbyn as Prime Minister both laughable and terrying.Profoundly unfit for the highest office, he is a toxic ideological extremist without a clue about how to govern Britain.Having poisoned his own party, he would wreck our country toohe came near to power.But what makes me despair is the timidity of sensible Labour folk, who regard Corbyn with contempt yet are still willing to march under his banner.They proclaim that they think he is a disaster, but they allow him to remain in place.This pathetic ineffectuality was captured by Yvette Cooper, widely regarded as possible alternative leader, who bleated to the BBC at the weekend that there is a real concern we don’t look like enough of a broad church at the moment.What a gross understatement.In fact, the Labour Party is in the grip of hardline, quasi-Marxist, anti-Semitic personality cult.But apart from wringing their hands, the likes of Ms Cooper do nothing about it.If Labour is to have a future, the moderates have to get off their knees and start to challenge Corbyn properly.They should be inspired by the words of the great former leader Hugh Gaitskell, a passionate centrist, who famously told the  conference — where the left had prevailed — that he would fight, fight and fight again to bring back sanity and honesty and dignity to the party I love.The moderates need that kind of resolution today, but they show precious little sign of it.They are not only cowardly, but also hypocritical.They send their angry tweets and whine to the broadcasters, but, by campaigning for Labour, they are still working for Corbyn to be Prime Minister.If, as appears likely, a General Election is called soon, the so-called moderates will all be out canvassing in their constituencies for theof a Corbyn-led Government.That reality makes all their denunciations of him completely meaningless.Effectively, the moderates are Corbyn enablers and agents of his extremism.Rather than serve as doormats, they should take a lesson from the Tories, who have long been ruthless about dumping their leaders.Neville Chamberlain, Anthony Eden, Ted Heath, Iain Duncan-Smith, and even Margaret Thatcher were all clinically dispatched once they were deemed to be ineffective or unpopular.The same ruthlessness with personnel could be seen in the way Boris Johnson reconstructed his Cabinet last month as he sacked  ministers in his night of the blond knives, including even the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.In contrast, Labour has always been pathetically soft about butchery.In the whole of the party’s -year history, only one leader has ever been forced out against his will and that, ironically, was Tony Blair, by far Labour’s greatest election winner.All the rest chose when to go, even the poor ones like Neil Kinnock, Michael Foot and the s pacist George Lansbury.Today, there are plenty of steps that the moderates could take to crank up the pressure on Corbyn.They could push for another vote of no confidence in him. They could resign the Labour whip in the Commons. They could boycott his appearances at Prime Ministers Questions and other statements.But, as Labour slides towards catastrophe, they have done none of this.What explains their inaction  Part of the answer is fear of the Corbyn machine, especially his supporters’ powerful pressure group Momentum, which is notorious for its intolerance.In fact, though there has been a recent decline in Labour membership, Corbyn backers still make the majority of activists.Any Labour MP who speaks out against Corbyn therefore risks deselection. For the sake of their Parliamentary careers, most of them keep quiet.But there are also deeper factors at work.One is mainstream Labour’s horror at any supposed betrayal of the socialist cause.This is partly because Labour is such a tribal movement, as shown in the ferocious anger generated in  by Ramsay MacDonald’s decision to break with the party by forming a National Government with the despised Tories.Since then treachery is regarded as the greatest sin, far worse than incompetence or unpopularity.This trait particularly insulates Corbyn, who, for all his spectacular failings, is still regarded by the majority of the membership as an authentic socialist.There is also a deep streak of sentimentality in Labour, which stems from the party’s origins in the trade union movement.In this mindset of supposed compassion, sacking people is what the bosses do, not the workers.When the nondescript Clement Attlee was surprisingly elected Labour leader in , supporters of his rival Herbert Morrison tried to comfort him by saying Attlee’s spell at the top would be short-lived.Morrison was having none of it.The party, he said, was sentimental and having once made a man leader, would stick to him.He was right. Attlee was still in post  years later.Sentimentality explains why so many anti-leadership plots are botched.I saw this for myself working as a Labour researcher at Westminster in the late s and early s, when there were hidden manoeuvres against Kinnock.But they all came to nothing because the plotters lacked the determination to finish the job.The same was true during Gordon Brown’s woeful premiership, when conspirators abandoned the battle when the moment came to strike.More interested in dogma than office, the Labour party lacks the unsparing instinct for power that infuses the Tories, which helps to explain why the Conservatives have been in Government for twice as long. Since  , the Tories have been in office for  years and Labour for just .The absence of hard ambition means that socialists are willing to put up with a dud like Corbyn, while they mouth their slogans and wave the red flag.The wilderness is their ideological comfort zone – and Corbyn will ensure they remain there."},{"url":null,"title":"brussels chiefs want showdown with boris but order him to keep the backstop first if he wants better deal before october 31","story":"The European Commission said the Withdrawal Agreement was “not up for negotiation” in a statement today.Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told a news briefing in Brussels: “So far it...remains unchanged - this position that the Withdrawal Agreement is not up for negotiation but we are open to talk about the political declaration.“And of course we are willing to talk and engage with Prime Minister Johnson.”The PM has so far refused to hold talks with EU chiefs and will not compromise on his stance against Theresa May’s hated deal.He has previously warned thatthe EU dont budge on getting rid of the backstop, it will be their choice to push Britain out of the bloc without an agreement by October .The backstop, which would come into playa future trading arrangement falls short of keeping the border open, has been the main stumbling block on Brexit negotiations.However, Andreeva said it was not the Commission’s “business” to play a “blame game”.She added: “Our business is to prepare for a no deal.“Both sides negotiated with the very best intentions and the very best efforts.

I am certainly not fatalistic about that.”But DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson urged Boris to channel the spirit of Margaret Thatcher in responding to Mr Varadkar’s suggestions.“Revoking Article  means overturning the referendum result, accepting the current Withdrawal Agreement means you split up the UK, and the extension simply kicks the issue down the road until a new government comes in, which is what the EU would love to happen.“None of them are realistic in any way, and the PM ought to do the same as Margaret Thatcher did and say ‘no, no, no’ to all of them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic raab travels 21309 miles in just three days in mammoth brexit trade deal blitz","story":"The Foreign Secretary was sent across the world by Boris Johnson to broker new trade deals with the US, Canada and Mexico on a three-day whistle-stop tour.On Tuesday, Raab flew into Toronto to meet foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland, before jetting off for a crucial summit with President Donald Trump in Washington and finally arriving in Mexico City later today.Boris has ramped up efforts to strike new ambitious relationships with global partners as the UK prepares for its orce from EU on October .The PM has long spoken of the opportunities away from the bloc with nations like the US and Australia lined up for bonanza trade deals.On the first day of Raabs trans-Atlantic charm offensive, he told reporters that he wanted to take Canada and the UKs relationship to the “next level”.He said: “Were going to remain and we hope to be good European neighbours, partners and friends in the future but we do want to grasp those global opportunities and we want to expand our horizons and raise our level of ambitions in the world.”After Toronto, Raab zoomed over to the White House to meet with President Trump and key officials including, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Wednesdays meeting was a huge success for No with the President again reaffirming his “huge appetite” for a trade deal with Britain after Brexit.Pompeo offered another boost for Boris, when he said: “We support the United Kingdom’s sovereign choice, however Brexit ultimately shakes out.“And we’ll be on the doorstep, pen in hand, ready to sign a new free trade agreement at the earliest possible time.”Raab’s fast and furious tour ends today with a visit to Mexico City where he believes economic links between our two nations will be a “win-win”.He said: “The UK is excited to be working with our Mexican friends to develop a win-win relationship.“There are huge opportunities to boost two-way trade, create jobs, tackle poverty and inequality, and address key Mexican priorities such as strengthening transparency and reducing corruption.”Boris is desperate for Britain to make new trade links as the government prepares for a No Deal scenario with Brussels chiefs.The PM has warned Tory rebels are EU negotiators that we will be leaving the bloke “do or die” by Halloween.Raabs first two weeks as Foreign Secretary have been jam-packed -

Portia Nancarrow, , says she forked out £, for the last-minute trip with working holiday organisers Workers Family, which promised her memories that will last a letime. But she says she was put in a filthy apartment above a takeaway which had a smashed bed and rubbish strewn over the floor. She even alleges she awoke on the first night last week to discover a stranger sitting on the end of her bed thanks to having no lock on her door. She says she chased the man out when he suggested she s*** him. Have you been on a horror holiday  Contact webnews@trinitymirror    Portia, from Ebbw Vale, south Wales, said: It was actually disgusting. I thought I was big and tough before I went out there but now I realise Iaposm not. When I first got there they put me in this accommodation [above a takeaway]. But Workers Family says it offers safe and clean accommodation for young people wanting to escape the UK and have an amazing summer. Portia flew back to the UK two nights after arriving and has since complained to the firm. She wants to warn other young people to be careful when planning to work in holiday destinations.    The teenager continued: There were four beds that were already taken up. I had to ring one of the reps and he moved me upstairs. This new room they put me in was stinking. It was unreal. When you went in, all the doors had holes in them from where people had been fighting. There was a smashed up bed all over the floor, rubbish everywhere, the floor was stinking. I took my shoes off for two seconds and my feet were black. Nothing had been cleaned. All the bed was broken and that had to be chucked outside. They left that on the balcony. But Workers Family denied Portia did not have access to pillows. Tony Furnival, one of its directors, did concede it was the lowest standard of accommodation that was not fit for tourists - but said the workers should expect that.  And while Portia says she paid £ for the accommodation, Workers Family claims it charged £. In my room there were three of us but just two beds. In the room above me there were five boys and three beds, Portia continued. The mattresses were all dirty - it looked like mud. We didnapost have pillows either. It was only by chance that I took my own love heart pillow on the plane. I said to the rep that none of us had pillows and he said aposthereaposs nothing we can do about that - thereaposs another  people waiting for themapos. Weaposd spent all this money and they didnapost give me a pillow. After complaining to the staff, Portia claims she was initially told to clean the apartment herself but when she refused, another season worker was paid £ to do it. Portia added: The first night my door was open because there was no air-con. This man walked into my room, sat on to my bed and said aposs*** meapos. This was a stranger. I was screaming at him to get out and I didnapost see him after that. For all they know something could have happened to me. They get your money, send you over there then thataposs it. She alleges one of the bosses there told her to get [off her] lazy fat a** and cleaned the f***ing apartment.  Iaposve never seen anything like it to be honest. Iaposm gobsmacked, Portia said. I went out on my own and I think thataposs why they took advantage. The whole experience was awful. Theyaposve massively done me over. Theyaposve taken all of that money that I could have spent on something . My nan and dad paid for it - thataposs whataposs even worse. They were really worried. In a y statement, Mr Furnival said: The broken wardrobe, thataposs pretty bad. That should have been fixed. As regards bunk-beds, itaposs hostel-style accommodation. You might as well take a picture of any hostel across the world. If it is dirty, thataposs the people that are living there. Itaposs hostel-style accommodation that theyaposre responsible for.   There is cleaning to a degree [by cleaners]. Because itaposs the end of the season there are so many places she could have been moved. I donapost want you thinking for one second that Iaposm saying nothing sheaposs said is true, but these young people get the lowest standard of accommodation. Itaposs not good enough for year round people, itaposs not good enough for tourists. These claims that people are going out there is so far from what I know to be true, that Iaposm a bit offended. I wasnapost there on that day so these things about a lad going in the room, I canapost lie and say I was there. But itaposs shared accommodation. Weaposve been doing this a lot of years and while thereaposs ious complaints come about, the way sheaposs described itthis was as such aas she said, do you not think it would be a national scandal  There were faults on our part, but the way itaposs been painted, itaposs really over the top.

Zoe Sargent, then , began bleeding heavily and was rushed to hospital after suffering fatigue for weeks.

I had some light bleeding for a couple of months and some pains, but I didn’t think anything of it and thought they were normal pains women sometimes get, Zoe, now , told Hull Live .I was working in a pub over Christmas and I put it down to being tired and losing weight to the stress of the job.    I booked into see my GP after slight bleeding, and they had booked me in for a scan to seeit was cysts or polyps, but before that could happen I was rushed to hospital. I could never have believed they would have told me I had stage three cancer. But Zoe didnapost have smear tests prior to this because of her lestyle as a dancer. The woman, who lives with her fiancé, Jimmy Hargreaves, said: I was travelling around holiday parks and I wasn’t registered to a GP, and to be honest I never thought it was something I needed to do.    Looking back it’s something I should have done. It’s not something I was scared of, but I just felt it was something I didnapost need to do yet. It sounds stupid saying it now, but I was only  and I was never in one place to go and have the test. Doctors also told Zoe her kidneys had failed. Now she must undergo an operation every six months to make sure the stents are working to avoid a catheter or colostomy bag having to be fitted. However, she was told recently she had reacted brilliantly to the treatment and her tumour was no longer visible on any scans. I have to go and see my consultant in September to make sure the cancer has gone, but all of the radiotherapy and treatments have ended now,” she said. Approximately , cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK. Regular cervical screeningare important to detect pre-cancerous cell changes in the cervix, whichdetected early and removed can prevent cervical cancer from developing. All women aged  and above registered with a GP in the UK are invited for cervical screening - a test which analysis the health of cells in the cervix. If abnormal cells are detected they can be treated and removed before they have time to develop into cancer.Women aged  to  are invited for a cervical smear through the NHS every three years, women aged  -  are invited for a test every five years. Those aged  and above are only invited for testingthey have not been screened since they were  orthey recently had abnormal tests. Although early-stage cervical cancer can be symptomless, common symptoms of the illness include: · Vaginal bleeding between periods · Vaginal bleeding after sex · Vaginal bleeding after the menopause . Other symptoms include: · A smelly vaginal discharge · Discomfort during sex · Pain in the pelvic area Women are advised to attend regular screening and to noty your GPyou develop any of these symptoms between smear tests.

Welfare officers discovered ten animals living in a stable block surrounded by their own filth, in a neglect case the inspector said was the worst sheaposd ever seen. Two of the horses even had to be dug out, because the filth had blocked the stable door. The horses had not had a farrier to trim their hooves for at least  months, when this should happen every six weeks. This had caused the hooves to grow out of control leaving the horses crippled and struggling to walk. Five horses were in such a state of suffering that an independent vet decided the kindest thing was to put them to sleep immediately. A further three were sent for emergency surgery before it was decided that they too needed to be put to sleep to end their suffering.    A court has now banned a man from keeping all animals after his neglect of the horses was discovered. Carl Kawka, , of Greenbank Road, Rochdale, pleaded guilty to two animal welfare offences when he appeared at Tameside Magistrates’ Court last Thursday. The court heard how the RSPCA was sent to investigate Kawka over concerns about  horses he had in his care in stables in Oldham. Inspector Danni Jennings and officers from World Horse Welfare found eight horses had severely overgrown and deformed hooves which had left them crippled. In mitigation, the court heard Kawka was struggling due to health issues. Fortunately, following y treatment, two of the horses are on the road to recovery. One, called Ronnie, has now been rehomed, and another called Celine is recovering well and will be due for re-homing soon. Kawka was banned from keeping all animals, given an -week custodial sentence suspended for  months and a five month curfew between pm and am.

Kateaposs love for the great outdoors is well-known, with the Duchess launching her own garden at the Cha Flower Show earlier this year to encourage others to get outside. However, the royal relies on one particularly gruelling exercise to maintain her defined abdomen, according to the.    The mum-of-three swears by an move called the plank, which is similar to a push-up except a personaposs forearms rest on the ground instead of their hands. Plank practitioners have to maintain this position for a period of time, with the stance becoming more painful the longer it is held. A source told Mail Online: There are three elements, the basic plank, the side plank and the prone sky e, all of which are positions Kate can hold for  seconds or longer and repeat at least ten times each. The side plank requires you to balance on your side, holding your body straight with feet together and one arm flexed directly under your shoulder. Meanwhile, the prone sky e plank is slightly less excruciating, as you have to lie on your tummy and gently raise your chest off the floor until your tummy muscles beg for mercy.

The Duke posted an adorable message on the coupleaposs Instagram page reportedly hosted some low-key celebrations at their Windsor home Frogmore Cottage .And according to an insider, Harry sorted out a very sweet present for little Archie to give his mum to mark the occasion - an engraved photo frame with snap of the royal tot in it. Meghan loves black and white snaps and nearly always picks one to be the official photo from important events, including their engagement, wedding and Archieaposs christening.An insider told the Sun : This year there will be a birthday gt from Archie and the odds are on a sepia or black and white photograph of her precious son in a solid silver frame from Aspreys.   The precious present is likely to have an engraving chosen by Harry that will make it extra special. Asprey sells a stunning collection of frames costing anything between £ and £. And of course Harry will also have treated his we to something special on her th birthday. During their relationship the Prince has designed a number of pieces of jewellery for his we, including her engagement and eternity rings.  The insider believes this birthday would have been no dferent, and they think there would have been a very special box waiting for Meghan on Sunday morning. They said: And Harry has a weakness for designing jewellery for Meghan, so it is expected that the royal will design another stunning piece - likely to be earrings - as a Sussex surprise.Even though it sounds like she got some very lovely gts from her loved ones, there is one thing she always asks for her birthday . On her rd birthday, Meghan posted a very personal message to her loyal fans and followers on her blog The Tig. She wrote: I am  years old today. And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well…it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it. My s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool as hip as smart as “whatever” as everyone . My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant. My high school had cliques: the black girls and white girls, the Filipino and the Latina girls.    Being biracial, I fell somewhere in between. So everyday during lunch, I busied myself with meetings – French club, student body, whatever one could possibly do between noon and pm- I was there. Not so that I was more involved, but so that I wouldn’t have to eat alone. I must have been about  when a casting director looked at me during an audition and said “You need to know that you’re enough. Less makeup, more Meghan.” You need to know that you’re enough. A mantra that has now engrained itself so deeply within me that not a day goes by without hearing it chime in my head.  That five pounds lost won’t make you happier, that more makeup won’t make you prettier, that the now iconic saying from Jerry Maguire -” You complete me” – frankly, isn’t true. You are complete with or without a partner. You are enough just as you are. She goes on to ask a favour of her fans, telling them what she wants them to do for her birthday.

George Handley has Asperger Syndrome and finds social situations awkward, which is one of the reasons he has never had a girlfriend. But he is willing to put his shyness behind him and has planned the ideal romantic getaway – but first he needs to find a woman to join him. Theatre fan George, from Nottingham, has even bought a spare ticket to Fame the Musical in Bournemouth, where he will mark his st birthday on August .    He has now launched a search for his ideal woman in the hope of finding a date for his big day. He said: “I would like someone for a long-term, permanent relationship, who I’ll be able to get on with and is a bit younger than me. “I’m in my early s and it’s hard to find someone my age who would be able to have children. “My father was  years older than my mother so the age gap shouldnapost be a problem. “I’d like them to be understanding, nice and quite attractive.

Every year I always go to the theatre to watch a musical and this year Iaposve bought an extra ticket because Iaposd really love for someone to sit next to me and share in the experience. George struggles with social interaction and has had bad experiences in the past. He said: “Due to my Aspergers I have a social phobia of meeting people. “It’s hard going to places like pubs and I’m not really a drinker. I have a glass of sherry at Christmas. “I had problems in my last year of school that put me off socialising with people of my own age.  I was bullied and one day someone attacked me coming back from school. It put me off friends and relationships. “Itaposs hard to talk about and still painful  years on. Despite his past social struggles, George says he would be a good catch for any woman. “I have a sense of humour, he added. And I can make people laugh. I’d offer a stable relationship and I wouldn’t let my partner down. I would be a lot happier and more confidentI had a girlfriend.  “Sometimes I’d like to go on holiday but it is dficult going places on your own. “I have been depressed.

Brooke Houts has been slammed for allegedly abusing her pet Doberman, Sphinx, in a YouTube video. In footage which has surfaced online, the -year-old appears to smack her dog after he jumped up at her shouting No! before she appears to pin him down to the floor and spit on him. Houtsapos subscribers believed she accidentally uploaded an unedited clip of the alleged abuse on social media.The video, which was re-published on Twitter by popular YouTuber Keemstar on Wednesday, has since gained over  million views. Los Angeles Police Departmentaposs Animal Cruelty Task Force have since said they are investigating the incident. Houts has faced widespread backlash over the video from users and even popular Youtubers. Controversial YouTuber Logan Paul described the video as remarkably grotesque. He added: Discipline your animals should they misbehave. i get it. but despite the hitting, the spitting is a totally unwarranted, inappropriate, and vile display of energy that makes this woman completely unfit to own that dog. Houts has since issued a statement responding to allegations of abuse.  She wrote in a Twitter post: I want to clary that I am not a dog abuser or animal abuser in any way, shape or form. Houts apologised for her actions, saying she was upset and frustrated the day she filmed the video and that her dog required expensive training. She added: Anything I say isn’t going to make those who believe I’m a bad person stop believing that, and I’m aware of this,’ the YouTuber wrote. I apologise to anyone who has been effectednegatively by the footage. First off, I want to address the uncut footage.  On the day in particular that the video was filmed, and actually this past week, things in my outside le have been less than exceptional. I am not going to play the “victim card” or anything of that sort, but I do want to point out that I am rarely as upset as what was shown in the footage.

Itaposs an unbelievably high figure, but itaposs an easy mistake to make. The size of our boobs can change for a number of reasons, includingwe lose or gain any weight, but lots of us of guilty of getting measured and sticking to that size for years. So how do you knowyouaposre wearing the right bra  And how often should you buy a new one  Marks and Spenceraposs bra fit expert and technical manager Julia Mercer has spoken to theto answer these important questions.  How do I knowIaposm wearing the right bra  There are a few tell-tale signs that youaposre not wearing the right size bra. Under-boob This is when it looks like your boob is coming out under the cup. Itaposs caused when the underband is too big and the cup is too small. Julia says: A good fitting underband should fit firmly but not too tight. The best way to check that a bra is fitting correctly is to lt the arms up and twist the body, the bra shouldnapost move and stay in place at all times. Side-boob This is when the boobs spill out of the side. Itaposs caused by the cup being too small. It can be very painful. To check the cup fits correctly, make sure it is fully encasing ALL the breast tissue. Tight straps  You should adjust your straps so you can just fit two fingers on top of each other underneath. A good way to checkyour bra is giving you enough support is to slide the straps off and seethe cups are still supportive. The straps are designed to hold the cups up, not to give support. Julia says: Some larger breasted ladies may suffer with sore red marks on their shoulders where the straps have been over adjusted with the intention of gaining extra support. If straps are shortened too much the breast will fall forward and the back of the bra will work its way up, therefore not giving support at all. The four-boob effect This is when the incorrect cup size pushes the tissue up. It can look very unflattering when youaposre wearing clothes. Julia says: This is a common problem we see regularly. Itaposs very common with women who have put on weight as the breast is made up of % fat. Some women donapost want to go up a cup size and continue to wear the wrong size which can make outwear look unflattering. Did you know thatyou wear the correct cup size you can actually look smaller  Back fat According to Julia: Unfortunately every woman, no matter their size, has this issue and can be made worsethe underband of the bra is too tight.  A good tip is to wear a shaped back bra as this smoothes any lumps and bumps. Cups are too big If youaposve lost weight recently, there is a good chance you cups will be too big. This means they wonapost support the breast tissue properly, and it can also make your bra look unflattering. The cup and the underband should fit snugly. How are bras measured  Bras are fitted by taking two measurements, and it only takes a few minutes.  You can wear your old bra while these measurements are being taken. The band size is the size of your rib cage, and is taken by measuring just below the strap of your existing bra. Itaposs recorded in even numbers, e.g. , , , . The second measurement is the bust. The person doing your fitting will when work out the dference between the rib cage and the bust size and work out your cup size. This will be a letter, e.g. A, B, C, D, DD. How long do bras last  If weaposre being honest, most of us have bras in the drawer which have seen better days.  Theyaposre not quite white any more and theyaposre definitely no longer sexy - but theyaposre just so comfy. But it looks like we should be replacing them more often than we thought. Julia says: In my opinion, a bra is at its best in its first year of being worn. How often should I wash my bra  This is something that causes of a lot of debate between women. Some will wash their bra every time they wear it, as they would with knickers, while others will wear it a number of times before popping in the laundry basket. Julia says: I would recommend washing after each use as this keeps your bra clean and fresh. What can I do with my old bras  Of course you can just pop them in the bin, but lot of shops offer a great recycling service. How do I pick the right sports bra  When it comes to buying a sports bra, lots of women find themselves a bit lost. Luckily, Julia has a few tips for finding the right one for your shape. She says: A good fitting sports bra can reduce the amount of bounce and provide extra confidence, in turn helping you make the most out of your workout.  Having the right support for your breasts during exercise is so important and provides the foundation for a great work out. Your breasts move in a figure of eight motion when youaposre running and can move up to cm in any direction during exercise so finding an impact level that bests suits your activity is key.

Lexis Noelle, , from New York,  travelled the USA and Caribbean with her mother when she was in high school. She decided she wanted to travel the world in a bus after seeing pictures on Instagram of people enjoying that nomadic way of living. She saved every penny she could from her job as a waitress — and on February ,  when she was , she found the bus of her dreams on the internet.    Lexis fell in love with the pale blue  bus she found advertised for sale on the internet and bought it after test drive. She spent two-and-a-half months superbly redesigning the bus to meet her living style. Her mini home includes a living and sleeping space, a bathroom with toilet and shower, kitchen and dining space and is powered with solar  and power stations. Sheaposs enjoying le on the road and has set up an Etsy store so she can make a living on her travels across the US — which are taking her to festivals and creative craft fairs. Lexis said: I have such a huge passion for travel and exploring new places. When I graduated from high school, I just knew I didnapost want to go right to university. Books werenapost really my thing nor was sitting around in a classroom learning about something I had no interest in. I wanted to seriously enjoy my le and I knew that travel would give me what I needed. I mean, I could always go to university later down the lineI felt like it.    When I was in high school, my mum, Tabbi, took me to all these cool places in the States and in the Carribean. It was always such a thrill to explore them all, meet new people and to see new things. We went everywhere in her vintage  travel trailer. I used to love going camping with it and after seeing her convert her shuttle bus, it left me in complete awe. I knew I had to get my own little home on wheels.  Since my mother had already completed her shuttle bus conversion and knew all the aposinsapos and aposoutsapos of converting a bus into a tiny home, I asked her to teach me what to do and where to start. It has been three years since Lexis purchased her dream home and she has never been happier or freer. She canapost wait to continue exploring new places with Lola and sometimes follows her mother with her bus.  Fast forward, Iaposm now  and Lola is truly complete. I am loving everything I get to experience from my travels and canapost wait to carry on seeking out new wonderful places. Iaposm looking forward to travelling with my mum alongside her bus too. I even have dining space, itaposs simple but sweet for dinners and includes two chairs and a slate tiled round table. I have curtains split into two so that while eating at the table Iaposm able to look outdoors to watch nature at its best.

We know that as a team.“But you ask for a reaction and you ask for character – that was there in abundance in the second half.“I thought the two boys, McDaid and Todd, coming on did really well and we looked more of a threat.“Looking back at the game now it was a game of two halves — a cliche I know — but it probably ended up a fair result.“Near the end I thought we might nick it, too.“Both McDaid and Todd have been in the mix. I like both of them, and Jamie Ness is back in the mix now, too.“It’s healthy we have him back and healthy we have those two pushing for places. That adds to the squad.”So, what are the possibilities for the Dens gaffer against Ian McCall’s Honest Men Despite an error for the second goal at Dunfermline, Jack Hamilton is the undisputed No  goalie at the club and will almost certainly retain his spot ahead of second-choice Calum Ferrie.After seeing the three-man backline perform well in a commanding performance against Inverness in the Betfred Cup the match previous, it’s clear the same line-up didn’t work at Dunfermline.Every game is dferent but should McPake switch to a back four, that’ll obviously see one centre-half drop out.The knock picked up by skipper Josh Meekings and his injury history make him favourite to miss out.Andrew Davies is nowhere near match fitness so that leaves Jordon Forster and Jordan McGhee as central defenders for this one.At full-back, Jordan Marshall did OK and will likely continue, as will Cammy Kerr on the right, though he didn’t have his best night at East End Park.A shake-up in defence would bring another midfielder into play and with McDaid, Todd and Ness all banging on the door for a starting spot, McPake has decisions to make.

Clubs have had every opportunity to put their best foot forward over the last few weeks.“Any club who is trying to deal so close to the game shows a total disregard for us, on the eve of such an important game.“Unless I am told by the chairman that a deal has been agreed and accepted, then Scott will continue to be an Aberdeen player and that is the way I am continuing to look at it.“It is hardly ideal preparation. It is a Europa League game, a very important game, and these clubs have had the whole summer to do a deal and there is a degree of anger, frustration and contempt towards these clubs for trying to put their best foot forward now.“Until somebody tells me that an offer is accepted then Scott will play tonight.“I have spoken to Scott probably more than any other player in the last couple of weeks.“He obviously has had a lot to contend with and there is a degree of sympathy from myself, but he is an Aberdeen player and he has to continue to act like an Aberdeen player and to perform for us, unless I am told dferently.“I have such a high regard for the boy.“He is the best of the lot, in terms of personality and we want the best for him.“No doubt his move and everything will come for him in his career. Whether it comes in this window, clubs have had weeks, the whole summer to put their best foot forward, to try to get him.“If it doesn’t happen in this window then I am pretty sure it will happen in the near future.”The news came at the worst possible time for McInnes, given his lack of defensive options. Mikey Devlin and Ash Taylor have been ruled out with hamstring injuries, although Devlin has travelled with the squad to Croatia for tonight’s game.McInnes is keen on bringing in Zak Vyner, a defender at one of his former clubs Bristol City, with a loan deal being pursued by the Dons.Vyner spent last season at Rotherham United and has also been out on loan at MK Dons and Shrewsbury Town, and the Robins are happy to loan him out, despite selling Adam Webster to Brighton and Hove Albion.McInnes added: “He is a player who is of interest to us, but there is no news on that at this stage.“He is a player who we’d like to bring in because of the defensive situation with injuries.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.42185727-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.42185727-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.42185727-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.42185727-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"vyner joins dons on loan ahead of rijeka tie","story":"Aberdeen have completed a loan move for Bristol City#s Zak Vyner.The -year-old defender was registered before last night#s pm UEFA transfer deadline which means he is eligible to face HNK Rijeka in the Europa League this evening.The Reds play the Croatian outfit at the Stadion Rujevica in the first leg of the Europa League third qualying round with kick-off pm."},{"url":null,"title":"even tunnel vision has its drawbacks","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOur regular artistic contributor Ann Thomas this week muses on a subject she has mulled over before # the Rest and be Thankful.Transport Scotland is undertaking a review of the country#s strategic transport strategy, with an undertaking that Argyll will be at the front of the queue this time around.We#ll see, but in the meantime a tunnel through the hills is considered by some to be the answer to solving the problem of keeping Argyll connected via the A by avoiding the landslide risk altogether.But there may be some drawbacks to a super underground highway#PIC:no_acartoon"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 14 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsBike scrambling fans out there of a certain age will be feeling nostalgic at the prospect of ato a track described as #one of the best in the world# later this month.Kilmartin is famous in the motocross world and mouths are watering at the prospect.Not that long ago,you had walked into a shop and asked for a bottle of water you would be offered fizzy French stuff or perhaps tonic or soda water.Plain drinking water  We had taps for that.A multi-million pound industry has #sprung# up, selling water to us in plastic bottles.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"ardrishaig community trust maintains partnership with lochgilphead soccer centre","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMembers of the board of Ardrishaig Community Trust turned out on Saturday July  morning to watch an exhibition game from some of the boys and girls of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre and took the time to formally renew their strategic partnership.Chair of the Trust Hamish Nicol said: #We are delighted to be associated with Lochgilphead Soccer Centre who share our values about a community approach to development.

We know our funding last season allowed well over  young players to receive new strips in the Red Star design and attend events across the UK and we look forward to watching their developments over the next season.#Ben Tustin of the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre was equally delighted and said that the Ardrishaig Community Trust #is an excellent partner for us without which we would not have been able to deliver many of our strategic objectives. We are wholly dependent on external funding and volunteers and we do receive generous funding from other organisations as well as the Trust. Players subscriptions covers pitch hire, insurance and other bits and bobs but it is the support from other organisations that allows us to be ambitious and grow not only the number of children participating but also development opportunities including bringing in professional coaches for development weekends which are free to local children.#"},{"url":null,"title":"aliens invade lochgilphead library","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowChildren at Lochgilphead Library had a fun afternoon creating their own alien friends.As part of the LiveArgyll Space Chase to keep young people reading throughout summer, the theme of space travel was expanded upon at a merry little get together, with the children making their own little alien friends out of clay.While they worked, librarian Sylvia Bolwell read them a story of a distant planet where everyone fits in.The youngsters had a lot of fun chipping in with the story and they all had a fun new friend to take home."},{"url":null,"title":"northern jolly for loch fyne anglers","story":"Nikki ThompsonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club couldn’t have asked for better weather for its annual soirée to the fertile fishing grounds of Stornoway.The crossing from Ullapool was as smooth as you like and a sure sign we were in for a good couple of days. Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

And his Tarbert roots run deeper, he was the head chef in Stonefield Castle in  where he met his we Irene, whose family still live in the village.Together with his son Ryan and Ross Payne from the Anchor Hotel the chefs settled in for an afternoon of cooking the finest seafood for the  seafood lovers who had booked their tables though the festival’s Facebook page.No one was left hungry as food started to arrive on tables and by the end of the afternoon there nothing left to cook and the chefs could have a welcome break.While the sunshine certainly added to the enjoyment of this new seafood experience Mike was delighted with the lunch service, saying: ‘It’s been a fantastic day, everyone enjoyed themselves and most of all we’ve raised over £ for the festival. We were incredibly grateful to get all, or most of the fish donated, which allowed us to give all the profits to the festival. I’d also like to thank Seafood Scotland who helped with the funding of our equipment.‘Cooking in front of the boats which caught the fish was pretty spectacular.

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many more could get this help – whether through financial charities or commercial organisations.Richard Gardiner,"},{"url":null,"title":"letter thanks","story":"I#m pleased to report the day raised £ for

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

There is no economic case for independence, especially with the SNPrsquos new position of ditching the pound and new policy of turbo-charged austerity to bear down on the deficit.:Labour would not block a second Scottish independence referendumHowever, less than an hour after this statement, Mr McDonell repeated his position during an interview at the Edinburgh Fringe with the journalist Graham Spiers.He said: \"What I said yesterday, that was not picked up, is actually what I want is a Labour Government, and let us demonstrate as a Labour Government what we can do to transform peoples lives.\"And , after a few years, people want to come back and say they want to test the water on an independence referendum then fair enough, thats up to the Scottish people and the Scottish Parliament. Im not here to block a democratic exercise by any means.\"He added: \"For me, the priority is a Labour Government. If the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people determine that they want another referendum, Im not being set up by Nicola Sturgeon because thats what shes trying to do.\"Shes trying to say its the big bad English yet again trying to prevent us holding a referendum.\"No were not. What were saying is its unnecessary. We will campaign against having a referendum, but we are not using parliamentary devices to block it mdash its as simple as that.\"Put to him that this was a change in Labours policy, Mr McDonnell said: \"Thats the debate we are now having about how we go forward.\"My view is we shouldnt be allowed in this way to be manipulated by Nicola Sturgeon in that referendum debate, by trying to accuse a UK parliament of blocking the will of the Scottish people.\"He later added: ldquoIt shouldnrsquot be down to English parliamentarians to block the will of the Scottish people.\"Mr McDonnell said he had made his position clear in interviews over the last three years.And he said Jeremy Corbyn had also expressed the view that a referendum should not be blocked.The latest comments are a double humiliation for Mr Leonard, and have provoked widespread anger in the party.A dozen Scottish Labour general election candidates have now released a joint statement insisting they ldquooppose another independence referendum.Martin Whitfield, Labour MP for East Lothian, said it was ldquodeeply disappointing that John McDonnell has doubled down on his desire to ignore the partyrsquos manesto, and branded it ldquoan insult to Richard Leonard and the entire Scottish Labour Party, which is working hard to win back the trust of voters and help elect a Labour Government at Westminster.Daniel Johnson, Labour MSP for Edinburgh Southern, said the comments had \"frustrated many Scottish Labour supporters\".He said: ldquoThe party is fully behind Richard Leonard in opposing a second independence referendum, which was our pledge at the last election and remains our commitment to voters.In March, Mr Leonard insisted a future Labour government would block a second referendum, eventhe Scottish Parliament requested the Section  power to hold it.But he apparently failed to make the shadow chancellor change his mind after their meeting yesterday morning.Nor did Mr Leonard repeat his March position in his statement, suggesting he has now backtracked on it.Speaking at the Fringe event, Mr McDonnell claimed Mr Leonard \"understands where Im coming from\".:Richard Leonard meets John McDonnell amid Labour row over independence voteElsewhere, the shadow chancellor once again ruled out any pact or coalition \"whatsoever\" with the SNP or any other party.He said he would not have a working arrangement with the SNP \"because were a socialist party they are not\".He added: \"My own view - I think theyre Tories, its as simple as that, and I always have thought that.\"It came as Nicola Sturgeon said Labour is the \"stumbling block\" to forming a progressive alliance to halt the Conservatives.The First Minister said she does not envisage any formal coalition with Labour but wants the SNP to be part of a \"progressive alternative\" to the Tories at Westminster.She said: \"The stumbling block to that is Labour - Labour are still on the fence on Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn is abdicating his position of leadership by not giving that clear direction.\"So we need to get Labour off the fence and then we can look to stopping Boris Johnson in his tracks, hopefully.\"The latest row comes after a poll earlier this week showed support for Scottish independence has risen to  per cent, with % against. Among Labour supporters, a third said they would vote Yes.Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson accused Labour of planning \"a pact with the SNP in order to parachute Jeremy Corbyn into Number \".She said: ldquoThe fact is this - Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would happily sell Scotland down the riverthey thought it could give them a snf of power.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-labour-branch-office-tea-making-intern","story":"Nicola Sturgeon started the ball rolling with a sit down with LBCrsquos Iain Dale, followed by the Scottish Conservatives leader, Ruth Davidson, in conversation with another host.

One step forward for the caring, sharing society, two steps back for feminism: discuss.John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, had his own show-stopping routine.

Other views were available, he added.Too right they are. In its manesto for the  General Election the party said it would not support indyref. The Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, on the rare occasions he surfaces to give an interview, has repeated the assertion. The UK leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has done a Brexit on the matter, saying he will make up his mindand when a request was made. Opposing another referendum is not a whim, it is a central pillar of Scottish Labourrsquos pitch to the people, one that Mr McDonnell smashed with a wrecking ball.Whether he acted initially from ignorance, carelessness, or both, he doubled down on his position yesterday, leaving the party in Scotland looking even weaker and more irrelevant. This is worse than being treated like a branch office. Scottish Labour now looks like the unpaid intern to Labour in London, hanging around waiting for a chance to make the tea.: McDonnell ignores LeonardThere is another explanation for his less than soft shoe shuffle into Scottish political territory. He is not the only one trying to make new friends ahead of the great September showdown in the Commons. While Mr McDonnell was speaking in Edinburgh, the First Minister was in Glasgow telling an audience that ldquosome kind of progressive alliance between the SNP and Labour to lock the Tories out of Government would not be the worst idea that she had ever heard.The Scottish Tories have been gleeful, seeing this as a chance to haul out those old posters of Ed Miliband in the pocket of Alex Salmond and get busy Photoshopping. That any deal would be received badly in south of the border was clear from the headline in the English edition of the Daily Mail, which went for ldquoLabour gets into bed with the SNP, while the Scottish edition plumped for ldquoIrsquod help Corbyn get keys to No , admits Sturgeon.: Bank chief warns of Brexit painFrom Ms Sturgeonrsquos side, a deal with Labour would be a certain path to another independence referendum, particularly tempting in the wake of the Ashcroft poll showing : in favour of Yes,not to her then to many in the partyrsquos increasingly impatient ranks.Any SNP-Labour alliance would destroy the Labour Party in Scotland. While that might seem to opponents to be merely hastening a process already underway, or even just punishment for past misdemeanours and arrogance, they should be careful what they wish for. As many a non-Brexit related issue shows, whether it be in the building of a childrenrsquos hospital or exam results, the last thing this Scottish Government, any Scottish Government, needs is less scrutiny.Having a Scottish party propping up a UK government also takes us into choppy constitutional waters. It is clear after the votes on abortion and same sex marriage in Northern Ireland that the SNP takes a more casual approach to voting on devolved matters than previously stated. Even so, how soon would it be before a Labour Government asked for help above and beyond supply and confidence, say  Having bent its own principles once, would the SNP be tempted to be flexible again  Looking at it from another direction, would the SNP really vote down a Labour Government Not for the first time, politicians, in Scotland and further afield, need to acquire a sense of perspective, fast, as the Brexit deadline looms. The sense of disillusionment among the electorate with politics and its practitioners is palpable. To watch Mr McDonnell and Ms Sturgeon engage in megaphone diplomacy with each other is hardly dignied and may ultimately prove to be premature and unwise.: Labour accused of betrayalWith no hope of cool heads in Downing Street as a no deal Brexit looms, it is up to others to make the best of a possibly calamitous situation. Labour and the SNP have parts to play in that, but so do other iniduals and parties.

The CHP engine generates heat for the public buildings and electricity for the sewage plant and the waste water heat pumps.The heat from waste water technology, provided by SHARC Energy Systems, uses a heat recovery unit to separate liquid and solid waste, which is ed to the treatment process.A heat exchanger transfers the heat from the waste water to the clean water using a closed loop system.A heat pump increases the temperature of the water, which is then delivered to the district heat network.The average temperature of the heat in waste water is between  and  degrees centigrade.The heating network will include the Peak Leisure Centre, Forthbank Stadium, St Modanrsquos High School and organisations such as Zero Waste Scotland and Volunteer Scotland.Scottish Water chief executive Douglas Millican said: ldquoSustainability is vital for homes, businesses and services, and using the energy from waste water is a great example of using resources to their maximum benefit.ldquoThis new scheme in Stirling will go a long way towards helping reduce our carbon footprint and protecting the environment.Leader of Stirling Council, Scott Farmer, said: ldquoMaking Stirling the first place in the UK to harness this mix of cutting-edge renewable technologies shows Stirling Council is determined to lead the way on tackling climate change by reducing our carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.ldquoThis innovative initiative will deliver cost-saving benefits to the council and residents, generate additional income for many years to come and benefit communities in the form of regeneration and jobs in the growing renewables sector.Several public and private sector organisations are working to wean Scotland off gas-only heating.:Prince Charles opens Scotlandrsquos biggest ever offshore wind farmElectric heat pumps ndash essentially reverse fridges ndash are being developed on an industrial scale across the planet.In Clydebank, local authorities hope to use pumps to capitalise on the relative warmth of the local river to heat a new neighbourhood.

The truth is, though, thatgames have the power to turn a player emotionally upside down, which they now do, then theyrsquove reached that place in our culture already.My praise doesnrsquot come lightly ndash I worship at the altar of the novel. I write novels. To me therersquos no higher art form. My heroes donrsquot kick balls or play guitar, they create worlds and ideas for me to lose myself in, to learn about people and places Irsquod never otherwise understand.The novel, like cinema and the best television, hits you once in the heart, and then again in the head. It works on you at both an intellectual and emotional level. What makes any art form art is that it draws out feelings and thoughts yoursquod never otherwise have experienced, it opens doorways into other worlds, lives, minds.Art is an edying experience, in the true meaning of the word it builds our interior world, and without our interior world wersquod be no dferent to animals. Art gives meaning to our shared humanity. By any fair standard, I believe that gaming can now call itself art.Games are no longer mere entertainment or rather games at their very best are no longer mere entertainment. Games have become capable of epic story-telling, of passing on moral truths, of changing you emotionally.Many readers will shake their heads, but let me give you an example. All year Irsquove eked out a game called Red Dead Redemption , the way I eke out novels I love and cannot bear to end. RDR is a western on a grand scale. It tells the story of a gang of outlaws at the twilight of the Old West trying to live a le already consigned to history. Itrsquos got the spirit of John Huston and Sam Peckinpah ndash echoing with their films The Searchers and The Wild Bunch. It has the verbal dexterity and character depth of HBOrsquos Deadwood series, and the melancholy and menace of novels like John Williamsrsquo Butchers Crossing and EL Doctorowrsquos Welcome to Hard Times.If that all sounds macho, then I have to be honest and say, yes, many games still feel traditionally male. RDR isnrsquot macho, though, despite its setting. Itrsquos rich in strong female characters. The most powerful figure in the entire story is a woman bounty hunter. The men arenrsquot mindless thugs, they have souls, emotions. The world is peopled with beggars, tycoons, the disabled, the lonely, the elderly, orphans, poets, scientists, journalists, doctors, shopkeepers itrsquos culturally rich with the newspapers of the day, the political dogma of the day from eugenics to communism, vaudeville, songs, folklore.Often the best games are female-led, like The Walking Dead, where you play a young girl trying to survive the apocalyptic end of the world. Here, therersquos no shooting and running. Everything is about emotion and decision. Will you help this person  Will you hoard this food  Should you trust that adult I played this game with my daughter when she was . At the end, we were both crying like babies. It had the emotional effect of something like the final scenes of Titanic or Beaches. Those two films are a good measure for the level of art Irsquom talking about in games. Itrsquos not Shakespeare - thatrsquos not what Irsquom saying. Great games are like a well-made play, novel or movie. Thatrsquos good enough when it comes to the ambition of most artists.I knew RDR was quite literally a game-changer about half-way through. Therersquos a point when the character you play ndash maybe the better phrase would be ldquoinhabit ndash develops a cough. Eventually, the character, called Arthur Morgan, a mix of gentility, violence, kindness and cynicism, is given a terminal diagnosis of tuberculosis.Irsquom not exaggerating when I say I was genuinely upset. There were tears in my eyes. It may sound absurd, but then saying  and some years ago that you cried over a silent movie probably seemed absurd too.I felt the way I do when a character Irsquove come to identy closely with in a novel dies. I didnrsquot want it to happen. I was angry with the creators. I stopped playing RDR for a few weeks because I didnrsquot want to watch Arthur Morgan suffer.What an incredible emotional effect, I realised. It made me think of some of my strongest reactions to other art forms. I remember first reading Hubert Selby Jnrrsquos Last Exit to Brooklyn as a student and being so outraged at the violence and cruelty in the book that I physically bit it and threw it at the wall, vowing never to read it again. Today, I read that book once a year, as it remains for me one of the most powerful pieces of th century literature ever written.Irsquom not equating RDR with Last Exit to Brooklyn. Even at its best, the computer game cannot reach the level of the novel, and probably never will, nor ever can. It is, after all, a dferent form of art. The novel will never be opera, and painting will never be dance. Gaming must be looked at as an art form on its own terms, but it assuredly can at least now be acknowledge as a form of art in its own right.As an aside, Scotland had a role to play in the development of this new and most st century of art forms. RDR was created by Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games has its own Scottish arm ndash Rockstar North, headquartered in Dundee, a thriving hub of a global games industry now bigger than cinema.If Scotland is clever and nurtures this industry, we could one day have our own little Hollywood on the Tay, and all the cultural clout that comes with leading a new art form into a still young century.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snp-betraying-many-scots-remain-voters","story":"We did decide.In  the \"sovereign will\" of the Scottish people was made known in a democratic vote.

Efforts to improve energy efficiency are thwarted by sash and case single glazed windows. Ask anyone who owns a townhouse or large tenement flat in Glasgowrsquos west end about their heating bill. Is it just part of the experience of owning such a property, or because itrsquos just ldquonot the done thing to alter the look of a historic building We can try our damnedest to hold back the weathering of time through complex, authoritarian planning rules ndash and it remains inconceivable to the lsquointelligentsiarsquo that a Victorian terrace in the cityrsquos west end should have solar , particularly on a high profile, street-facing elevation.We donrsquot have our priorities straight. If you have the time, money and inclination to go for it , the planning rules should take into account the signicant benefits this represents for for the planet ndash not what may be to the detriment of the ocular sensitivities of the highbrow beholder.Derek MacDonald is joint Managing Director of Newton Property Management.For more information on Newtons  vision please visitwww.newtonpropertyThe HeraldrsquosClimate for Changeinitiative supports efforts being made by the ScottishGovernmentwith key organisations and campaign partners.

It shouldnrsquot just be a binary referendum, and wersquoll be backing that option.Ahead of the  referendum, then Tory Prime Minister David Cameron gave the SNP government a free hand on the question, timing and franchise for the referendum.It allowed Alex Salmond to decide on a Yes No format, and to campaign as Yes.:Ruth Davidson accuses Labour of rank betrayal over independence referendumMr Sweeneyrsquos remarks suggest a Labour government would take a very dferent approach and try to set the terms on a second vote.However a federal system, in which the regions of England were also given new powers alongside the devolved nations, could depend on votes passing where in the UK.As that could not be guaranteed, a Scottish vote for a federal system might go nowhere.When the last Labour government tried to move towards a federal system in  with an elected assembly for North East England, voters rejected it - in a referendum.Labour MSP Neil Findlay, Mr Corbyns campaign manager in the partys leadership contest, also said it would be \"democratic\" to allow Indyrefthere was a mandate for it.However he said there should also be a \"confirmatory vote of the Scottish people\" on the outcome of any independence negotiations.He told BBC Radio Scotland: \"I donrsquot want a second referendum. I would campaign against it. I would campaign against independence as vocerously as I did the last time.ldquoHowevertherersquos a majority in the Scottish Parliament and parties have stood on a manesto saying that they will have a referendum, andthose parties get a majority, then I think itrsquos just democratic to say that they would then be allowed to negotiate with the UK government to have that referendum.ldquoI think in that process, any negotiated that they had would have to come back to a confirmatory vote of the Scottish people.\"The pairwerespeaking after Scottish Labour was convulsed by a row over whether to allow a second independence referendum sparked by shadow chancellor John McDonnell.In two appearances on the Edinburgh Fringe this week, he said a Labour government at Westminster would not block a referendumHolyrood asked for it.He said: \"It will be for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people to decide that. We would not block something like that.ldquoWe would let the Scottish people decide. Thats democracy.That flatly contradicted Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, who in March said that Labour would block Indyref, evena majority MSPs requested it.: John McDonnell ignores Richard Leonard and keeps independence referendum on the tableDespite Mr Leonard meeting Mr McDonnell on Wednesday morning and stressing the  vote should be a once-in-a-generation event, Mr McDonnell stuck to his position.He said: ldquoIf, after a few years, people want to come back and say they want to test the water on an independence referendum then fair enough, thatrsquos up to the Scottish people and the Scottish Parliament. Irsquom not here to block a democratic exercise by any means.ldquoIrsquom not being set up by Nicola Sturgeon because thatrsquos what shersquos trying to do.ldquoShersquos trying to say itrsquos the big bad English yet again trying to prevent us holding a referendum. No wersquore not. What wersquore saying is itrsquos unnecessary.ldquoWe will campaign against having a referendum, but we are not using parliamentary devices to block it - itrsquos as simple as that.The Tory government has so far refused to grant Holyrood the power to hold a referendum under Section  of the  Scotland Act."},{"url":null,"title":"david-mundell-independence-majority-holyrood-2021-spark-referendum","story":"The former Scottish Secretary said Downing Street would have to listenthe Scottish Parliament poll in  is fought ldquoexplicitly on the issue.He made the comments as he confirmed he would not vote down a Conservative Government to prevent a no-deal Brexit, despite raising concerns it could threaten the future of the UK.Mr Mundell was speaking at a Fringe by the Sea event in North Berwick, where he was being interviewed by the journalist Katy Balls.He said: ldquoI thinkthe  Scottish Parliament election is fought explicitly on the issue of another referendum, and then there is a majority of nationalist parties, then evidently you do have to listen to that.ldquoThe  Scottish Parliament election wasnrsquot fought on that basis ndash it was sort of a subset of the SNP manesto.ldquoIn my view the wording they put there was deliberately ambiguous, so as to allow them to not major on independence but then claim they had a mandate for independence.ldquoButthe  Scottish Parliament election is fought on an explicit independence referendum basis, then itrsquos harder to push back against the idea that there is a mandate.Mr Mundell has previously said the Holyrood poll is shaping up to be a ldquoreferendum on a referendum.And he indicated Unionist candidates should form tactical alliances to beat pro-independence parties.He said: ldquoI think as we head into the  Scottish Parliament elections, which will ultimately be a referendum on whether therersquos another referendum, then all Unionist forces have to think about how they best organise themselves for that election.The former Scottish Secretary, who was sacked by Boris Johnson last month as part of his brutal cabinet reshuffle, has repeatedly warned about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit.But askedwould accept crashing out of the EU without a deal, he said: ldquoI think that we have to have a Brexit rather than no Brexit.ldquoSo Irsquom clear that that is an important principle.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland.

Understandably, she declared there was “growing urgency” for Scotland to become independent because it faced being “dragged down a political path we don’t want to go”.Cue much licking of SNP lips at thoughts of a No Deal disaster, sweeping gains at a General Election as Scottish Labour’s tailspin turns into a screaming e, victory in a second independence vote next year and,the last prospectus was anything to go by, the  Scottish parliament elections to be for the first independent Scottish legislature. But some pro-independence commentators have begun to question the assumption that Boris Johnson is a gt and a No Deal departure will be the best precursor to separation. It is unquestionably true that the SNP does not want a No Deal exit, but then neither does the UK government, but is a soft Brexit like that agreed by ex-Prime Minister Theresa May really a path Ms Sturgeon doesn’t want to do down For the SNP, it could be the best of both worlds: it would still be Brexit, so Scotland will have been “dragged out the EU against its will” but with customs and regulations aligned the UK would have to play by EU rules over which it had no control. Under those circumstances the SNP would argue an independent Scotland back in the EU would give Scotland a say and with no adverse effect on rUK trade.No Deal is the reverse, where an independent Scotland going back into the EU would mean trade barriers, virtual or otherwise, where none currently exist because automatic harmonisation will have ended and the Irish question becomes the Scottish question. With four times as much Scottish trade going to the rest of the UK than to Europe, whatever the economic impact of the UK leaving the EU it would be four times as greatScotland left the UK.These febrile times are leading to a loss of grip and perspective, like Labour’s John McDonnell who promised yesterday that Labour would let the Scottish parliament decide whether there should be a second independence referendum, which it already has, even referring to Westminster as the “English parliament”. In one-garrulous Fringe chat show, Scottish Labour’s election pledge is now for Indyref , much to the dismay of Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray.Even in the parliamentary recess, the momentum towards an autumn election is accelerating because with no sign of European willingness to renegotiate the alternatives are a new parliament and a change of government or a No Deal departure on October .With his working majority down to one, the chances of a No Confidence vote when Westminster reconvenes in September are high, but Mr Johnson is not compelled to call an election and instead has  days to demonstrate he can form a new government which commands a majority. Onlythat fails must an election be called, so it is not unfeasible for an election to be after October  by which time the UK will have left the EU without a deal.The Conservative position of honouring the results of the  and  referenda and opposing re-runs of both has the benefit of consistency and for the sake of the Union Scottish Conservatives have no alternative but to get right behind the UK government and be ready for November .

The goodwill for such agreements was there, she added.It is easy to see the appeal of such agreements for those voters who believe that Brexit – especially the no-deal iety now envisaged by the Prime Minister – represents a catastrophic act of self-harm. If Swinson and the leaders of other avowedly anti-Brexit parties could reach agreements in key constituencies across the UK to stand only the candidate with the greatest chance of winning then, surely, the chances of the Johnson project being stopped in its tracks would be greatly enhanced.There are just one or two small hurdles in the way…The first of these is the fact that, although speculation runs feverishly, Johnson has not yet called a general election.It’s certainly true that many Conservative Party MPs would like the new PM to capitalise on a boost in the polls to try to increase their numbers at Westminster, but others believe this might be a risky strategy. If Nigel Farage’s Brexit Partysplits the right-wing Eurosceptic vote, then a snap election could bring the Johnson premiership to a sudden end.But let us imagine that Johnson goes down the general election route before the current Brexit deadline of  October and that Swinson sets about trying to build an anti-Brexit coalition. She might have been able to persuade Plaid and the Greens to step aside in a single by-election, but would these parties really be so keen to lay down their electoral chances across the country  Would they risk, by seeing their overall votes in a general election diminish severely, becoming less politically relevant And what about the SNP, every bit as opposed to Brexit as the Lib Dems  There are fewer seats in Scotland where anti-Brexit parties risk splitting the vote than there are in England, but one of them – East Dunbartonshire – is Swinson’s own.Swinson served as MP for that constituency between - and was then defeated by the SNP’s John Nicolson. She took the seat back in , largely, I suspect because of Nicolson’s unpopularity. But with a more impressive candidate, the SNP would surely have a fighting chance of snatching it back. The removal of the leader of the Liberal Democrats from the House of Commons would represent quite a scalp for the nationalists. Can you imagine Nicola Sturgeon passing up the opportunity to see off Swinson  I can’t. And nor would I blame the SNP leader for committing signicant resources to bringing down Swinson. Politics is a contact sport and Swinson is a major target. The suggestion from her that the SNP should give her a clear run at the seat would, rightly, be met with derision.Jo Swinson is not the only party leader now talking about pacts. Brexit Party leader Farage has raised the prospect of deals with the Conservatives, particularly in the north of England, to ensure the election of Eurosceptic MPs.Given the result of the  referendum, any such agreements would surely guarantee the evisceration of any anti-Brexit candidates in those areas.Yes, electoral pacts might be made to work for pro-EU parties but they could just as easily be the secret of Brexiteer success.Those now clamouring for agreements to be struck between the Lib Dems and other parties which take the same position on EU membership should, I think, be careful that they are not wishing for the creation of two-horse races in key constituencies across the country. That scenario would risk strengthening rather than weakening the Brexiteers’ squad at Westminster.Johnson is supported by a team in government that is fully committed to Brexit by  October at any cost. The PM will gladly sacrice the best interests of the UK economy to protect himself.This being so, and with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour still embarrassingly weak on the matter of Brexit, the idea that the Johnson project might be stopped is an appealing one to those of us who would dearly like to see Brexit cancelled at this late stage.But I fear that any plan to run a single anti-Brexit candidate in a constituency would be met with a plan to run a single pro-Brexit candidate. Jiggery-pokery would be fought with jiggery-pokery.It is abundantly clear that Brexiteers won the  referendum with a campaign strewn with lies. Their promises of an effortless, painless departure from the EU have long since been exposed.But rather than turning against campaign leaders, pro-Brexit voters appear to be hardening their positions and cheering on a damaging no-deal departure.It may now be obvious that Brexit is going to be dficult to deliver. But stopping it will be harder still.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish independence labour backed referendum would contain third federal option","story":"A future Scottish independence referendum backed by Labour would contain a third option on federalism, it has emerged.Shadow Scotland office minister Paul Sweeney insisted that it was not a \"binary\" issue as party continues to reel from the shock of Shadow Chancellor John McDonnells revelation this week that it would not block a second vote on Scots leaving the UK.But Labours Edinburgh MSP Daniel Johnson insisted that the sht in position has created a crisis in the party.Read more: Labour at war over split on Scottish independence vote Mr Sweeney, the Glasgow North East MP, told BBC Radio Scotland a Labour government would deliver “a radical transformation and federate the United Kingdom”.

Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

annual Féile an Phobail, the visual arts programme continues to attract record numbers through its doors at its base in St Mary’s University College.This year’s programme is packed full of exhibiting artists and groups represented throughout Ireland and worldwide through a range of mediums and topics including paintwork, sculpture and installations.Artists on display range from Aidan Monaghan, Andrew Whitson, Micheál Gallagher, acclaimed music photographer Conor Kerr and David Bell.Féile Operations and Events Co-ordinator Áine McCabe described the week-long event as “one that people don’t want to miss”.“I recently joined Féile, just after Christmas, and it’s been a baptism of fire,” she laughed. “Having been involved with Féile for many years, whether as a participant or volunteer, it’s a completely dferent ball game seeing behind the scenes and what goes in year on year to put the festival on in all its guises.“We have Deirdre Mackel and Micheál Gallagher working for months to bring together the exhibition, to bring together the dferent genres of art and it’s great to see so many repeat artists coming back. It’s really invaluable having Deirdre and Micheál onboard and it was incredible to see so much of an eclectic mix of people at the launch. Art and creativity is very much part of the foundation of Féile.”Aisling Award winner Deirdre Mackel has spent six years at the helm of the visual arts exhibition having previously become involved as an exhibitor. “I have seen the exhibition grow over the years, it’s brilliant to be a part of, to see the amount of people coming in and just taking their time to see the art works,” she said. “It just really warms my heart to see all the art up in St Mary’s.”Deirdre spoke of the amount of preparation that goes into the artistic showcase each year. “There is a lot of background work, the call that goes out for artists to display in the first instance. When you see people coming in and installing their art works it’s just magical. You really get a sense of what it means on launch night which we had last Wednesday, seeing what it means to people, to the artist it lts my spirits. Debuting artists would say ‘I’m so nervous’ and they come back year after year, the exhibition really encourages new artist development and another thing that comes out of it is a real sense of volunteering.”Deirdre continued: “Local artist Micheál Gallagher has also come on board and the team have been very much hands on deck. We have some really stand-out pieces from the West Belfast Arts Society, Richard Kelly and a focal point is always the Relatives for Justice Remembrance Quilt. We have a series of Civil Rights posters which were exhibited in the Tate Modern and now they have been brought to Féile.“We are seeing a lot of the artists coming here with their families and staying for the duration of the festival. The visual arts exhibit gains more and more momentum year on year.” The Féile Visual Arts Exhibition will be on display until Thursday, August . All are welcome to attend."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"shock at sudden passing of reds legend breslin","story":"THE local football community was plunged into mourning last night at the sudden passing of Cltonville legend Tommy Breslin at the age of .The former Reds player and manager died while on a family holiday in Spain.Breslin famously guided Cltonville to back-to-back Irish League titles in  and  and won eight trophies in a hugely successful four-year spell at Solitude.In the summer of , he was at the helm when Cltonville took on Celtic over two legs in an historic Champions League Qualier.He ed to the club on an interim basis following the departure of his successor Gerard Lyttle at the end of the  campaign while he was also a revered midfielder in his playing days at the club.Social media was awash with tributes last night as fans and rival supporters alike paid tribute to one of the game’s most affable and popular figures.Having updated their social media feeds to include a picture of their iconic former boss, Cltonville posted a statement which read: “Cltonville Football Club are devastated to this evening learn of the sudden and untimely death of Tommy Breslin.“While the club will naturally pay a fuller tribute to Tommy very soon, at the moment in time our thoughts are very much with the Breslin family circle and all of his many friends, to whom we extend our deepest sympathy.”Lyttle, who was also part of Breslin’s backroom team before taking over the Cltonville hotseat, tweeted: “Shocked and saddened to hear – one of the nicest men I’ve ever known.

To play in West Belfast, the atmosphere was really incredible, it was emotional.”Joby said that he is “looking forward” to sharing a stage with all who are on the ‘Greatest Hits’ bill come August .“They are good friends of mine and have all influenced me one way or another over the years, West Belfast is overflowing with talent.”A roadie “lting gear at the back of the Ulster Hall for U and the Horselips”, Joby was heavily influenced by his brother Martin and his mother Mary. “The house always had music in it,” he says.“The night at the Cultúrlann will be informal, I’ll be telling a few stories of some of the songs that I’ve written, telling of my musical adventures from when I was kid. The first song I ever wrote was Belfast when I was . Ten years later we were in the British charts, that song has really resonated with people,” he said.He continued: “I was doing a gig with Iain Archer in the Oh Yeah Centre recently and he told me that Belfast was the song that made him believe that he could have a career in music, it really took me back to hear that from him as he is credited with writing Run with Snow Patrol. He said that Energy Orchard inspired him to get into music. You never know what a song can do for a person.”Joby spoke of how much he is looking forward to getting “those characters” his musical compadres in the one room come the end of the month at the Devenish event.“Rab McCullough’s guitar playing, the energy of Baraka really rubbed off on us. On the sleeve of the first Energy Orchard album we thanked Rab and Malachy McCambridge, the keyboard player, for giving us the blues. Those days up in the Club-house on the Glen Road, they were days we’ll never forget, it was electrying. The angst of the Troubles, that pent up anger everything was exorcised on a weekly basis through Baraka’s performances.“This month is going to be a memorable one, I’m looking forward to seeing Brianon the night at the Devenish who’d be a good friend of mine. It will be a real celebration.”An Evening with Joby Fox takes place on Friday August  in Cultúrlann.

It insisted it “never wanted to leave Interrail”.But Eurail Group managing director Carlo Boselli declared the RDG’s attempt to “secure a competitive position” for its BritRail pass had led them to “pull out” of Interrail and Eurail.Britain keeps all the proceeds from BritRail purchases, whereas those from Interrail and Eurail are shared with other countries.Despite this not being related to leaving the EU  even though it doesnt primarily impact on UK citizens, it will make it harder for everyone  to explore the UK.

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"derry motocross racer owes great deal air ambulance","story":"A Co.

Eoghan had a seizure and was sedated by the HEMS team at the scene before being transferred by the air ambulance to Royal Victoria Hospital.The Dungiven man’s injuries were all down the right side and he had an open fracture in his leg, his femur was shattered, and he had broken ribs and a bruised lung.Speaking about the accident, Eoghan’s we Kerrie said: “Standing on the side-lines and watching the accident was one of the worst moments I’ve ever experience, I really thought Eoghan was going to die.“Eoghan had a seizure at the scene which was incredibly frightening but when I saw the air ambulance coming into land my anxiety reduced. Within minutes of the HEMS team arriving, all the craziness seemed to calm, and I just felt so much more at easy as the team were so professional.”As part of his recovery, Eoghan visited the air ambulance base, and the home of the Air Ambulance Northern Irelandcharity, in Lisburn to meet the team who had helped him.He updated them on his recovery, saying: “I’m still undergoing treatment for my injuries and will have to have surgery on my kneecap which has unfortunately been damaged beyond repair. But I’m here and I’m on the road to recovery and every week there is further improvement.“I owe a great deal to all of the medical professionals who helped, and continue to help, me and I’m feeling positive about the future.”Kerrie added: “As a family, we know just how important the air ambulance service is and in recognition of this, we held a fundraiser in November last year and raised £, for the charity. We wanted to extend a heartfelt thanks to every single person who contributed in any way to help.“We are forever grateful for what AANI has done for us and couldn’t imagine what the outcome may have beenthey were not available.”The charity, AANI in partnership with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service , provides the Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicefor the region and responds to seriously ill or injured patients, seven days a week, for twelve hours a day.AANI requires £, per day to keep this vital service going, meaning £million must be raised each year.You can support the charity by joining Club AANI, an exclusive members club, for a weekly donation of £.

This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

But, there is no doubt that your body slows down. My ability to see was greatly affected.“As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.”Undoubtedly, it was Margaret Thatcher more than anyone  within the British establishment at the time who demonstrated complete determination to use the protests in Long Kesh to ide and break the republican movement.Many commentators have pointed to the INLA assassination of her colleague Airey Neave in  as one reason why the British Prime Minister embarked on a path of total intransigence towards the IRA. However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"trade union blasts delusional derry employers treatment frontline workers","story":"A public sector trade union has blasted “unscrupulous” local employers for their “arrogant” mistreatment of workers.UNISON activists attended the recent NIHE Public consultation standardised regional payment rates event in the City Hotel to provide a voice for frontline workers employed through the Supporting People Programme.Earlier this year Derry City  Strabane District Council unanimously backed a motion in support of workers’ rights.The Supporting People programme, which has been operating since , provides housing support services delivered in partnership with service providers across the public, private and voluntary sectors.Support is provided to more than , vulnerable people every year, to enable them to live independently in their own homes, sheltered housing or in supported housing accommodation.Client groups include, Women’s Aid, the House in the Wells, Cheshire House, the Shepherds View Young Parents Project, Francis Street Young Persons Project, Apex Housing - Beechway House and the Simon Community.Its broad objectives are to achieve a better quality of le for vulnerable people, allowing them to live independently and maintain their tenancies. To provide housing support services to prevent problems that can often lead to hospitalisation, institutional care or homelessness.And finally, to assist with a smooth transition to those leaving an institutional environment to independent living.Following a review of the Supporting People programme by the Department for Communities in , it was recommended that payment rates across all Supporting People providers should be standardised.The new rates are supposed to ensure all schemes represent value for money.However, UNISON Community Branch members have questioned the commitment of certain employers within the sector.Niall McCarroll, UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said: “The Supporting People Programme has at its core the fundamental desire to improve the quality of le of those in our communities who need housing related support at any particular time.“However, the standards of living and quality of le frontline workers are experiencing does not reflect the work they complete, as a result of substandard terms and conditions of employment increasingly pushing them into debt, putting them at risk of homelessness and forcing them to use foodbanks.”‘Amoral employers’The UNISON delegation attending the Public Consultation impressed upon the NIHE that the current measures in place to protect frontline workers were inadequate and gave “unscrupulous employers” too much power. “Power which they use to disadvantage many workers whilst their inner circles led lavish lestyles on enhance contracts of employment,” Mr McCarroll added.He said the decision-making on how to manage staffing is at the behest of Supporting People funded organisations, this needs to change.UNISON told the NIHE that the current consultation process in place, designed to improve service delivery for vulnerable people would achieve nothing and fall short of any objectives,frontline staff were not valued and respected within the programme.The NIHE estimate that frontline workers should be in receipt of band  hourly rates with no mention of other band  terms and conditions such as sick pay or sht allowances. UNISON challenged this benchmarking estimate and its lack of detail in other areas, stating this was not the reality for many Supporting People Programme workers.Mr McCarroll continued: “A UNISON delegation of frontline workers will be meeting with the NIHE to further discuss our members’ concerns and we thank the NIHE for agreeing to continue the discussions on how best to protect and value workers, not forgetting that we are all involved in this programme to work together changing the lives of vulnerable people.“UNISON would like to put on record our appreciation of the position and approach taken by the NIHE in engaging with the trade unions and our continued disappointment at the right wing, anti-trade union position and approach taken by some Supporting People funded employers.“These employers operate with an arrogant, delusionary sense of entitlement, the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign will expose these employers and continue to organise workers to stand up and fight, bringing to an end the increasingly shaky gravy train which stops only at head office, bypassing frontline services.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Head office staff receive  months full sick pay while frontline workers receive just  week in any year.  This particular contractual entitlement along with signicant dferences in take home pay is leaving frontline workers feeling undervalued.\"A NIHE spokesperson said the objective of the consultation is to hear the views of service providers, current and potential service users and their families and carers to enable the Housing Executive to identy the best option and approach for implementing this recommendation.The consultation runs for  weeks, it began on  June  and ends  August .Interested stakeholders are invited to participate by completing an online questionnaire at: https:consultations.nidirect.gov.uk nihe-supporting-people srpr"},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth carnival 2019 event celebrates","story":"Moon landers : Olivia Garrod , Harry Smithand Izzy Owen ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt drop in on Machynllltspan classtruncate-full-screengteth Carnival.

That total and then some was passed in no time and has now risen above the pound, mark which has delighted Jeff.ldquoMany thanks to all the sponsors, supporters, players, umpires and scorers, Jeff enthused.ldquoThanks also to Liz Byrne, Jackie Wilson and Dave Crudgington who ran the refreshments and food made by chef Ryan Finnegan. We just couldnrsquot have achieved our target without the help of a lot of people and I can never thank them enough, he added.Sunday was an emotional day for Jeff and he was at times reduced to the odd wee tear.ldquoRodney Hassardrsquos tribute had me close to breaking down, but I was able to hold it together. I got my wish of playing alongside a lot of my former team-mates and I am indebted to them all for turning up and sharing the occasion with me.In the first challenge game of the day Dundrumrsquos current first team took on a squad of former Dundrum players that included Alan Mills and Darren Oldroyd, from Drumaness, Mark Yeates, from Downpatrick, and Byron Woodruff, from Saintfield.The game was competitive to say the least and thanks to decent knocks from Terry Hutley , Stuart Campbelland Sean CameronDundrum posted .Yeates sent the stumps cartwheeling on two occasions with Oldroyd also picking up two wickets. Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for . McNerlin, Keba Butler, Neil Reilly and Peter Calvert all got one wicket apiece.Dundrum got a steady start from Greg Hutleyand Rodney Hassard before Drumanessrsquo Neil Gelston removed them both. Oldroyd then hit the middle stump with successive deliveries leaving Dundrum on  for .McNerlin hit Gelston straight over the scoreboard in his  before Stuart Campbellwas run out by Woodruff. Saintfieldrsquos T McCavera picked up two wickets with CIYMSrsquo Steven Hughes and Woodruff also getting in on the act.The last wicket partnership of  between Neil Reillyand Keba Butlergot Dundrum closer than it looked as the NCU side ran out comfortable winners.The match ball sponsors were Bao and Bento and Pizza Palazzo, Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Downpatrick railway’s first afternoon tea event is runaway success  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway got out the best china when it hosted its very first afternoon tea event recently.The experience started with guests boarding the train at Downpatrick town station and taking a relaxing journey, travelling in a comfortable s carriage, to Inch Abbey by steam train.They then boarded the buffet carriage where guests were welcomed by the volunteers with a glass of prosecco, wine or a soft drink, before being directed to their allocated tables to enjoy a mouthwatering selection of freshly handmade sandwiches, luxury homemade scones with jam and cream and mini French patisseries.Guests were also offered bottomless teas and coffees, or their own pot of luxury specialist tea.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner, who was one of the servers, said: ldquoThis is something wersquove wanted to do for some time, and itrsquos always been a very popular treat on heritage railways in Great Britain.ldquoNerves may have been a bit jangled as with all first events.

If something does not happen soon we are finished, he said.ldquoTo be owed something like pound, by a public body like the Housing Executive is scandalous and someone should step in to sort this mess out.The crisis has been sparked off by staff shortages and industrial action in the accounts department of the Executive.A spokesman for the Executive said they were extremely concerned at the situation and had brought it to the attention of the Government.ldquoThere have been a number of vacancies in the department and we are unable to fill them because of the Government ban on recruitment to the public service. The result is that we cannot porocess these settlements as quickly as we normally do.He added: We are trying to do all we can to help the smaller contractors who are always much more vulnerable in such a situation.NEWCASTLE mdash A verdict of accidental death has been ed on Newcastle motorcycle ace Tom Herron, who died at the North West  earlier this year.Thirty year-old Herron, ranked third in the world, came off his bike at mph and smashed into a lamp post just  yards from the finishing line in the cc race. He died in hospital two hours later.The inquest at Coleraine heard how Herron had ridden in the race with an injury to his thumb and arm, but the pathologistrsquos report could not determine whether this would have interfered with his ability to control the bike at high speed.Two police constables, who witnessed the accident, told the inquest that the bike scraped the ground and the rider then lost control.The coroner, Mr Robin Wray, discounted suggestions to close the Portrush circuit and said that the racing gave a great deal of pleasure to a lot of people. He added that he had seen Herron race many times and always had a great admiration for him.DRUMANESS mdash Fresh hope for the old Drumaness Mill, which was becoming something of a white elephant, emerged this week with the news that Irish Waste Services have long term plans to develop it into an industrial estate.This week a spokesman for the company confirmed they had already moved on to the site. The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down.

A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

But when he arrived, to his dismay he found that the interview with the then taoiseach Jack Lynch had been turned into a press conference and he had largely wasted his time..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button It was Lynch who took the Republic into the EU on the same day as the UK joined in  – arguably Ireland’s single most transformative decision since partition.The outbreak of the Troubles meant that Lynch’s policy towards Northern Ireland defined much of his tenure, and although the current Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, only took up office two years ago and is only , Brexit is already almost certain to define his time in office.Leo Varadkar speaking to News Letter political editor Sam McBride in Belfast on TuesdayHis robust strategy of insisting that the UK commits to a backstop which treats Northern Ireland dferently to the rest of the UKBritain is to leave the customs union and single market now looks like it could have the unintended consequence of contributing to the UK leaving without any deal at all – a major economic threat to Ireland.Two weeks ago a poll found that a minority of the Irish publicback his Brexit strategy. The stakes are high not just for the Fine Gael leader, but for his nation.Sitting in the modern offices of the de facto Irish embassy in Belfast – the Irish Secretariat on Linenhall Street –Mr Varadkar has misgivings, he doesn’t show them.With relentless message discipline, he repeats the Irish government’s stance, insisting that it will not give up the backstop anda no-deal Brexit happens then it will be London’s choice.Mr Varadkar is a cautious interviewee, choosing words carefully and often appearing to say little beyond what has already been said. Even when asked when he first visited Northern Ireland , there is a sense that he is always thinking politically, delicately selecting his words.Did Northern Ireland at that time feel like an entirely dferent country or society “No. No. It definitely felt dferent, and is dferent, but certainly not foreign. I’ve always liked Belfast as a city and Queen’s in particular as a campus.”UFU: Brexit cull of , NI cattle is ‘scaremongering’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Again, when asked whether British-Irish relations are at their lowest point since the  Belfast Agreement – which seems obvious – he is coy, saying that relations between people in Britain and Ireland are “pretty good”, while “definitely Brexit has strained relations between the two governments ... and has created a very dficult environment for the parties in Northern Ireland”.But on Brexit there are subtle linguistic changes which hint at how the situation is changing. In January, he said that “even in a no-deal, there will not be ato a border”. Now, he implicitly accepts that no-deal will mean that there will be an economic border – although he hopes it can be enforced away from the border itself.However, he is clear that regardless of what happens – deal or no-deal, backstop or no backstop – the movement of people around the island will be unimpeded. Despite some people’s fears that no-deal would mean a border, impeding the movement of people crossing the border to shop, visit relatives or go to school, Mr Varadkar is clear that will not be the case.Highlighting how the UK and the Republic have given firm commitments to retain the common travel area, he says he is “confident” that will continue, along with access to each other’s labour markets, housing, education, welfare and pensions “as though we were citizens of both Britain and Ireland”.“We’ve agreed to keep that in place – so as long as the British and Irish governments commit to keep that in place, that will stay in place and our commitment to that is absolute and solid. I would hope that down the line the British government doesn’t decide that taking control of our borders means in any way diluting the common travel area – certainly we won’t.”His one caveat to that is that it is impossible to be certain of what “may happen down the line ... a lot of the reasons for the checks during the Troubles were security-related and I would certainly hope that the security situation would not deteriorate”.He stresses that violence at any future border is not inevitable “but I think we would be doing a disservice to our citizens north and southwe didn’t understand that it is a potential outcome”.Last week Arlene Foster – once Mr Varadkar’s opposite number as Stormont tourism minister and from whom he accepted an invitation to attend the Twelfth in Enniskillen seven years ago – accused him of being “very truculent” and refusing to engage in “sensible bilateral” discussions with the UK. She said he “hides behind the apron strings of the EU ... and he won’t speak to those of us who have a very big interest in finding a way forward”.When those comments are put to the taoiseach, he smiles, saying: “Yeah, I heard that and I’m conscious that it was Arlene Foster only last week who was advising me to dial down the rhetoric.“I don’t think in two years as taoiseach and in eight years in the Irish government I’ve ever made a pejorative comment about any unionist politician.”In a time of crisis in Northern Ireland  years ago, Jack Lynch’s solution was simple: “The reunication of the national territory can provide the only permanent solution for the problem.”Although Irish unity is more seriously talked about now than for many years, Mr Varadkar’s responses to questions around unity reveal a reluctance to rapidly move towards such a prospect.Asked whether the classic Irish nationalist idea of unity – an Irish unitary state – is a realistic or achievable prospect in the medium term, he said: “I would really not like to see the Brexit debate becoming a constitutional one. I fear thatyou have a no-deal hard Brexit, that that will arise and I don’t want that to happen ... I would really not like to see this issue of a united Ireland being brought to the fore as a consequence of a hard Brexit.“It’s the kind of thing that I always envisage,it ever would happen, it would happen in a more generational context and would give us time to talk about what that might look like because certainly for me it wouldn’t look like a unitary -county republic, the kind of thing that was envisaged by the founding fathers of the state, those that fought in the GPO – because that could never fully respect or embrace the million people here in the north who are British, who have a unique identity ... that was perhaps one of the flaws of the founding project of my state – that wasn’t properly respected at that time.”When askedhe envisaged the Irish and British governments staying neutral in a border poll or campaigning on either side of the debate, the taoiseach laughed and said: “That’s a good question, actually. I haven’t been asked that one before. I think long before we would ever have a border poll we would have to have a long and meaningful conversation as to what the question really is – we saw that with Brexit people voting on the issue of Brexit without perhaps a proper debate about what Brexit would look like or what Brexit would be.”Leo Varadkar, the gay son of immigrants at the head of a confident and technologically advanced Ireland, is a world away from Jack Lynch, the champion hurler at the helm of agrarian Catholic Ireland. But just as Northern Ireland unexpectedly imposed itself on his Fianna Fáil predecessor, so it is once more threatening to destabilise the southern state.try catch  TrendingN.I.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.

Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance. We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
