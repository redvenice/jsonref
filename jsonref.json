Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3907493.1559065706!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a day in the phoenix park it feels like the most peaceful place on earth","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin Zoo in the Phoenix Park. Photograph: James FordeThe sky is still a murky grey when there is a flash of yellow Lycra among the trees, the first sign of the early-morning runners who pound the pavements and grass of the Phoenix Park each day.The park’s famous deer are nowhere to be seen. Soon, Chesterfield Avenue, the spine of the park, yet again becomes a bustling throughway, with lorries squeezing through the main gate cars overtaking cyclists and cyclists overtaking electric scooters.More than 20 gardeners look after the park, arriving at 8am each day. Working here is no chore, says head gardener Meeda Downey: “Different things crop up. It doesn’t feel like you are coming to work at all.“The public are very appreciative too. They come up and tell you what a great job you’re doing. It puts you in a good mood,” she says, though she emphasises that where they can, they leave nature to its own devices to encourage bioersity.Shortly after 10am, the first busload of tourists pulls up in the park, for a welcome break from congested roads. Driver and tour guide Bill Dunne (50) slows, letting passengers take snaps of the Wellington Monument and “ooh” and “aah” at the deer.Dunne, who is from the Liberties, has been slowing down the Hop-On Hop-Off bus for Áras photos and the park’s other attractions for nearly 14 years, but he never tires of it.“Dublin is soaked in history, so it’s not too difficult bringing the ‘céad mile fáilte’ every day,” Dunnes says. His boisterous charm is appreciated by his passengers, who have started referring to him as the “leprechaun on steroids”.Americans are particularly keen on the park, surprised by the resemblance between Áras an Uachtaráin and the White House. Quickly setting them straight, Dunne says: “I tell them the White House resembles the Áras. Ours was built first, and that’s very important.”Three-year-old Lili Deleo, who lives in nearby Chapelizod, visits the park almost every day with her father, Niall Deleo (42), and their dog, Bob.“We just love it here,” says Niall. “She gets to see nature, the deer and play with other kids.” However, he worries that the Office of Public Works’ consultation threatens to “commercialise” the park. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” he believes, though he would prefer less traffic on Chesterfield Avenue.In Dublin Zoo, three-year-old Teddy McCann is restless with anticipation as he waits to see the “big gorilla”. He has been here many times before, says his grandmother, Diane Nelson, but the excitement never wanes.“We usually get him an annual pass for his birthday. He gets the monthly magazine so he gets very excited about coming to see the animals,” she says.Dublin hurler Conal Keaney (36), of Phoenix Park Bikes, has supplied bicycles to visitors for six years. Overseas people come in their droves, though Mr Keaney believes that many more Irish could take advantage of “the beauty on their doorstep”.Despite working long days, he remains in awe of the park: “No day is ever the same. We are meeting people from all over the world,” he says. “To be out here surrounded by squirrels and birds ... It’s a real privilege.”By evening the park has become home to the cricketers in the Phoenix Park Cricket Club, which has used a plot in the east of the grounds for 200 years – one that is the envy of many of their rivals, says Birmingham-born coach Stephen Moreton.“To have this as a place where kids of five or six can enjoy and stay on until they are 85 or 95 years old, as many of our members are, is just wonderful,” he says. “When you are here it feels like the most peaceful place on earth,” he says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3907457.1559063523!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"big plans for phoenix park doing nothing was not an option","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMax and Molly Rooney playing football in front of Áras an Uachtaráin in Phoenix Park. Photograph: James FordeVisitors to Dublin’s Phoenix Park had been happily motoring along – literally, for the most part – until suddenly they were hit with the news that the 360-year-old park, the largest enclosed park of any European capital city, was facing change.Change to beloved cultural institutions or amenities of any sort is generally deeply unpopular, but talk of funicular railways, driverless shuttles or “road trains” caught many park users like its famed deer in headlights.The Office of Public Works (OPW) is undertaking a strategic review of the visitor experience provided by the park, and such is the public interest, it extended the public consultation period, which had been due to end on April 26th, until Friday, May 31st.While the more ambitious projects, such as the repurposing of the Magazine Fort on Military Road as a visitor attraction – with the possible addition of the funicular railway, the construction of glowing “welcome pavilions” and the expansion of the Ashtown visitor centre – have attracted the most attention, the overarching principle is to improve facilities, OPW chief park superintendent Margaret Gormley says.“The 1,752 acres of the Phoenix Park are cherished by Dubliners and visitors alike, but in some ways it is a victim of its own successes. Some of its infrastructure is creaking at the seams, and the OPW came to the conclusion that to safeguard the park for the future the ‘do nothing’ scenario was not an option.”The OPW wants to redevelop the current Ashtown Demesne cafe as a children’s education centre and build a larger cafe and visitor centre, as well as allowing for extensive car-parking facilities.Magazine FortThe second major project would be the restoration of the Magazine Fort, built in 1736 to store gunpowder and ammunition for British army. The plan envisages exhibition facilities, a shop and cafe, a rampart walk and moat walk, with potential for a funicular railway to pull passengers up the steep hill from Chapelizod Road.“This has the potential to make a connection with the Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge at the point where a new bridge will be built across Liffey,” Gormley says, “but also to act as a hub for a historical military trail in this part of the city linking to the Grangegorman military cemetery and Arbour Hill.”The strategic review, drafted by Denis Byrne Architects for the OPW, makes proposals for five distinct areas of the park. In addition to the biggest projects at the Ashtown centre and the Magazine Fort, it proposes a “welcome quarter” at the Parkgate Street entrance, with twin pavilions acting as visitor information centres, which “may also glow in the evenings, as lanterns, to summon people, perhaps out of an autumn drizzle”.At the west end of the park, which takes in Furry Glen and the White Fields, a “bioersity quarter” with an interpretive centre could be developed, along with more toilets and an upgraded picnic area with a possible “organised” barbecue space. Barbecues, although a frequent occurrence – particularly on either side of the largely traffic-free Furze Road – are currently banned in the park.Finally, the strategy considers Chesterfield Avenue, the central traffic artery through the park. This could be dotted with playgrounds and temporary and permanent art installations and outdoor exhibitions, but what will probably attract most attention is the proposal for a “driverless shuttle” bus or “road train” carrying 15 passengers at a time. A train station on the underground Phoenix Park rail line that runs from Heuston Station could also be developed on the north side of Chesterfield Avenue, close to the zoo.Rewilding the parkThere has been some disquiet about the level of intervention proposed and concentration on tourist facilities in the review. The Green Party has called for a move away from construction in favour of “rewilding” the park, so it can remain a natural resource, particularly in a city that needs to promote more high-density living.However, architect Denis Byrne says this is a misconception of the nature, purpose and origins of the park.“The Phoenix Park is a very complex organism certain parts are wild, but certain parts are incredibly ornamental. There is a vast range of landscapes. It was originally a royal hunting park, so even its wilderness was a curated and carefully planned wilderness.”The review document represents “a bit of blue-sky thinking” rather than a “set of rules” for how the park must be developed, he says.In preparation for the review his firm studied how parks have developed in other cities, such as in London, Sydney and New York, while the idea of the funicular railway was inspired by Lisbon and the driverless shuttles are already in use in the Bois de Vincennes in Paris. However, Mr Byrne says, a mobility plan for the park could throw up other innovative ideas.“Who would have thought electric-powered scooters would suddenly be so popular –maybe they’ll be a way of getting around the park.”‘Soulless retail units’Local residents have raised concerns about the more commercial-heavy plans, with the Navan Road Community Council in particular opposing what it says will be “large, expensive, soulless retail units” at the Ashtown and Magazine Fort centres, which will require “an abundance of car-parking spaces”, it says. “Once areas of the park vanish under concrete they can never be returned.”The OPW shares the concerns about traffic in the park, Gormley says, and would like to develop more sustainable transport options such as the shuttle buses and, eventually, a station, but she says in the short to medium term, given the size of the park, and its use as a commuter route, traffic needs to be managed rather than eliminated.She stresses that the bioersity of the park will remain paramount. “There are no plans to change the ethos or the ambiance of the park, but you can retain those aspects and have good-quality toilets.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"A landmark experiment in 1919 set out to prove Einstein\u0026rsquos theory of relativity by observing a total eclipse.

Each year, Dubliners spend millions of hours inside its walls. It is the Phoenix Park, the largest enclosed public park in any European capital city. Once a Royal hunting park in the 17th century, Phoenix Park was open to the public in 1747. Today, it is home to the Zoological Gardens, Áras an Uachtaráin, and Victorian flower gardens. Fallow deer roam freely on grounds where they can trace their ancestors back hundreds of years, surrounded today by joggers, walkers and cyclists and the others who treasure it daily.Now, Dublin’s Phoenix Park is facing its most significant change in decades, with plans to attract more visitors and improve access. The OPW is proposing to create five districts in the park, each with their own focus and with a series of new additions, including a funicular, a driverless shuttle-bus, and a train station. And it wants your opinion by May 31st.Two “welcome pavilions” are proposed for the Parkgate Street entrance to welcome visitors that “may also glow in the evenings, as lanterns, to summon people, perhaps out of an autumn drizzle”, in the words of the OPW.The main visitor centre would be at the Ashtown Demesne, with the current cafe upgraded to children’s education centre. Extra facilities would be provided, including the possibility of extra car parking.The entrance to Dublin Zoo could be expanded, along with the nearby tea-rooms and band-stand. A train station on the underground Phoenix Park rail line which runs from Heuston Station could also be located to the east of the zoo. And the proposed changes go on.So what do you think?

Photograph:  Justin SullivanGetty ImagesMost Irish people today are aware that astronomy thrived in Ireland during the 19th century, thanks to the enthusiasm of a number of prominent wealthy amateurs, such as the famous Earl of Rosse.Since most of these astronomers were Anglo-Irish in background, the international profile of Irish astronomy declined sharply after independence. With this aura of a lost world of big houses and bigger telescopes goes an impression that the golden age of Irish astronomy left little imprint on the world of astronomy at large.It is not widely known that Irish astronomers played an essential role in the most famous astronomical experiment of the 20th century, which celebrates its centenary this year. That 1919 experiment involved two expeditions organised by leading English observatories which confirmed Einstein’s theory of General Relativity and made him a household name around the world almost overnight.Although the expeditions were launched from England, most of their instrumentation was manufactured in Ireland by an Irish firm. The most important data was taken by a telescope on loan to the expeditions from an Irish learned society, and it was operated in Brazil by an Irish astronomer. Thus Irish astronomy played a critical role in one of most famous scientific experiments ever conducted.Carte du CielIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Dublin was home to one of the world’s leading telescope manufacturers, the firm of Howard Grubb, originally founded by his father, Thomas Grubb, a Waterford-born Quaker. The project which helped Grubb make his name internationally was the first all-sky photographic survey, the Carte du Ciel project. Grubb manufactured seven “Astrographic” lenses for this project, for observatories around the world.He also made one with a very similar design for the Crawford Observatory in Cork, though it never participated in the Carte du Ciel. Because of their unique design intended for astrometry (the measurement of stellar positions) two of Grubb’s Astrographic lenses were used by the expeditions of 1919.Since eclipses played an important role in solar astronomy in the late 19th century, Grubb proposed an Irish expedition to observe the eclipse of 1900, visible in totality from parts of Spain and Portugal. The expedition was sponsored by the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society, with the participation of Dunsink Observatory.It was typical at this time for learned societies to provide funding for such expeditions, to purchase required equipment. For this expedition the RIA and the RDS each purchased a coelostat mirror from Grubb, who also provided a four-inch lens. Later the RIA lent the lens and its coelostat mirror to English Astronomer Fr Aloysius Cortie, a Jesuit priest, who used it at several subsequent eclipses.Gravitational fieldFr Cortie played an important role in planning for the eclipse of 1919, for which the English astronomer royal Sir Frank Watson Dyson proposed a novel observing programme. In 1915 Albert Einstein had published his general theory of relativity and one of its three main predictions was that light would be deflected from a straight path by the gravitational field of the Sun. Such a deflection would slightly shift the positions of stars next to the Sun, but such stars are only visible during a total solar eclipse.Dyson noted that the eclipse of 1919, visible in totality along a track across South America and Africa, would be especially suitable for testing Einstein’s theory, because the Sun would then be amongst the stars of the Hyades star cluster, the closest stellar cluster to the Earth.Unusually, there would be several bright stars close to the Sun during the eclipse. Although the planning of the expeditions was handicapped by the first World War, so auspicious was the eclipse star field for the testing of Einstein’s theory that Dyson and his main collaborator, Arthur Stanley Eddington of the Cambridge University Observatory, were determined to send observers if at all possible.When the war ended suddenly in late 1918 the eclipse teams were able to depart in March 1919, and Fr Cortie had arranged for the RIA’s equipment to accompany the expedition bound for Brazil. At the last minute he was denied permission by his order to go himself. Dyson chose as his replacement an Irish astronomer from his own staff at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Andrew Crommelin was an expert on the orbits of comets, best known for his accurate prediction of the time of comet Halley’s return in 1910.ConscriptionHe was available because he turned 51 in 1916, thus making him ineligible for conscription. Shortage of manpower was a major factor in planning for the expeditions of 1919. Both of Eddington’s assistants at the Cambridge Observatory had been killed in action during the war. Eddington himself, as a Quaker, had resisted conscription and might have been jailed but for Dyson’s intervention on his behalf.Crommelin was born in Cushendun, in the glens of Antrim in 1865. His family brought the linen industry to Ulster in the early 18th century. He observed the eclipse from Sobral, a small city in northeastern Brazil. The day of the eclipse, May 29th, was overcast but luckily a hole in the clouds appeared just before totality.During the eclipse, Crommelin operated the telescope loaned by the RIA. Since the other observers were foiled by equipment malfunctions and weather, it was the photographs taken by Crommelin which actually confirmed Einstein’s theory and overthrew Newton.Such is the significance of these results that Crommelin’s accidental involvement in the expedition of 1919 dwarfs his other scientific contributions. Einstein and Eddington’s fame has obscured the important contributions made by men like Dyson, Grubb and Crommelin. In this centenary year we should honour the Irish contribution to this famous scientific achievement.Daniel Kennefick’s book No Shadow of a Doubt –The 1919 Eclipse that Confirmed Einstein’s Theory of Relativity is published this week"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3908095.1559121423!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"solar eclipse experiment which proved einstein s theory had irish link","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Paul Callanan pictured with the equatorial telescope in the Crawford Observatory, UCC, which was manufactured by Howard Grubb.

Photograph: Andrew BradleyA total eclipse of the Sun 100 years ago today – on May 29th – provided the first evidence in favour of Einstein’s theory of general relativity.It gave humanity a new understanding of the Universe and Ireland played a critical but largely forgotten role, according to UCC physicist Prof Paul Callanan. A few years before 1919, Albert Einstein, had predicted how matter could bend the space around it, generating what we experience as gravity. “But Einstein’s predictions had to be tested, and it was decided to take pictures of the Sun during a solar eclipse, to see how the light from distant stars was affected as it passed as close as possible to the limb of the Sun,” he explained. So, two expeditions set off from England to obtain images of the Sun during the 1919 solar eclipse one to an island off the coast of Africa, and the other to a town called Sobral in Brazil. It turned out that the most accurate measurements were obtained in Sobral using Irish-made instruments, one of which was made by Howard Grubb (a foremost engineer of his time in the field of telescopes and photographic lenses). That expedition was led by astronomer Andrew Crommelin from Cushendun in Co Antrim. When the results were finally announced, they made the front page of the New York Times: “Lights all Askew in the Heavens, Einstein Theory Triumphs”– and it made Einstein a household name. “It was one of the defining moments in our understanding of how gravity really works,” Prof Callanan said. Einstein would later remark the “expedition of 1919 is ultimately to blame for this whole misery, by which the general masses seized possession of me.”Rarely in any area of science have Irish-made instruments played such a key role in a fundamental discovery, Prof Callanan noted. “We should always be proud of that. It’s great tribute to Grubb and Crommelin.”Grubb in particular had a reputation as “a genius who meant business” – the view of astronomer, mathematician and polymath Simon Newcomb. From his works in Rathmines, he made hundreds of telescopes for leading observatories around the world, including instruments at the Crawford Observatory in UCC. The original device used for the key measurement still exists today in Dunsink Observatory.Prof Callanan said he regards him as one of the earliest examples of “a high tech entrepreneur” in Ireland. Moreover, he believed there was insufficient appreciation of Ireland’s contribution of science and development going back hundreds of years. As a consequence, there was an onus on scientists and technologists today to maintain and build on that reputation.Recently the world saw the first image of a Black Hole in space, he pointed out. “The press release concerning the Event Horizon Telescope image of the black hole last month also mentions this year being the 100th anniversary of a famous astronomical event that occurred in 1919. The image is very much part of the same journey – but in this case testing a theory for the space around an object a thousand million times more massive than our own Sun.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3908067.1559117810!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk labour in i am spartacus moment over alastair campbell expulsion","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlastair Campbell speaks to the media outside his home in north London on Tuesday after he was expelled from the Labour Party for  voting for the Liberal Democrats in the European elections. Photograph:  Dominic LipinskiPA Wire Alastair Campbell has claimed senior figures in Jeremy Corbyn’s office recommended voting against Labour as support for his decision to shun the party in the European elections grew.Tony Blair’s former spin doctor, a leading campaigner for a second referendum, was ousted from the Labour Party after he backed the Liberal Democrats at the polls.On Tuesday night Mr Campbell said members of Mr Corbyn’s staff were among those who sent “many, many messages of support” for his decision.Hours earlier Charles Clarke, the former Labour home secretary and party chairman, said he also voted Liberal Democrat in the election, while ex-defence secretary Bob Ainsworth said he voted Green, in developments being described as an “I am Spartacus” moment for the party.Speaking outside his north London home, Mr Campbell said he would appeal the expulsion and warned Labour faced “oblivion” unless it clarified its Brexit position. “I think that there are people in Jeremy Corbyn’s office, senior positions in Jeremy Corbyn’s office, who have recommended voting against the Labour Party,” he said. “You can interpret the rules in all sorts of different ways, but one thing I know is I’m not going to leave the party just because some random email comes in telling me that I’ve been expelled.”In a tweet he added: “Among many, many messages of support have been some from Corbyn’s office, shadow cabinet, MPs, union leaders and party staff including one telling me there is a mountain of emails from members who responded to mobilisation email by saying no to campaigning and not voting Labour.”He said it “remains to be seen” whether other members who admitted opting against Labour at the polls would also be expelled.Mr Campbell described his rapid expulsion as “strange” and said “people will inevitably draw the contrast with the lack of rapidity in dealing with cases involving anti-Semitism”.Labour said “support for another political party or candidate is incompatible with party membership” but declined to say whether Mr Clarke would also be ousted.Election drubbingIn a statement, Mr Clarke said Labour “should immediately withdraw its expulsion of Alastair”. The former party chairman, a Labour member for 47 years, added: “I was not aware that Alastair had voted Liberal Democrat in the European election until I heard him say so on television on Sunday evening.“His expulsion from Labour Party membership is a disgrace and only compounds Labour’s current political difficulties. I also voted Liberal Democrat. This was a one-off decision because of the hopeless incoherence of Labour’s position, particularly that of Jeremy Corbyn, on Brexit.” Mr Ainsworth – the defence secretary in Gordon Brown’s government – told BBC Coventry \u0026amp Warwickshire: “Having recently voted Labour in local elections, I voted Green in the Euro elections having never voted other than Labour before in my entire life.“I didn’t intend to make this public, but now Alastair has been expelled for doing the same I feel obliged to do so.”Labour and the Conservatives received a drubbing in the European elections as Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party romped to victory and the Liberal Democrats took the second largest share of the vote.Mr Campbell said Mr Blair, who was Labour prime minister between 1997 and 2007, refused during his tenure to withdraw the Labour whip from Mr Corbyn when he rebelled.“Tony was of the view, no, you’ve got to have dissenting voices around,” he said. He said he was “still in the Labour Party” and would “always be Labour”.Mr Campbell, a key player in the New Labour era, declined to rule out shunning the party again in a snap general election and said it would “depend” on its Brexit policy.Labour rules say members who support a party other than Labour are automatically ineligible for membership. Mr Campbell’s expulsion was also described as an “absurd act of political self-harm” by former Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay, who announced he had joined the Liberal Democrats on Tuesday morning. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeBrexit latest news: Matt Hancock becomes latest leadership candidate to rule out no-deal as he takes swipe at Boris JohnsonAustralia\u0026#39s \u0026#39Egg Boy\u0026#39 gives donations to survivors of New Zealand mass shootingComment: Is Rory Stewart the real deal or Gove\u0026#39s Manchurian Candidate?

Amnesty has also accused the AA of abducting civilians and endangering them with its operations. The abuses are continuing despite global outrage at the brutal military operation in August 2017 that prompted some 730,000 Rohingya to flee and take shelter in destitute refugee camps in neighbouring Bangladesh.  United Nations investigators said that the army’s campaign of murder, mass rape and arson had been conducted with “genocidal intent.”Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh are destitute and overflowing “The new operations in Rakhine State show an unrepentant, unreformed and unaccountable military terrorising civilians and committing widespread violations as a deliberate tactic,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty’s Regional Director for East and Southeast Asia.The new evidence shows that multiple communities have borne the brunt of the latest onslaught. Amnesty conducted 81 interviews, including 54 on the ground in Rakhine state with ethnic Rakhine, Mro, Rohingya and Khami villagers, belonging to the Buddhist, Christian and Muslim faiths. The investigation, which also included satellite imagery, recorded seven unlawful attacks that killed 14 civilians and injured at least 29 more. In one incident, a seven-year-old boy, reportedly severely injured by a military mortar, died after being denied immediate medical care by soldiers. In mid-March, another army mortar exploded in Ywar Haung Taw village, injuring four and destroying a house. “I heard an explosion. It was very loud and there was a big fireball that fell around us,” said the homeowner, Hla Shwe Maung. Amnesty reports that the deployment of units from the 22nd and 55th Light Infantry Divisions suggests the operation has been sanctioned from the highest levels. The military has not issued a response. The AA has denied endangering civilians. Amnesty has called on the UN Security Council to urgently refer the situation in Burma to the International Criminal Court and impose a comprehensive arms embargo. Laura Haigh, the group’s Myanmar researcher, said the UNSC had “completely abdicated in their responsibility” to do so. “If anything, there is even less momentum than there was before. What is happening now is the perfect example of why they do need to take action because clearly the inaction to date has allowed more abuses to be committed,” she said.  Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Matt Hancock becomes latest leadership candidate to rule out no-deal as he takes swipe at Boris JohnsonAustralia\u0026#39s \u0026#39Egg Boy\u0026#39 gives donations to survivors of New Zealand mass shootingComment: Is Rory Stewart the real deal or Gove\u0026#39s Manchurian Candidate?

The Prime Minister came under pressure on the issue after it was felt that the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s pledge to abolish tuition fees won support from young voters in the last general election.  Ministers have previously criticised universities for running “threadbare” courses in a rush to get “bums on seats”.The Education Secretary recently criticised the proliferation of “low value, low quality” courses which churn out graduates who go into poorly paid jobs and are unable to pay back their student loans.The study by Onward found that men who have taken degrees in Creative Arts, Communications, English, Agriculture, Psychology, Philosophy and Languages at some universities will earn less than the national living wage, on average, five years after their graduation.Male students studying Creative Arts from Bolton University earn an average of £14,400 five years after graduation, which is lower than the full-time national living wage.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, has said that it is “irresponsible” to discourage people from studying at university when there are “such clear benefits” for graduates, business and public services.“Students are right to expect value for money and universities are striving to deliver this and address any concerns,” he said.  “However, salary outcomes shouldn’t be the only measure of value. Many graduates work in vital roles in the public and charitable sectors or creative industries that make hugely valuable contributions to society and enrich our lives.”Department for EducationPlease review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Matt Hancock becomes latest leadership candidate to rule out no-deal as he takes swipe at Boris JohnsonAustralia\u0026#39s \u0026#39Egg Boy\u0026#39 gives donations to survivors of New Zealand mass shootingComment: Is Rory Stewart the real deal or Gove\u0026#39s Manchurian Candidate?

Almost 95 per cent of Indonesia\u0026#39s police and military is made up of men“In interactions with the Indonesian government, be it trade, the Department for International Development or any other context, the UK should strenuously advocate for the removal of the test. It can put conditionalities on aid and trade that should require the removal of virginity testing,” she said. Just last week, Indonesia deployed thousands of police and military officers to the streets of the capital, Jakarta, to quell violent protests over disputed presidential election results. The absence of female officers was stark. Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), who has researched the issue for decades, claimed the practice was impacting the military’s performance at home and abroad.Last June, Indonesia was selected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and has since faced calls to improve its poor record on female participation in peacekeeping missions.But last week the Indonesian defence ministry continued to defend the continued use of “virginity tests” when recruiting female officers as a question of “character”.Iroth Sonny Edhie, a chief aide and head of protocol for the Indonesian defence minister, told The  that virginity tests were a central aspect of recruitment.  Firecrackers explode amid violent riots following the Indonesian presidential elections“Basically this value has been preserved since our armed forces was established around 70 years ago.”But pressure has been mounting internationally to abandon virginity tests, with the World Health Organisation and the United Nations calling for a total ban to the practice last October.The agencies said that although the tests are prevalent in at least 20 countries around the globe, including Afghanistan, Egypt and Iraq, there is “no evidence” that “the female genitalia can indicate a girl’s or woman’s history of sexual activity.”Fears are growing about the influence of conservative Islam on the largely moderate society of Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim nation.HRW first exposed the use of virginity tests by security forces in 2014. Little has changed since – the army, navy and air force still openly subject women to the invasive practice.Human rights activists say women play a unique role in peace-keepingMr Harsono told The  that groups of three to five women go into a hospital room together and are subjected to the test in quick succession. The medic, often a man, inserts two fingers into a woman’s vagina to see if the hymen is intact. “It\u0027s not about the pain, but the trauma of being exposed,” he said. “Most doctors are male, and women are asked to lie down with their legs open. It\u0027s the associated trauma – having to undress completely in front of others, that stays with the women.”“This is unscientific, this is irrational, this is discriminatory against women, this is degrading,” Mr Harsono added.Academic, physical and personality assessments are all part of the military application process. While some reports suggest there are often no repercussions of “failing” the virginity test, it is one of a series of personality assessments used to determine if a woman is “good enough.”“The skill to shoot, the skill to defend your country, is nothing to do with your virginity,” Eva Sunduri, an MP in Indonesia’s parliament since 2004, told The .Indonesia post-election protests leave six dead in JakartaThe Indonesian police appear to have recognised there is a problem. “Since 2014, we didn’t do it for a requirement of the police test. To be a policewoman does not depend on virginity,” said Brigadier General Dedi Praseyto, the national police spokesman.However, Mr Harsono alleged that while the practice had ended in the capital Jakarta, it was still taking place in provinces that were “very difficult to control.”The small percentage of female police officers is a challenge in a country which struggles to tackle sexual violence – in 2013 more rapes were reported among Sweden’s 10 million citizens than in Indonesia, which has a population of 250 million, suggesting that many survivors fear reporting the crime.“Women often do not want to report these crimes against them to male officers.”Mrs Budi claimed the police continued virginity tests under the guise of a “reproductive health check.”“The police say that they have stopped virginity tests, but I’m not so sure. The police now say that women need to have a reproductive health check… but I have been told this test still includes a virginity test.”Studies have shown that women can help to calm violent situationsShe added: “I feel sad and disappointed about the practice, yes, because of the assumption that a woman has to be a virgin to be a good woman. This leads to unfair judgments of women.”Sri Rumiati, a retired officer, has been campaigning for an end to the tests in the police force since she realised in 2006 that they only applied to women. When she joined the Indonesian National Police in 1985, she did not question the practice.“At the beginning of undergoing a virginity test, of course it was not comfortable for me, because I had to open the private domain before a doctor,” she told The . “Sad, upset but unable to do anything because this is part of the selection, I just lived with it.”She now maintains that the tests are against Indonesian anti-discimination laws, but has faced opposition from male colleagues.“Many were angry when I questioned the requirements for virginity checks, especially from the health ision that made these requirements,” she said. “There were some people who said I was crazy.”  Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleHowever, not everyone who has been subjected to the test is against it. Many female officers see it as a rite of passage, as a test which helps to maintain a quality police force.“Virginity testing is part of the reason that we don’t have many female police officers,” Anindya Restuviani, co-director of campaign group Hollaback! Jakarta, told The .“But it’s complicated, lots of women who are in the police or army think that virginity tests are good. And there’s a mindset that they are superior because they passed the test,” she said.“Virginity testing is just another form of the discrimination women face every day,” she added. “There are many, many reasons it happens but the main problem is the patriarchal culture. Women are perceived as second class citizens, they’re not seen as having the same value as men.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Department for International DevelopmentBrexit latest news: Matt Hancock becomes latest leadership candidate to rule out no-deal as he takes swipe at Boris JohnsonAustralia\u0026#39s \u0026#39Egg Boy\u0026#39 gives donations to survivors of New Zealand mass shootingComment: Is Rory Stewart the real deal or Gove\u0026#39s Manchurian Candidate?

One person was killed and at least 130 were injured.The storms in Kansas City on Tuesday were the 12th straight day that at least eight tornadoes were reported to the National Weather Service.After several quiet years, the past couple of weeks have seen an explosion of tornado activity with no end to the pattern in sight. The previous 11-day stretch of at least eight tornadoes per day ended on June 7, 1980.We\u0027re getting big counts on a lot of these days and that is certainly unusual, Patrick Marsh, warning coordination meteorologist for the federal Storm Prediction Centre, said.The National Weather Service had already received at least 27 more reports of tornadoes on Tuesday, suggesting that the record for consecutive days would be broken once the official totals are in.A large and dangerous tornado touched down on the western edge of Kansas City, Kansas, late on Tuesday, the National Weather Service office reported. At least a dozen people were admitted to the hospital in Lawrence, 40 miles west of downtown Kansas City, Missouri, and home to the University of Kansas, hospital spokesman Janice Early said. Damage also was reported in the towns of Bonner Springs, Linwood and Pleasant Grove in Kansas.But the Kansas City metropolitan area of about 2.1 million people appeared to have been spared the direct hit that was feared earlier in the evening when the weather service announced a tornado emergency.Mark Duffin, 48, learned from his wife and a television report that the large tornado was headed toward his home in Linwood, about 30 miles west of Kansas City.The next thing he knew, the walls of his house were coming down.Mr Duffin told the Kansas City Star that he grabbed a mattress, followed his 13-year-old to the basement and protected the two of them with the mattress as the home crashed down around them.I’m just glad I found my two dogs alive, he said. Wife’s alive, family’s alive, I’m alive. So, that’s it.The severe weather wasn’t limited to the Midwest. Tornadoes were confirmed in eastern Pennsylvania and the National Weather Service issued a tornado warning for parts of New York City and northern New Jersey.The winds peeled away roofs - leaving homes looking like giant dollhouses - knocked houses off their foundations, toppled trees, brought down power lines and churned up so much debris that it was visible on radar. Highway crews had to use snowplows to clear an Ohio interstate.People look on as they examine the damaged remains of school in Dayton, OhioSome of the heaviest damage was reported just outside Dayton, Ohio.I just got down on all fours and covered my head with my hands, said Francis Dutmers, who with his wife headed for the basement of their home in Vandalia, about 10 miles outside Dayton, when the storm hit with a very loud roar on Monday night. The winds blew out windows around his house, filled rooms with debris and took down most of his trees.Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine declared a state of emergency in three hard-hit counties, allowing the state to suspend normal purchasing procedures and quickly provide supplies like water and generators.Outbreaks of 50 or more tornadoes are not uncommon, having happened 63 times in US history, with three instances of more than 100 twisters, Mr Marsh said. But Monday’s swarm was unusual because it happened over a particularly wide geographic area and came amid an especially active stretch, he said.An aerial photo shows damaged homes and debris marking the path of a tornado in CelinaAs for why it’s happening, Mr Marsh said high pressure over the Southeast and an unusually cold trough over the Rockies are forcing warm, moist air into the central US, triggering repeated severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. And neither system is showing signs of moving, he said.Scientists say climate change is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme weather such as storms, droughts, floods and fires, but without extensive study they cannot directly link a single weather event to the changing climate.Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

A shortened pre-season as his arrival dragged on throughout the summer, Sarri hit the ground running, attempted to change a decade-long style and, eventually, provided invaluable minutes to academy graduates Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ruben Loftus-Cheek - something the fanbase has craved for years. His stubbornness and lack of variety frustrated many, but eventually he adjusted, pushing City mightily close in the League Cup final and leading the Blues to third and the Europa League final. A satisfactory debut season under difficult circumstancesHe arrived with the enormous weight and expectation from his price tag as the world\u0027s most expensive goalkeeper. Yet Kepa settled quickly, making very few mistakes and proving quietly productive with his feet. The incident at Wembley to not accept Maurizio Sarri\u0027s substitution vs Man City was regretful, yet he bounced back and was pivotal in ensuring the Blues won the shoot-out vs Frankfurt to reach the Europa League final. Still a long way to go to justify the price tag and prove Chelsea have a long-term solution, but he\u0027s made a decent startHandled the Kepa fiasco maturely and proved reliable when he stepped in, five clean sheets in eight appearances - about as solid as you can find as a No 2 without the realistic ambition to surpass the No 1No first team appearances, but seemingly slotted in to his role and proved likable in the dressing room. A send-off in Boston in the friendly vs New England Revolution was deservedEmerging as one of the top five centre-backs in the Premier League with little fanfare. Excellent at recovering, efficient with the ball and even able to stroll out from the back, a cornerstone for Chelsea moving forward. Cruelly deniedA season of regression with his place now under serious threat despite signing a new five-year deal. Productive nonetheless with four goals and seven assists, but a liability at times when defending Has impressed Sarri enough to nudge Alonso out of the starting line-up at times, but is yet to fully lock down a starting role.  Has at least proven to be decent competition and coverHas shown signs of decline but still a favourite under Sarri. Starting to show defensive fragility for almost the first time in his Chelsea career and when the side became predictable, his lack of penetration going forward became evidentHas been an option late in games when Chelsea are chasing and can cross well from deep areas, but will surely be moved on this summer with Reece James andor Ola Aina natural squad optionsHas been frustrated at his lack of starts behind Luiz and Rudiger. Has filled in well to an extent when called upon though, but lacked consistencyHas been Sarri\u0027s mind on the pitch and key to the style transition. Very few defenders better with the ball at their feet and for that reason his extension has proven shrewd. Occasional lack of concentration, but that will not change at this stage of his career. One of the few leaders left at Chelsea and was pivotal in stopping this side fully unravel at timesHarshly treated by Sarri, but not a fit for the way he wanted to play, will be fondly remembered after winning everything with the Blues and eventually received the send-off he deservedStarted brilliantly to inspire a new style at the Bridge. But has been treated ridiculously by some Chelsea fans, who have bizarrely booed him at times this season. Responded well in the last few months and appears to have now settled, will play a vital role in the outcome in BakuEmbraced his new, more adventurous role to the right of Jorginho. Added craft to his game and his energy was critical to Sarriball showing promising signs in year one. Injury is a concern ahead of Baku, but he seems set to recover in timeHas not shone much, but always reliable in possession. Just lacks that cutting edge in the final third and has almost no production in terms of goals and assists despite the freedom of his role. Sarri remains a fan and they will try to sign him permanentlyThe Blues youngster was part of the first team squad throughout the season and impressed in the Europa League: brave on the ball and demonstrating excellent positioning - hasn\u0027t played since suffering a back injury in FebruaryFlourished in the second half of the season to show real signs he can blossom into one of the game\u0027s best box-to-box midfielders, scoring 10 goals in the process. Cruelly injured before the Europa League final and will be out for many months with an Achilles injuryScored the late equaliser vs United and won his England place back, but rarely felt like a \u0027starter\u0027, doing little to justify leaving out Loftus-Cheek and Kovacic for long spells. Will need to step it up next season or he will likely be moved onScored 12 goals and made five assists. His strikes against Tottenham and Frankfurt proved especially important and with Gonzalo Higuain and Olivier Giroud blunting the Blues\u0027 attack, he has emerged as probably the best finisher in this squad, supporting the burden on Eden HazardHas not settled at all, looking slow and offering little outside his movement inside the area, he looks set to return to Turin this summer, even if the transfer ban is heldUnable to convince Sarri he was worth a permanent role to spearhead the side\u0027s attack, yet always proving useful when called upon, especially so in the Europa League, where he became the top scorer in the competition with 10 goals alongside Luka Jovic - deserved a longer run in the side in the leagueSuffered a woeful spell of form and loss of confidence and eventually accepted a move to Atletico in January. Ends his Chelsea career with 24 goals in 72 appearancesHe had to show great patience before a sustained run in the side came, but he justified the hype and showed himself to be worth of starts ahead of Pedro and Willian at times. Quick feet and a refreshing willingness to go on the outside and cross the ball - which would have helped Higuain and Giroud in the closing stages of the season. Will be forced to show more mental resolve to come back from an Achilles injury next season, with his future yet to be clarified entering the final year of his contractA frustrating presence in the side during Chelsea\u0027s predictable spell when sides began to work out Sarriball and also blocked Hudson-Odoi\u0027s opportunities at times. Still provides hard work and neat in possession, but rarely able to provide a cutting edge. Another player with an uncertain future and only one year remaining on his contractOutstanding at times and back to the form to suggest he is the best player in the Premier League, has done enough to earn his move to Real Madrid and will be sorely missed. Without him and his 19 goals and 16 assists, Chelsea would have surely fallen short of top four and been unable to compete with Man City in two of their three meetingsHow did Chelsea\u0027s players perform this season?

I felt there was so much more we could do.Created with Sketch.Marvel films – ranked worst to best Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.15. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.14. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the Wasp13. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.22. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.21. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.20. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of Ultron19. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.18. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.17. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 216. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond.

Oh, you watched the film, therefore you should have a say over where it goes?’ I thought it was very unfortunate and kind of disappointing.”The actor will next be seen in Men In Black International, which he stars in alongside his Avengers co-star Tessa Thompson. it’ll be released in cinemas on 14 June.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

David Barnett reports\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentJoy Division: (left to right) Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Peter HookIt’s a big year for fans of Joy Division and New Order. This summer marks 40 years since the former’s debut album Unknown Pleasures, their only LP released before the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis, aged 23, in May 1980. The surviving members – bassist Hook, guitarist Bernard “Barney” Sumner and drummer Stephen Morris – transformed themselves into New Order that year, joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards, with Sumner taking over vocals. It’s 30 years since the band released Technique. It was their their fifth album, but the one that propelled them to the top of the charts and into proper stardom, influenced by the Balearic sound of house music.Everybody, it seems, has a Joy Division or New Order story to tell, as evidenced by the books released this year. Jon Savage’s This Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else is an “oral history” of Joy Division, published by Faber in April. Drummer Stephen Morris has his memoirs, Record Play Pause, out this month. Dave Haslam, one-time DJ at Manchester’s Hacienda club, the focal point of the so-called Madchester scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, mentions his love of both bands in his recent autobiography, Sonic Youth Slept On My Floor.“Hooky”, you might be unsurprised to hear, doesn’t have a lot of truck with any of them. We meet in a Costa in Alderley Edge, a leafy little town in Cheshire, only 20 miles away, geographically, from Salford, where Hooky and Bernard Sumner grew up, but half a world away in other respects.He’s lived here for 20 years, and as we find a quiet corner of the coffee shop, I mention in passing that I took my 14-year-old daughter to listen to Haslam reading from his book a few weeks ago. “Well, when she grows up she’ll never forgive you,” he says.Created with Sketch.Caught on film: Joy Division on tour in 1979 Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hooky perhaps has a reputation for abrasiveness, for speaking his mind, for not taking any crap. He and New Order parted ways in 2007 and don’t appear to be on good terms. I mention that Haslam had spoken fondly of him, which he finds hard to believe. Has he read Haslam’s book?“I haven’t read many good Manchester books,” he says. “I think my favourite is Bez’s. I’ve got Mark E Smith’s on my shelf but not got round to it yet.”Peter Hook to perform Joy Division albums in full at UK showsJoy Division’s Bernard Sumner’s memoir recalls the death of bandmateHooky himself wrote Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division, published in 2012, and he says he did so as a direct response to the author and journalist Mick Middles’ 1996 book, From Joy Division to New Order. “That Middles book was a crock of f**king shit but he inspired me to write my own,” he says. “I suppose I’m in the unenviable position of being too close to the whole thing.”I wave Jon Savage’s book at him and he shakes his head. “That is particularly annoying that one, it’s Joy Division in their own words but a lot of it’s just lifted from when we did the Joy Division documentary. Those interviews were from the Control interview, Faber bought them lock stock and barrel without our permission, without even a f**king charity donation. He had access to the whole transcripts. Didn’t make sense to me, especially from Jon Savage who you’ve known for 40 f**king years. We weren’t party to how it was done in any way shape or form so it’s just another annoyance.”Does a lot of stuff annoy Peter Hook generally? He shrugs. “It’s not that bad after a while. You just get used to it. You get to that bit where nothing surprises you. I mean, I’ve had a few fracas with Jon because he sided with them lot and excluded me which I felt was really unfair, especially when I used to tow his f**king car back so our kid could fix it. So yeah… people have short memories.”There’s a chapter in Dave Haslam’s book where he details being commissioned by NME to interview New Order, a band of which he describes himself as “a devotee, bewitched by them”. Haslam interviewed the band in 1986 at their recording studio in Cheetham Hill afterwards, Hooky gave him a lift back into Manchester city centre. Haslam had taped the interview but something went wrong his tape was blank. In a panic, he sat down in a cafe and tried to write down everything again from memory, commenting:\u0026nbsp“No one knew how I’d crafted the quotes by New Order.”Tales grow in the telling. Legends get embellished. Stories take on a life of their own. “Yeah,” concedes Hooky. In 2010 he wrote a book called The Hacienda: How Not to Run a Club, and says he initially wanted to do it on interviews with the principal characters. “What I found which was really weird, when I started talking to a few people I very quickly realised that everybody had a different memory of the single occasion, so I thought f**k this, I’m going to have to do it on my own. And you find even though you think something is true you can be contradicted by people.”As an example, Hooky cites his auctioning off earlier this year of all his old Joy Division and New Order memorabilia, to raise money for the Epilepsy Society (Ian Curtis suffered from it) and Calm, the charity aimed at tackling suicide, especially among men. He put a bell tree percussion device in the lots, saying it had been used on the Joy Division track Atmosphere. Drummer Stephen Morris, who would have used it, disputed the fact.Hooky says, “I think you’d have to be deaf not to realise that a bell tree made the sound and it wasn’t a tambourine stuck on a pair of scissors. But that is an example of how people can remember completely different things. Normally it doesn’t lead to that level of aggro but it is quite shocking really because there is no truth, the only truth really is your truth. You’re not gonna lie. I’m sure Stephen Morris thinks it was but, y’know, in my opinion he’s wrong, and you have to go with your own truth otherwise you’d never get through life. It is interesting the way you can have completely different ideas.”V97 with Monaco (PA)There’s a sense when talking to Peter Hook that his often cutting remarks about the people he’s shared some of the last 40-odd years with are, in a way, a defensive tactic, that there’s been so many wars of words since New Order split that he’s getting his jabs in first. At one point I ask him what would happen if Bernard Sumner walked into the Costa we were sitting in, and he laughs uproariously and says, “You’d need your camera, mate!”But it’s obvious he loves the music. He’s rarely been without a band or project since he started while New Order were still going he worked with another Factory band, Ad Infinitum. When New Order had their first break-up in 1993, he started two new bands, Revenge and Monaco. New Order reformed for almost a decade from 1998, during which time Hooky began to develop his DJing career, which now sees him about to embark on a tour with Hacienda Classical, kicking off on 8 June at Scarborough’s Open Air Theatre.Classical accompaniment to pop and dance music is something of a thing right now, but this is the fifth year of the Hacienda Classical concept, which combines the live orchestral music of the Manchester Camerata with DJs recreating the sounds of the nightclub’s heyday. If you think that sounds a bit weird, then you wouldn’t be on your own.Camerata Orchestra performing Hacienda Classical (Rex)The idea had been pioneered by DJ Todd Terry in the States, and British DJ Pete Tong had started doing it over here. “Pete Tong was doing it more as a concert, songs finishing and starting. Graeme’s idea was to do it as a DJ mix, just the same as it would be in a club, so once you started you didn’t stop,” says Hooky.That caused some problems with some venues because they wanted an intermission in which to make up the takings on the bar. “But we felt it was more intrinsic to the spirit of the Hacienda to be complete it starts and it finishes, you’re f**ked and you go home and you recover. It was that depth of feeling that you wanted from what we were doing.”The orchestra plays live and the sound is mixed by the DJ in to the classic Hacienda club tracks, with live vocalists. Hooky gets a bit of fire in his eyes that’s impossible to fake just for PR purposes as he waxes lyrical over the gigs. “A lot of these songs you’ve grown up with and they’ve marked many, many special occasions in your life… death, kids, meeting the missus, losing the missus … it’s very charged, it’s very physical, and people f**king love it. And it gives all us old people the excuse to live our youth again, get a babysitter, have the kids tucked up at home, and fearing what you’re going to feel like the next morning.”Hooky started DJing in 2004, doing it full time in 2007 when New Order split for the second time. He says, “I started doing it out of necessity because I had no money at that point, as New Order we’d not worked for a bit. I mainly do dance music and I get in a lot of trouble because everybody expects you to play the f**king Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays ad infinitum.Madchester’ hub\u0026nbsp(Rex)“The other fantastic thing is most DJs are sober and they’re always on time, which is f**king fantastic. If I’m on at 9 o’clock I know the DJ before me will finish at 8.59.59. You play with groups and they’re always f**king late, nobody arguing about who goes on last and all that crap. It’s very courteous. The rivalry comes with you wanting to play a better set.”So he’s looking forward to hitting the road with the Hacienda Classical Tour, which takes in the Royal Albert Hall and the Isle of Wight Festival among its dates. But Hooky has a special soft spot for the tour opener, Scarborough.“Scarborough is a great place,” he enthuses. “I DJ’d in that old place on the pier the last time I was there. They were nuts. And I never realised how beautiful Scarborough was. Scarborough actually reminded me insanely of Palma, Majorca. I couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. All that European money, innit? And they won’t be getting that any more.”Ah, here it is. We look at each other cautiously over our coffee cups. Ageing rock stars and Brexit. You never know how that one’s going to pan out, do you? Morrissey calling the referendum result “magnificent” and Johnny Rotten in a “make America great again” T-shirt.“Look,” says Hooky, who lives in Majorca for half the year and has ambitions to do that full-time. “I’m a traveller. I go all round the world all the time and I do think it’s important in this day and age for us all to stick together, and not to be fragmented. I think that’s the worst thing that could happen to anybody and I think it exacerbates differences and things like immigration and racism.“I just think it’s the wrong way of pursuing a modern life. It’s old-fashioned, and honestly if you found someone who still thought it was a good idea then they’re a f**king idiot because it’s been proved that our government can’t handle it, which is an embarrassment. I was sat there last week doing a Euro news interview and the guy’s going, ‘What’s happening with Brexit?’ and I haven’t a f**king clue but there’s one thing I do know that if I was doing my job as shit as them I’d be stood on me own in a concert hall. There’d be no audience, right, and that’s what makes me laugh about it. Our government is selfish, it’s only interested in power, personal power, personal politics, and the country is just an absolute f**king embarrassment.”He pauses, then shakes his head and adds, “David Cameron should be torn apart by an angry mob. Theresa May had\u0026nbspthe balls to try to stay in office and say I’ll see it out, not like that shithouse.”Though DJing with the Hacienda Classical tour will dominate this summer, Hooky does of course still keep his bass arm working, primarily with Peter Hook and The Light. That started in 2010, around the 30th anniversaryof Ian Curtis’s death, the same year he opened a new nightclub, The Factory, in the old\u0026nbspoffices of Factory Records\u0026nbspin Manchester. The Light performs Joy Division and New Order tracks, as they were meant to be heard, faithfully following the order of the songs on the albums.“I literally only booked one gig, which was at The Factory, and it was supposed to be a one-off celebration and we ended up doing two nights and we started getting loads of interest,” he recalls. “We hadn’t booked anything until we played, it all came out as a result of that and it was wonderful. I’d not played Joy Division songs for 30 years ... to actually start playing them was absolutely fantastic because we hardly ever did them as New Order.”According to Hooky, New Order “buried Joy Division along with Ian”, and they would only very occasionally revisit the old stuff, such as when manager Rob Gretton asked them to play Love Will Tear Us Apart “because it’s f**king so-and-so’s birthday”. He says, “I think we played in our whole career of New Order about three Joy Division songs.”That changed in 2006 when New Order played the first Manchester Versus Cancer gig, an initiative set up by Andy Rourke of The Smiths. They played a full set of Joy Division tunes. “It was absolutely fantastic, it was delightful, absolutely delightful to do,” says Hooky. “But I don’t think Barney liked doing it and I understand that. He wanted to do his own lyrics, he wanted to do his own songs, which makes perfect sense. But it was a frustration, because you’re sort of given something back for a moment and then it’s snatched off you again.But Hooky had developed a taste for performing the Joy Division songs he hadn’t played for 30 years, and The Light was born. In May 2020 The Light will perform the two Joy Division albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, in full, at the Manchester Apollo and the Brixton Academy. Again, they will be benefiting the Epilepsy Society and Calm. It will be 40 years, almost to the day, since Ian Curtis died.Without taking anything away from any of the musicians Hooky has worked with (his own son Jack has played with Monaco and The Light), I wonder if it wouldn’t just be simpler – and more satisfying for fans – to get the old band back together again to play these classic songs?We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?Hooky thinks for a long moment before musing, “With any group you’re always going to get a problem if the members of the group don’t get on. Look at The Smiths the only two that make most money out of it are Morrissey and Marr. It’s a great shame.”I wonder out loud what The Smiths would be like if they were still together as a band today. Hooky looks at me. “Well, what would New Order be like if they were going today?”And could that be a thing?“What happened at the end of New Order was that Bernard and I had completely different ideas about the group, the music, the attitude to business, and they were that far apart,” he says holding his hands wide. “And the only thing in the middle was Stephen. I had the opinion that Steve agreed with me and then found out afterwards that he seemed to agree with Bernard so I’m looking forward to his book for an explanation of that.“Then they reformed behind my back, and licensed the assets to themselves. Which is not exactly the most honourable thing to do but...” He shrugs. “It’s survival.”There was a long-running court case over Hook’s claim of lost royalties after the band’s “restructuring”, which was settled out of court in 2017. Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert continue under the name New Order.Three decades since Technique, 40 years since Unknown Pleasures. Next year will be the 40th anniversary\u0026nbspof Ian Curtis’s death. Is there any change of a reconciliation on the horizon at all? Over the course of the interview, Hooky seems to have mellowed away from his initial defensive-offensive tactic of getting his attacks in first, albeit done with wry humour as they were. Now he seems almost reflective.“You asked me earlier what would happen if Barney walked in here,” he says. “We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So disappointing when you pay soo much for a once in a lifetime opportunity.”Another commented: “@spicegirls how disappointing to spend money on a ticket to see you @principalitysta and the support act stole the show! Sound was pants!”After Friday’s show, band member Mel B said she hoped the sound “will be much better” at Cardiff.Created with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This retro R\u0026ampB track doesn’t boast the same slick production of some of the more popular Spice Girls songs, but that’s part of the appeal. It could do without Mel B’s rapping, but you can’t have everything.It’s odd that this wasn’t released as a single, because it’s one of the best in the Spice Girls canon: catchy, slickly produced, and with some of the best harmonies the group had to offer. 310 8) \u0027Walk of Life\u0027Did the Spice Girls pull off a reggae track? Kind of (barely), because it’s a lyrical tribute to “straight-talking London town”, which suited the group just fine. The vivacity of these five young women is arguably only more forceful on “Wannabe”. “Spice Up Your Life” was clumsy in its approach as “a song for the world”, with Latin influences and a Bollywood-inspired video, but the energy of the song is what makes it – the result of the five members recording the track in one chaotic afternoon.Despite the rather bizarre safe-sex disclaimer (“Be a little wiser, baby Put it on, put it on”), “2 Become 1” boasts a beautifully textured arrangement and unpolished vocals that capture the group’s unique character. On Spiceworld, “Viva Forever” was a surprisingly moving ballad that reflected on a past love. With the context of Baby Spice (Geri Halliwell) departing from the group with little-to-no warning for fans, many now use it as a fond reflection on what the Spice Girls contributed to pop culture.

Spice Girls told a generation of young girls that friends are more important than boys. This retro R\u0026ampB track doesn’t boast the same slick production of some of the more popular Spice Girls songs, but that’s part of the appeal. It could do without Mel B’s rapping, but you can’t have everything.It’s odd that this wasn’t released as a single, because it’s one of the best in the Spice Girls canon: catchy, slickly produced, and with some of the best harmonies the group had to offer. 310 8) \u0027Walk of Life\u0027Did the Spice Girls pull off a reggae track? Kind of (barely), because it’s a lyrical tribute to “straight-talking London town”, which suited the group just fine. The vivacity of these five young women is arguably only more forceful on “Wannabe”. “Spice Up Your Life” was clumsy in its approach as “a song for the world”, with Latin influences and a Bollywood-inspired video, but the energy of the song is what makes it – the result of the five members recording the track in one chaotic afternoon.Despite the rather bizarre safe-sex disclaimer (“Be a little wiser, baby Put it on, put it on”), “2 Become 1” boasts a beautifully textured arrangement and unpolished vocals that capture the group’s unique character. On Spiceworld, “Viva Forever” was a surprisingly moving ballad that reflected on a past love. With the context of Baby Spice (Geri Halliwell) departing from the group with little-to-no warning for fans, many now use it as a fond reflection on what the Spice Girls contributed to pop culture.

And Mr Raab has said that there is still time to change the controversial backstop arrangements for the Irish border and negotiate a legally binding route for the UK to leave unilaterally.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was ready to form a new negotiation team taking in figures like the DUP’s Arlene Foster and European Research Group chair Jacob Rees-Mogg to persuade Brussels that an amended deal could get through parliament.But an exasperated Mr Juncker\u0026nbspgave short shrift to such plans, telling reporters at a Brussels summit: “I was crystal clear. There will be no renegotiation.”The agreement between the EU and Ms May to delay Brexit until Halloween included a commitment not to seek a renegotiation of the deal. And there is no appetite for further talks from a team of EU officials whose term in office comes to an end in November, when chief negotiator Michel Barnier is slated as a potential replacement for Mr Juncker as commission president.Meanwhile, Mr Bercow said that any suggestion a no-deal Brexit could be engineered by simply running down the clock to the end of October was “for the birds”.Liberal Democrats have warned that a no-deal Brexiteer in Downing Street could even suspend Commons sittings for the vital period this autumn to prevent MPs from finding a way to stop the UK crashing out.And the Institute for Government has warned that, with the death of Ms May’s Withdrawal Agreement Bill – which Downing Street has now accepted will not be tabled in parliament – MPs may have no procedural path to stand in the way of no deal.But the speaker told a US think tank:\u0026nbsp“The idea that parliament is going to be evacuated from the centre stage of debate on Brexit\u0026nbspis unimaginable.”He agreed leaving without a deal was the default position, but added: “There is a difference between a legal default position and what the interplay of different political forces in parliament will facilitate.”As the crowded field of would-be leaders swelled to 10 with the announcement by housing minister Kit Malthouse that he will run, Ms May warned her eventual successor not to leave the EU without a deal.Created with Sketch.Who could succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader?

It would be absolutely catastrophic for us as a party.”But rival candidate Esther McVey, who favours no deal, retorted: “Political suicide actually lies in not having a clean break from the EU and not leaving on 31 October.”The BBC announced it will host a live TV hustings in the middle of June, inviting all contenders still in the race to take part. Mr Raab and health secretary Matt Hancock have already challenged their rivals to a televised debate, amid speculation that Mr Johnson may shy away from the showdown.Mr Hancock said: “I’m delighted that broadcasters have agreed to hold TV debates – this is a contest that affects the whole country, so we should engage the whole country in this process.”The chair of the National Conservative Convention, Andrew Sharpe, has invited all candidates to a hustings on 15 June, when the group had been planning an emergency meeting to hold a vote of no-confidence in Ms May.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We now request the EHRC to look at all the evidence and investigate this matter with great urgency.”The complaint includes allegations of Islamophobia among MPs, an “atmosphere of hostility” against Muslim Conservatives, failed complaints processes and an overall denial that Islamophobia is a major issue for the party.Miqdaad Versi, of the MCB,\u0026nbspquestioned whether any of the contenders in the Tory leadership race would “prioritise dealing with the sheer scale of Islamophobia that has consumed the Conservative Party”.Tory Party faces 110 allegations of Islamophobia and racismWatchdog gives Tories one month to respond to Islamophobia complaintsGovernment rejects proposed definition of IslamophobiaMr Johnson was criticised over remarks comparing veiled Muslim women to letter boxes and bank robbers, but he was cleared of breaching the Conservative Party’s code of conduct.An independent panel found that the former foreign secretary was “respectful and tolerant” in his newspaper column.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), requested more information from the Conservatives on Islamophobia\u0026nbspearlier this month.The watchdog, which enforces equality laws, has the power to take action in court.“We have received complaints regarding the Conservative Party and are considering them in line with our usual processes,” an EHRC spokesperson said.“As part of our standard process, we have written to the Conservative Party to ask for information in order to help assess the complaints.”Afzal Khan raises Islamophobia complaints within Tory party and asks when it will adopt the internationally recognised definition of anti-Muslim hateThe call for an Islamophobia probe came as the EHRC announced a formal investigation over antisemitism in Labour on Tuesday.\u0026nbspIt will determine whether the party “has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish”.The MCB said the timing of its complaint was coincidental and pointed out that it alerted media outlets, including\u0026nbspThe Independent, before the EHRC’s announcement on Labour.Conservatives risk repeating Labour’s mistakes on antisemitismThe government was accused of disregarding the “safety and security of British Muslims” after rejecting a definition of Islamophobia put forward following a parliamentary inquiry.\u0026nbspCommunities secretary James Brokenshire pledged to “arrive swiftly at a collective position” earlier this month, after senior police officers raised concern about the potential impact on counterterror powers.Labour MP Wes Streeting, co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims, said the government had\u0026nbsp“no more credibility to define Islamophobia than the Labour Party had to redefine antisemitism”.“I have watched, with some amazement and even greater despair, the Conservative Party making exactly the same mistakes over Islamophobia as my party has with antisemitism,” he told the House of Commons.The decision came days before research found that more than 100 people claiming to be Conservative Party members had posted Islamophobic or racist comments online.The MCB has repeatedly called for an independent inquiry into prejudice and the handling of complaints within the party.MPs named in the complaint\u0026nbsp(Getty)Dozens of members have been suspended for posting Islamophobic comments on social media, including many directed at leadership contender Sajid Javid.The Conservatives were condemned after reinstating some councillors who had been suspended over racist or prejudiced social media posts.​The government’s commitment to combating anti-Muslim hatred was questioned in the wake of the Christchurch terror attacks, when mosques revealed they had been refused security funding.\u0026nbspWhile the government doubled the pot open for bids from different places of worship, it did not bring the funding up to the £14m awarded specifically to Jewish institutions.Muslim worshippers outside a mosque were targeted in the Finsbury Park terror attack and a man who planned to bomb another mosque in south London was jailed in April.Other incidents have seen women wearing headscarves run over in “revenge” for Islamist atrocities, and a man plough a car into an Indian restaurant because he wanted to “kill a Muslim”.Since the Westminster attack in March 2017, 14 Islamist and five far-right terror plots have been foiled in the UK.\u0026nbspLast week, the Home Affairs Committee was told that more than half of rising hate crime offences recorded by police in England and Wales are committed against Muslims.Muslim Council of Britain\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspEquality and Human Rights Commission\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I was chair of the Labour Party in 2001-2.“I have consistently argued against those who, often in understandable despair at the Labour leadership’s abandonment of Labour’s fundamental values, have either resigned from the Labour Party or joined another party.”Mr Ainsworth, a defence secretary under Gordon Brown\u0027s government, followed suit, revealing he had backed the pro-second referendum Greens last week.Jeremy Corbyn, of all people, should tolerate Alastair CampbellLabour supports Brexit referendum on ‘any deal’, Diane Abbott saysLabour should promise referendum after \u0027kicking\u0027 say Corbyn alliesCorbyn says May \u0027right\u0027 to go as Tory calls her \u0027impediment\u0027 to Brexit“Having recently voted Labour in local elections, I voted Green in the Euro elections having never voted other than Labour before in my entire life,” he told BBC Coventry \u0026amp Warwickshire“I didn\u0027t intend to make this public, but now Alastair has been expelled for doing the same I feel obliged to do so.”Charlie Falconer, another former cabinet minister who probed Labour’s handling of antisemitism, said it was “inconceivable” that the decision was not taken “high up the chain” in the party.Asked about the protest, the Labour party insisted it did not “comment on inidual memberships”. It appeared they might be dealt with less harshly, because their comments – unlike Mr Campbell’s – were not made on TV.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’ve always argued that it’s perfectly possible that Leave would win again, but we’re supporting a people’s vote strongly now because it’s the right thing to do and it’s the democratic thing to do.”Pressure on the Labour leadership ratcheted up several notches after\u0026nbspthe party lost supporters to the Liberal Democrats and Green Party in the EU elections, leaving Labour with just 14 per cent of the vote.Hours after the results were announced, Ms Abbott tweeted: “We have to take the time to analyse the EU vote. But, when we come in third after the Brexit Party, that is a clue something is wrong with our strategy. We need to listen to our members and take a clearer line on a public vote.”Created with Sketch.

She said that\u0026nbspsecuring a general election remained the party’s priority but added: “As the clock\u0026nbsptickets down, if we’re not going to have a general election, we would support a people’s vote.”Jeremy Corbyn has promised a consultation on Labour’s Brexit\u0026nbsppolicy that could end at the party’s annual conference in September, but his close ally Ms Abbott\u0026nbspinsisted he needed to “move quickly”. She said she would personally back Remain in any second referendum.Former prime minister Tony\u0026nbspBlair\u0026nbspsaid he had voted Labour “without great enthusiasm” as he pushed for the party to throw its weight behind a referendum.He said Mr Corbyn “has got to come to a clear position”, telling\u0026nbspSky News: “The one that is very obvious is that both party leaderships have made the same mistake, which is to think that it’s possible to sit on the fence on Europe and appeal to both sides.“What the European elections show you is that isn’t possible.”As Labour isions on Brexit resurfaced in the aftermath of the elections, MPs\u0026nbspin Leave-supporting areas warned against another referendum.Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said it would most likely result in a no-deal outcome.Labour leadership backs ‘public vote’ on BrexitConservatives and Labour hit hard in EU election routLabour should promise referendum after ‘kicking’ say Corbyn alliesLabour must back second referendum or face election loss, Watson warnsShe said: “Obviously in constituencies like Wigan you get very mixed views, you get different views like everywhere in the country, but to most people the idea of a second referendum just seems quite absurd.“People were asked what they think, you can see from the results that we had here, that very few people have changed their minds and if there is a shift in this area of the country I think it’s towards no-deal Brexit.”Ms Nandy added: “I think we’ve got to wake up to the seriousness, not just of what we’re about to do to the Labour Party, but what we’re about to do the country because I strongly suspect that if there is a second referendum people here would come out and vote in fairly large numbers and probably vote for no deal.”She went on: “There is a huge frustration amongst Labour voters who voted Leave, in towns like mine, to see leading figures from the Labour Party out calling for a second referendum before there’s been any serious attempt to implement the result of the first.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But with Britain off the menu at Tuesday’s meeting – which was\u0026nbspstrictly about choosing Jean-Claude Juncker’s successor – the prime minister was, for once, fed.Some wondered why she bothered to come, given her lame-duck status and the fact Britain is supposed to be leaving the EU. But she didn’t appear to care – arriving with the unusually cheerful demeanour of someone who’s had a ton of Brexit bricks lifted from her shoulders.She told reporters\u0026nbspthat she was in town because while Britain was still an EU member, it had all the same rights and obligations of any other country in the union – including choosing its next commission president. Perhaps worrying that this was a bit forthright, she quickly added that Britain, of course, would abide by the rules of “sincere cooperation” – Eurocrat speak for not taking the piss.\u0026nbspIn the room, the body language between May and her counterparts seemed genuinely warmer than usual. She took an overfamiliar embrace from Mr Juncker in her stride, meeting his gaze. Earlier in the week he’d told the world’s media through a spokesperson that she was a “courageous” leader. It was not long ago that in the same room that the prime minister was confronting him for supposedly calling her “nebulous”. For once, it looked like she was having a nice time.This won’t be the prime minister’s final visit to the EU capital – she’s due to come again in June for another scheduled meeting, where her fellow leaders will probably bid her a more formal farewell. It’s unlikely she’ll miss the city – which she claimed she had visited “something like 50” times – it is, after all, the site of some of her greatest political humiliations.\u0026nbspTory leadership candidates told there will be no Brexit renegotiationWhile the leaders tucked into their melon and dried figs (for that was the starter), the absence of Brexit did not go uncommented upon on the conference floor. Some European journalists, only half joking, openly celebrated the fact that the usual caravan of hacks from Westminster who follow the prime minister’s every move had mostly decided it wasn’t worth it this time.“The Brits actually stole the spot usually used by Belgian journos,” one Brussels local complained. Another quipped that they had been “spared the horde” of Brits that had been “invading” the last few meetings and taking up valuable desk space.It’s probably too early for them to celebrate. Brexit will be back here with a vengeance in October. And possibly for a long time after that, too.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead, it charged a yearly fee of 99 cents in order to generate revenue and cover the costs of hosting the chats of millions of users.WhatsApp experienced huge growth following the Facebook takeover\u0026nbspand now boasts more than 1.5 billion users from around 180 countries, however it has since softened its stance on adverts.WhatsApp co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton\u0026nbsphave both left the messaging app in recent years and have been critical of Facebook\u0027s attempts to monetise the app.In 2012, two years before the Facebook takeover, Mr Koum explained WhatsApp\u0027s stance towards advertising by quoting the movie\u0026nbspFight Club.Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can by shit we don\u0027t need, he wrote in a blog post.

Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In Indonesia hunters use dogs to track down dens, then shoot, electrocute or smoke the parents out. The same is thought to happen in Thailand. In Japan some traders have set up captive breeding centres nextdoor to cafes, but most animals are still imported – changing hands for large sums of money.Not only is the trade cruel because the stolen otters are given unsuitable homes, diets and surroundings, but worse – it is driving down populations of the species, according to the investigators.All four species native to Southeast Asia – the Asian small-clawed, the smooth-coated, the hairy-nosed and the Eurasian otter, are already in decline from habitat loss and climate change, but now the “exotic” pet trade poses a new threat, the report says. The hairy-nosed species has plummeted by half in three decades.\u0026nbspGekoski)In Japan, where more than a dozen animal cafes have otters, investigators found otters whimpering, shrieking and making distress calls while customers played with them. \u0026nbspSome animals were kept with no natural light or even without water. Others bit their claws and showed other signs of trauma, the witnesses reported.With more dealers cashing in, online activity has grown. The largest Indonesian Facebook group for buying and selling otters has 43,000 members. Other Indonesian groups have up to 16,000 members and all are very active, the charity said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGekoski)“Despite it being illegal to hunt, trade or breed them in Thailand, the country seems to have an abundance of new-born otters quickly and readily available for sale,” according to the report.Across the region rescue groups are struggling to keep up with the numbers of abandoned otters, which often arrive malnourished and underweight.Just because a wild animal is cute does not mean you should take it home\u0026nbspCassandra Koenen, of the charity, says: “Just because a wild animal is cute, it does not mean you should take it home with you. Unfortunately, this fact appears to be lost on many people as they are influenced by social media, and influencers showing them off as fun and cool pets. \u0026nbsp“Once otters are in people’s homes, there is no realistic way to replicate the space and freedom these animals would have in the wild. Many animals are kept in spaces vastly smaller than their natural habitats and they don’t have the correct nutrition, even if owners have their best intentions to feed them properly.”  \u0026nbspInvestigators were also told police and government officials help the trade. “One report from Indonesia stated a government worker requested operations on otters to remove the gland that causes them to smell, to make them more appealing as pets,” according to the document.\u0026nbspWAP is calling on social media users not to “like” posts featuring captive otters and wants the two non-protected species to be given the highest level of protection at the next Cites meeting.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Heres the lowdown on the iconic tower.It is thought that the bell was originally to be called Royal Victoria in honour of Queen Victoria but Londoners started calling the bell Big Ben and the name stuck.The origin of the nickname remains the subject of some debate.It is believed Big Ben was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who oversaw the installation of the Great Bell.Others believe the bell was named after boxer Ben Caunt, who was the English Heavyweight Champion.Formerly known as the Clock Tower, the structure was renamed the Elizabeth Tower in  in honour of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in .But it is the bell within the tower that is referred to as Big Ben.Standing at  feet high, the tower is the focal point of the Grade I-listed Palace of Westminster, which forms part of a UNESCO World Heritage site.The Elizabeth Tower is also the most photographed building in the UK.And now the clocks cogs and hands, as well as the four dials, will be removed, cleaned up and repaired as part of the work.Because the clock mechanism will be temporarily out of action, a modern electric motor will drive the clock hands until the clock is reinstated.Completed in , the tower was designed by architects Charles Barry and Augustus Welby Pugin and took  years to build.Its construction required  cubic metres of brick and  cubic metres of stone.Big Ben chimed for the first time on July , .The -tonne Great Bell was last stopped for maintenance in  and before that was halted for two years in  for refurbishment.The current restoration project will mark the longest period of silence for the bell.However, it will still sound on big occasions such as New Years Day and Remembrance Sunday.Big Ben houses four clocks and their dials are set in an iron frame that is  feet in diameter.On each side,  shards of opal class make up the clock face.The copper minute hands are  feet long as tall - as a double decker bus - these famous dials have kept London running on time.It chimes every hour on the hour to the note of E and also houses bells that chime every quarter-hour - their strikes are controlled by the intricate ticking mechanism at the heart of the tower.There are huge weights on long cables that attach to each train of gears.Clock engineers wind the cables three times a week and as gravity pulls the weights down, the trains rotate.Their rotation is regulated by the escapement and the swinging pendulum.It keeps the clock accurate to within one second.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is just the beginning.In a warning to the Westminster parties, he said: If we dont leave on October  then the scores you have seen for the Brexit Party today will be repeated in a general election, and we are getting ready for it.Mr Farage repeated his demand for the Brexit Party to be involved in the negotiations ahead of the Halloween deadline.All EU citizens, as long as they are registered to vote, have the right to vote in the European elections.The UK uses the D’Hondt system of proportional representation which means the number of MEPs a party wins is directly related to the percentage of votes it receives.Voters choose a single party instead of an inidual candidate.This means all political parties have the chance to send representatives to the European Parliament.The proportion of seats given by a party directly reflects the proportion of votes won.In the first round of counting, the party with the most votes is allocated a seat for the candidate at the top of its list.Under the D’Hondt method, each party’s total number of votes is repeatedly ided – until all seats are filled – by isor  + the number of seats already allocated.If it is still top it gains another seat. If not, whichever party has the most votes then gets the seat instead.The original vote count of the largest party in each round is ided by one plus the total number of seats they have already been allocated, until all the seats for the region have been handed out.Although the method is considered to be one of the most constant and representative forms of voting, the results do not exactly reflect the votes, as this would lead to parties winning fractions of seats.EU voters go to the polls every five years to elect Members of the European Parliament .Each country has a specic number of seats based on their population size.The smallest is Malta and they have six seats, whereas the largest is Germany with .There are  MEPs in total and the UK has .Candidates can stand independently or with a party.They will represent a region of their country, and the number of MEPs for each region depends on population.The government confirmed the country would be taking part in the EU elections in early May after May administration was forced to push back the date it was leaving the bloc because MPs could not get a majority for her withdrawal agreement.As the UK was still in the EU at the time of the elections it is forced to take part even though the majority of voters said they wanted to leave in the referendum vote.The UK went to the polls to elect MEPs on May , .The vote is said to have cost around £million to hold.If a Brexit deal is agreed before the election date or soon after then the UK’s MEPS will not take their seats.Butthat doesn’t happen then the newly elected MEPs will take their place in the European Parliament – which sits in Brussels and Strasbourg - in early July.European Council President Donald Tusk has said that MEPs could sit for “months or even longer”the negotiations drag on.At this stage, how long the UK MEPs will continue to sit is anyones guess.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Labour didn’t administer that kicking — instead they lost votes everywhere from Britain’s industrial heartlands to North London’s organic groceries.The message is clear: A plague on all your houses. And the lessons the parties should learn are equally obvious.For the Tories, it is that they have no God-given right to power. And their failure to deliver Brexit could be their death knell unless they get on the right track, sharpish.The leadership battle is already doing them serious damage as it turns all too quickly into a circular firing squad.We’ve got nothing against bright youngsters like Rory Stewart taking a punt at the premiership, but having a pop at colleagues on day one won’t help rebuild the party’s battered reputation.But that’s nothing compared to the current Chancellor threatening to bring down the Governmenta new leader pushes for a clean-break Brexit, evenhis party’s MPs and members vote for exactly that.If Hammond hasn’t clocked that failing to deliver the referendum result isn’t endearing the party to voters, these European results are a blunt reminder.Everybody who fancies the top job needs to explain, in detail, their Brexit plan. Andthey win, the party MUST deliver it. No s, no buts.Winning back Brexit Party voters is vital, but so is moving on from the referendum and pushing forward with a revitalised domestic programme.As for Labour  All that game-playing in Westminster hasn’t done them much good.But they still haven’t learnt.Emily Thornberry’s reaction to the Brexit Party’s streaking triumph around the country was to come out in favour of a second referendum.Working people have abandoned this prehistoric party and their dinosaur leader in droves.The European elections should never have happened. We should be out of the EU by now.For the Government, time could not be more pressing.

It’s time for a new generation to lead the charge into our future with boldness and vision.We must strengthen our Union, and the people we serve need a new social contract. A good job, a secure home and a brilliant school are the nuts and bolts of a happy le.As Housing Minister, it’s been my mission to build more high-quality homes as fast as we can, and numbers are looking good but there is much more work to do. We must pledge to offer these essentials to everyone: Job, House, School.I’ve run my own company for more than two decades, and weathered some really tough times, so I understand the opportunities and challenges small businesses face.We must revolutionise our economy, freeing a new generation of entrepreneurs to take risks and build businesses, creating jobs and wealth.And crucially we must spread that wealth with radical policies that make it easier for employees to own a stake in the business they work for, and to own shares generally. Everyone should have a piece of the national balance sheet.The Conservative Party must become the party of children, with their welfare, protection and future at the heart of everything we do.All of us have only one chance at childhood. It’s the foundation of our hopes, aspirations and character. There must be an all-out assault on child poverty, and we need to make the lives of parents easier.I’ve had political responsibility for a challenging social services department and London’s police force.Four years focused on a terrying surge in youth violence – and getting it under control – confirmed my view that education is the only social policy that consistently works.It is an escape route from a dead end, and the bedrock of social mobility. It’s also the reason I, and millions like me, got where we are.As Prime Minister I would make ours the party of well-funded schools, investing in the future of each and every child.That means investing heavily in science to tackle climate change and disease.As the chair of London Hydrogen, I promoted the green, British hydrogen fuel cell, and I founded the le sciences hub MedCity. I’ve led the debate on science in Parliament, and green tech would be central to my mission.We won’t get the chance to take on these and other pressing challenges unless we first work together to get Brexit completed.These steps - unity, a viable Brexit plan and a compelling domestic agenda - will secure a bright future for our remarkable country.I got into politics to get things done. As Deputy Mayor for Policing in the capital I drove action to cut teen killings by % and devised our first ever violence against women and girls strategy.I would bring this experience of fighting crime to being Prime Minister. As a councillor I led the effort that halved rough sleepers in central London, and now I’m building houses for the young.I’m a Northern boy who built a business in the Midlands and now represents a stunning part of Hampshire.My granddad was a Yorkshire wagon driver, my grandma a teacher, and my Mum and Dad were the first in their families to go to university.My family’s story is one of education, hard work and opportunity, and that’s what I want for everyone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Sunday it took several minutes to establish whether or not one of them, Wheeler Dealer, could impersonate an animal.When it does get going the show can very occasionally feel like arriving two hours late at the pub. Everyone’s laughing but you’ve no idea why.For the most part, though, The Ranganation belongs to the same comedy applause school as The Last Leg, Mash Report and New World Order.They’ll clap anything here, in fact. Romesh’s mum admits taking a curry to the cinema . Nigel Farage gets covered in milkshake . The Dogfather telling us to: “Stop raping the planet,” .Although, I say anything, the moment it broke down was when half a dozen people applauded the idea of Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister and, woah!, Romesh had to threaten them, jokingly, with ejection.They’d broken the rules, you see. Shows like The Ranganation like to think of themselves as edgy, but they’re very tightly governed by the laws of political correctness.This means you no longer have to be funny to be a stand-up or comedy host, but you must be on-message, which is why, paradoxically, we’ve never had more comedians on telly but so few actual laughs.Flogging them to death doesn’t work either. You may have found Katherine Ryan and Romesh funny the first time you saw them, but you’re probably fed up with the sight of them by their thousandth appearance.As for the actual process of this show The Ranganation wasn’t sure dating apps worked and milkshake throwing was also a grey area, but the host definitely thought we could save the planet by not flushing our toilets.“So do you mindI come round your house and p*** like a horse ”It’d be appreciated, ta.Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I am not morbidly obese.”Good Morning Britain, Kevin Maguire: “There are quite a few Leave voters at the BBC.”And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “Honestly,Andi Peters was in  Hunks, which he should be, he’d be scoring .” Out of what, Susanna OVER on BBC’s look-into-the-future drama Years And Years, all-out nuclear war between China and America seems to have fizzled out after one episode.The good news, though, is it seems to have released enough radiation poisoning to kill off Jessica Hynes’s character, Edith, the campaigner, activist and all-round pain-in-the-ar*e, within the next couple of episodes.If you think that’ll be the end of the political lecture, however, you couldn’t be more wrong.Writer Russell T Davies is far too hot under the collar about America, Israel, “the West”, bankers, privatisation and “NHS cuts” to get off his high horse any time soon.Weirdly, he also wants Years And Years viewers to try and believe that, in the not-too-distant future, a Christian regime, in the Ukraine, will be torturing gay people.Which, given that homosexuality is currently and exclusively a death penalty offence in ten Islamic states, has to be one of the most cowardly distortions of reality I’ve ever seen on a television drama.Far less sinister, but almost as tiresome, is the continued presence of Alexander Armstrong on Years And Years.He turned up hosting a  edition of Have I Got News For You in the first episode, and then reappeared fronting Pointless Celebrities, in the year , last week.So don’t expect any sympathyhe reappears tonight on Best Ever Christmas , still murdering Fields Of bloody Gold.You’ve been given your four-minute warning.Michael Owen: “It was great opportunityism from the striker.”And Neil Lennon: “It’s a once-in-a-letime opportunity that’s come round again.”Victoria Coren Mitchell’s nauseating love-in with MP Jess Phillips on Have I Got News For You.Piers Morgan telling Le Stories guest Mel B The Spice Girls were “the female Beatles”, when they weren’t even the female Tremeloes.Hollyoaks actor Maxim Baldry attempting a Ukrainian accent in Years And Years.Every bone-idle chancer in Britain interpreting “Bank Holiday Monday” as “Take Friday off as well”.And Britain’s Got Talent auditions getting lost in sob stories, sentimentality and all those magical charisma voids who begin by announcing: “I need someone to come up and help me.” BZZZZZ, “Next ”B “Form a conga with Seumas Milne and start celebrating.”C “We don’t know.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  Serbian Branislav Ivanovic joined which London-based football team ”I’d have had these people housed in the sort of lodges we give away on this programme.”But you weren’t, so stop playing the hero and just link to your rip-off phone-line competition. Picture research by Alfie Snelling.NEVER a good sign, is it, when you vomit up your own decomposed internal organs, have to be buried in a zinc coffin and a cement mixer turns up to your funeral That’s the thing about Sky Atlantic’s Chernobyl, though, it spares you no details about the greatest technological catastrophe of the th century.

Tory MEPs were almost wiped out.It was expected, but that cannot hide the seriousness of the Conservatives’ crisis. Not only did most voters abandon them — even the majority of their own members voted for the Brexit Party.Many others, including me, refused to take part in a ballot that should never have taken place, for an organisation that we should not be part of.No party can last for long with its vote in freefall and its activists staying home or supporting a rival.The Tories must find a way to regain trust, inspire their troops and win back millions of lost voters.That means being completely honest and clear about why this happened. It is human nature to look for comforting excuses to explain away shocking news. But that would be no use.This crisis is entirely self-inflicted. The Conservatives gave the people a referendum and promised, before, during and after, to do as voters decided.Theresa May pledged scores of times that we would leave the EU, deal or no deal, in March.She broke that promise and her Cabinet colleagues let her do it. As Daniel Hannan, one of the Party’s surviving MEPs, put it: “People voted to leave three years ago and we haven’t left, it’s as simple as that.”Many voters were already deeply unhappy about the way the PM kept watering down and abandoning her negotiating red lines. Ditching the Brexit deadline was the last straw and pushed them over the edge. Step one of recovery is clear: Brexit must happen.If there’s a glimmer of hope it’s that May has agreed to resign. Imagineshe was still barricaded in Downing Street — more time would be wasted on the struggle to prise her out of the building.Instead, the race to succeed her has begun. No more politely pretending that “there’s no vacancy”. Instead, the MPs who hope to be the next Prime Minister can openly set out their stalls.There is no time to waste. This has got to be a proper contest, to produce a leader whose abilities and ideas have been thoroughly tested. The stakes are as high.Tory members, disillusioned, frustrated and bruised, want totheir party to winning ways. Democrats want the Leave vote to be honoured.And everyone wants to hear the proposals put forward by those who want to govern.The only option is to get this right and keep that essential promise.

Danny Accoin said he could identy a flying object on his radar, missile system and infared camera but couldn’t actually see it in his helmet camera.A minute-long video appears to show two encounters with the enigmatic phenomena where the pilots talk to each other about what they see on the radar screens.“Look at that thing. It’s rotating,” one of them said.“Wow, what is that, man ” another exclaims. “Look at it fly!”At first the pilots interviewed in the report thought the objects were part of a top-secret drone program.But after the near-collision they reason that government officials knew there were fighter pilots in the area and would not send drones to get in the way.Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher said it’s unclear what caused the sightings detailed in the article.The Times report comes after the Navy in April sent out a new classied guidance for how to report the “unexplained aerial phenomena.”A number of reports ensued but some cases could have been commercial drones, Gradisher said.But, in other cases: “We don’t know who’s doing this, we don’t have enough data to track this. So the intent of the message to the fleet is to provide updated guidance on reporting procedures for suspected intrusions into our airspace.”Neither Graves nor the other pilots or the Department of Defence would speculate on what the objects were.“We’re here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths,” one pilot said. The Department of Defence went as far to reveal they will continue to probe such reports in a bid to keep the nation safe.A spokesperson for the the Department of Defence was forced to admit that reports, claiming their investigations were stopped in , were not true.OFFICIAL STATEMENTSpeaking to the NY Post, Christopher Sherwood said in a statement: The Department of Defence is always concerned about maintaining positive identication of all aircraft in our operating environment, as well as identying any foreign capability that may be a threat to the homeland.“The department will continue to investigate, through normal procedures, reports of unidentied aircraft encountered by US military aviators in order to ensure defense of the homeland and protection against strategic surprise by our nation’s adversaries.”WHAT IS THE ADVANCED AEROSPACE THREAT IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM The investigations are part of the US governments, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identication Programme .The program began in  and was run by military intelligence official, Luis Elizondo.The existence of the AATIP was revealed in , along with a -second DOD video that shows an airborne object being chased by two Navy jets off the coast of San Diego in .Defence experts across the world have been left shell shocked by this bombshell revelation.Nick Pope who launched secret probes into UFOs for the UK during the s said this new admission makes it clear that they really did study what the public would call UFOs.UFOs have been repeatedly investigated by the American military, including a study code-named Project Blue Book which started in .A version of this story originally appeared on the NY Post."},{"url":null,"title":"alastair campbell expelled labour voting lib dems","story":"The Labour veteran has his membership revoked for publicly backing another party in the European elections.Mr Campbell blasted Labour for kicking him out - when activists accused of anti-Semitism have been allowed to stay in.The spin doctor was Mr Blairs press secretary in  Downing Street then became Labours press secretary and campaign director.He is known as one of the ex-PMs closest allies and is now a leading figure in the Peoples Vote campaign.Mr Campbell revealed on Sunday night that he voted Lib Dem in protest against Jeremy Corbyns flip-flopping on Brexit.He said today: Sad and disappointed to receive email expelling me from Labour particularly on a day leadership finally seems to be moving to the right place on Brexit, not least thanks to tactical voting by party members, including MPs, councillors and peers who back a second referendum.I am and always will be Labour.

The same pattern was repeated where.In Germany, a surge for the Greens brought the long dominant Christian Democrats their worst result in decades.In France, Marine Le Pen’s right-wing National Rally topped the poll, and the two traditional centrist parties – the Republicans and the Socialists – almost disappeared.Even more dramatic gains for the Eurosceptics could be found in Italy. The nationalist League was far in front, with  per cent of the vote, while the maverick, rebellious Five Star movement won  per cent, putting the Italian anti-EU forces in an absolute majority.Populists also triumphed in Hungary, where Viktor Orban Civic Alliance gained no less than  per cent of the vote, and in Poland, where the right-wing Law and Justice party was victorious with  per cent.Indeed, throughout Europe there were advances for anti-establishment politicians - whether it be the Greens in Ireland or the nationalists in Sweden.As triumphant Greens edge out centre-left and centre-right parties, the EU will become even more polarised and ided, which will make it harder for parliament to .All this change is driven by widespread outrage at the disaster that the EU has inflicted on the countries of Europe.Without any mandate, the unaccountable, power-mad cabal in Brussels has weakened the fabric of the continent.National democracy has been pulverised by the quest for EU unication.National identities have been undermined by mass immigration on an unprecedented scale, particularly after the German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the floodgates in .National economic interests have been sacriced on the altar of the European single currency.The EU fanatics like to paint populism as a form of extremism but, on the contrary, it is the natural response to the removal of democratic rights and freedoms.Across Europe, people want their countries back. They have had enough of betrayal.They prefer to govern themselves rather than be ruled by unelected officials.They are tired of being labelled bigots simply for feeling a sense of patriotism, that noble ideal which is really an extension of love of family.The real extremists are those EU zealots who show contempt for the ideas of national pride and sovereignty.Yet, there is no sign that the Brussels regime, cocooned by its ideology, has woken up to the scale of the upheaval.Just the opposite is true.Since yesterday, the EU ruling elite and its cheerleaders have indulged in a gigantic propaganda exercise, pretending that the results are not that signicant, that the populist insurgency has been exaggerated, that the barbarians have been held at the gates.In this climate of delusion, it is asnothing has happened.An attitude of business as usual prevails, as shown by today’s Brussels summit, where European leaders discussed the preparations for choosing a new EU President and Commission, given that the term of Jean Claude Juncker will soon end.In the time-honoured fashion of the EU’s institutions, another establishment stitch-up is probably on the way.Beyond mouthing a few empty words about reform, Brussels bosses seem to have learned no lesson from the anti-establishment fury.That is because they are so obsessed with the grand European project of political unity.Since its foundation in the s, the entire purpose of European Community has been the creation of a federal superstate.Every policy, every treaty is focused on the mission of ever closer union towards the ultimate goal of a United States of Europe.Nothing is allowed to stand in the way of this crusade. Even democracy and nationhood must be sacriced for the sake of the integrationist dogma.At the entrance to the Visitors Centre in the European Parliament, there is a plaque with the words, “National sovereignty is the root cause of the most crying evils of our time”, for which the “final remedy is the federal union of the people.”That was written by the British diplomat Lord Lothian, a committed appeaser right up to . His spirit still permeates the corridors of power in Brussels.Federalism explains why the EU is so addicted to the abolition of borders through free movement, because the obliteration of national identities will promote the new concept of European citizenship.Similarly, the creation of the single currency in  was not primarily an economic initiative but a political vehicle to enforce integration by undermining national independence.Through its arrogance, the EU is sowing the seeds for its own destruction.Without change, Brussels will become ever more crisis-ridden, ever more in-debted, ever more unpopular.The betrayal of the public is unsustainable in the long-term. In fact, collapse could arrive swtly in the coming decade, either through another financial crisis or through another major country, like Italy or France, deciding to leave.If the Brussels bosses had any sense, they would abandon their ideological project and instead make the union just a trading bloc of free, independent nations.That is what Britain was meant to have joined in  when we signed up for the Common Market, only to find we were sucked into the federalist quagmire.The British people eventually woke up to this reality.We had the courage to vote for independence - and Brexit is the spark that has helped to fuel the flames of rebellion across the continent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most Remainers want another referendum.The moment when both sides might have accepted a compromise — ideally a Swiss-type solution that would have taken us out of the EU’s political structures while retaining close economic links — has probably passed.So whose fault is it that we are in this situation  Hardliners on both sides must take their share of the blame.Those Remainers who promised to respect the result but then worked to frustrate it have done terrible damage to our politics.Those Leavers who, forgetting everything they said during the campaign, now insist that anything short of No Deal is a betrayal, have likewise destroyed trust in the system.But the chief responsibility lies with Theresa May.It was she who dug in on the wrong issues while conceding on the wrong issues, who mulishly insisted that it was all about immigration, who managed to convince both sides that she was secretly working for the other, who so aggravated EU leaders that, by the end, they were predisposed to reject anything she asked for because it was she who was doing the asking.Worst of all, she called and then lost the  election. From that moment, it was clear that our Parliament was prepared to frustrate Brexit.The EU got the message and started making deliberately absurd and vindictive demands, culminating in the Irish backstop which, incredibly, Theresa May accepted.We now face withdrawal terms so disadvantageous that they are worse than either staying or quitting — exactly as Michel Barnier intended.Which brings us back to the Catch-.Parliament does not intend to allow any government to leave the EU with No Deal, and the Commons Speaker has made clear that he is prepared to bend the rules in any way necessary to secure that end.In normal times, a Conservative leader would go to the country saying: “Give me the mandate I need. If Brussels knows we are ready for No Deal, we will get a good deal. We just need the numbers in Parliament.“Do you want me in charge, or a Marxist nostalgic who refuses to have a position on Brexit ”In normal times, such a leader would win comfortably. But these are not normal times.A large chunk of the electorate is now disposed to blame the Conservatives for the impasse rather than the parties that have actually been voting against Brexit.Nigel Farage has confirmed that he plans to contest every seat at the next election. The idea that he might stand aside in certain constituencies in order to stop Corbyn is based on a misunderstanding of how he operates.He is back at the head of a populist insurgent party.The last thing he wants is to have that party’s grievance addressed and so put himself out of business.Is there any solution  Possibly.It may be that Parliament cannot in fact block a No Deal Brexit. It may be that,forced to choose, MPs will baulk at voting to revoke Article .It may be that France, or another EU state, vetoes any extension beyond October  — though that is unlikely.Or it may be that the Tories could, in fact, win a general election.Perhaps I am wrong about Farage’s motivations, and he will agree to an electoral pact, fighting Labour in the North while standing aside in the South.Or maybe there’s another way out of the jam, one I can’t think of.But what cannot be denied is that the dilemma exists.There is no point in saying, “Just leave!” or “I’ll get us a better deal!” unless you are clear about how you intend to do it.The trouble is that, in the current mood, those are precisely the slogans that many Tory activists want to hear.The candidate who levels with them, who sets out the dilemma honestly and outlines a proposed route out of it, may become unelectable.

Secondly, I do feel that now is a time in which momentous events are taking place and there are great issues to be resolved and in those circumstances, it doesn’t seem to me sensible to vacate the chair.”Bercow yesterday told a US audience it was “unimaginable” MPs won’t be able to act despite a No Deal exit being the legal default and warned there are years of debate ahead” on Brexit.The arch-Remainers words fly in the face of Tory leadership front runners Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab, who have both guaranteed the UK will leave the EU by Halloween - with or without a deal.Mr Bercow also fuelled the peoples vote campaign by suggesting MPs had the right to force a second referendum or even revoke Article .He said: They can’t be wished away or snfed at, but these matters were matters decided by the last Parliament. No Parliament can bind the hands of its successor. This Parliament can do as this Parliament thinks fit.Bercow broke his pledge to stand down by June last year.When he stood to be Speaker in  he promised only to serve for nine years but he has justied staying on longer because of the uncertainty caused by Brexit.But European Commission President Jean Claude Junker delivered a stark message to candidates in the race to replace Theresa May.Speaking to television cameras outside a summit in Brussels he said: There will be no renegotiation.The Eurocrats stubborn stance is bad news for Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunts Tory leadership bid. Yesterday, he said his Brexit policy was to try for renegotiation.Britain is on course to leave the EU on October  with or without a deal - unless the law is changed to extend further.There is currently no provision for MPs to amend the law to stop Britain leaving without a deal and leadership contenders such as Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab have warned they may end up going for it.But Mr Bercow’s comments yesterday signal he is willing to help create a way for MPs to block a No Deal Brexit.He said there was “no inevitability” about a No Deal Brexit and dismissed the suggestion that MPs had lost their chance to block No Deal once and for all.The only way to completely rule out a No Deal Brexit is for Britain to revoke Article .A request for a further extension could be blocked by just one EU member state - meaning Britain would leave without a deal on October .Speaking at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC, the Speaker said: “There is a dference between a legal default position and what the interplay of dferent political forces in parliament will facilitate.”He added: “The idea that parliament is going to be evacuated from the centre stage of debate on Brexit is unimaginable.”“The appetite for the house to have its say has recently been whetted and that appetite is not exhausted. Indeed some would say it’s voracious.“The house will want to have its say. The idea that the house will not have it say is for the birds. Parliament is a big player in this.“The idea that Parliament is going to be evacuated from the centre stage of debate on Brexit is unimaginable. It is simply unimaginable.”Tory MP Andrew Bridgen blasted: “This is further evidence -ever we needed it - of his Remain-supporting bias throughout the Brexit process. He’s a self-proclaimed Remainer who has ripped out every rule of impartiality from the Speaker’s rulebook.“Whoever the new leader of the Conservative party is will have to fight not only a Remain-dominated Parliament but also a Remain-supporting Speaker.”He added: “One thing’s for certain - John Bercow, the impartial Speaker, always has his say - everyday in Parliament, it’s almost like Speaker’s Question Time with Points of Order.”Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “In respect of the Speaker, we are subject to European law until the day we leave and European law is very clear that we leave on a set date unless a request for an extension is made and the EU grants that extension. That’s it.So Parliament only gets its say in terms of legislation, it can’t take over the Government at any stage, it can’t run the legislative programme, so it’s European law that will get the final say.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn back second referendum this week","story":"In a major Brexit betrayal, the Euro-sceptic leader could cave in to Remainers demands and back a so-called Peoples Vote - perhaps in the next few days.Labour sources told The Mirror the -year-old was expected to back a peoples vote as early as this week.Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford fuelled speculation there could be a breakthrough.He said: “He continues to get advice from a iety of dferent sources.

Candidates for Tory leader are lining up to back a hard exit in a pitch to the partyaposs , voting members. Some are fighting against crashing out of the EU without a deal - with Jeremy Hunt branding the plan suicide. But none are fighting to stop Brexit altogether, and none are fighting to hold a second referendum. Whoever wins the Tory leadership contest will be in  Downing Street by the end of July, and try to put their strategy in place over the summer.  That means they will have a massive impact on how we leave the EU on October , or whether we do at all. The EU could offer an extension beyond Halloween , or Parliamentary gridlock could force a general election. Britainaposs electoral system means we vote for MPs, not a PM - who whoeveraposs in power can steer Brexit without an election by you, the public. Instead the nationaposs policy looks set to be decided by the , Tories who vote in the leadership contest. So what are the candidatesapos positions on Brexit  And how likely are they to crash us out without a deal  Weaposve profiled their positions below - carefully finding comments theyaposve made since coming out for leadership.  All the candidates - ranked from most to least BrexityEsther McVey HARD BREXIT RATING:    The Tory MP for Tatton is arguably the hardest Brexiteer on the ticket and says we should get ready to leave the EU with no deal. She demanded Brexit happens deal or no deal on October , no matter how damaging for business - something she called a clean Brexit. She said the next leader of the Tories has to be a Brexiteer as the failure to deliver Brexit has left many in the party demoralised. And she refused to rule out a pact with Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party, telling the : Nigel Farage is a tour de force. He has changed the narrative. He has caught the mood of the moment. Ms McVey quit as Work and Pensions Secretary in protest at Theresa Mayaposs Brexit plans. Andrea Leadsom HARD BREXIT RATING:    The former Cabinet minister has declared she would lead Britain out the EU with or without a deal in October. To succeed in a negotiation you have to be prepared to walk away, she said. She previously described the UKaposs continued membership of the EU as disgusting and claimed that a Brexiteer PM would have delivered Brexit already. And she was the final Cabinet resignation in a chain that fuelled Theresa Mayaposs eventual decision to quit. Ms Leadsom said she would introduce a citizensapos rights Bill to resolve uncertainty facing EU nationals. She would also seek agreement in other areas where consensus already exists, such as on reciprocal healthcare and Gibraltar. Dominic Raab HARD BREXIT RATING: .   The former Brexit Secretary backs leaving without a deal on October  -thataposs what it takes. He has said Britain should be getting a fairer deal and he would prefer to leave with a renegotiated deal. But he added the UK must calmly demonstrate unflinching resolve to leave in October - at the latest. Critics fear his hardline views will make him more likely to walk out of negotiations with the EU. That would plunge the UK into no-deal in October, or could force a general electionMPs revolt against the government. Mr Raab walked out of the Cabinet in November in protest at Theresa Mayaposs deal and has said itaposs time for a new direction. Boris Johnson HARD BREXIT RATING: .   The frontrunner declared heaposs prepared to crash out of the EU with no deal on October . We will leave the EU on October , deal or no deal, Mr Johnson said in May . To get things done you need to be prepared to walk away. But behind the scenes heaposs been less hardline, telling moderate MPs his preference is still a negotiated exit. One insider in his camp told the Mirror: He knows that no deal would be damaging. Butyou want to renegotiate youaposve got to keep it on the table. The problem for moderate Tory MPs, members and the public is this - which Boris Johnson should they believe  Leadership rival Rory Stewart compared him to liar Pinocchio, saying Borisapos no deal promise went back on pledges he made in private. And heaposs famously chosen his views opportunistically, coming out for Leave in  at the moment of maximum impact despite writing an article for each side. He did however burnish his Brexiteer credentials by quitting Cabinet in protest at Theresa Mayaposs deal. Kit Malthouse HARD BREXIT RATING:    The Housing Minister, who voted Leave in , has emphasised the need for a cross-party Brexit plan rather than crashing out with No Deal. While I voted to leave the EU, I know that without unity across the UK, we cannot get a deal over the line, he said. Part of his plan, however - the so-called aposMalthouse Compromiseapos - involves mitigating a possible No-Deal Brexit. Critics also believe the plan is unworkable. If we leave with a deal, the plan would extend the transition period through to December . It would also renegotiate arrangements for the Irish border using as-yet-unclear technological solutions. It we leave without a deal, we would ask to pay the EU for a standstill arrangement ensuring tarfs and harsh border rules donapost suddenly kick in. Sajid Javid HARD BREXIT RATING: .   The Home Secretary has said his party must get on and deliver Brexit adding: Itaposs time to rebuild trust, find unity and create new opportunities across the UK. But he did not immediately clary whether he would take Britain out of the EU without a deal on October . The -year-old backed Remain in the referendum but has since positioned himself as a firm Leaver. James Cleverly HARD BREXIT RATING: .   The Brexit Minister has said he would absolutely lead the UK out of the EU in a No Deal Brexit - but onlyneeded. He warned it would add uncertainty and it is not my preferred destination. In his first leadership interview, he said the UK should look to deliver Brexit on time - but did not to rule out a possible delay beyond October . Iaposve always said we need to be pragmatic, we need to be sensible, we need to leave with a deal, he said. Michael Gove HARD BREXIT RATING:    In his leadership announcement, Mr Gove refused to sayBritain should leave the EU, deal or no deal, in October. Instead he said there must be a proper and informed debate about the options Britain faces. When it comes to No Deal, he said we would be able to get through it but it is better to secure a deal. The Leave-voting Environment Secretary was a Theresa May loyalist and urged MPs to pass her deal. Now Mr Gove is posing as a self-styled unity candidate to unite the Conservative Party, deliver Brexit and lead this great country. Meanwhile he has offered to introduce free UK citizenship for more than million EU citizens living here who would,they stay, eventually become eligible. That would waive the current £, naturalisation fee - though Commonwealth citizens in the UK would still have to pay. Matt Hancock HARD BREXIT RATING: .   The Remain-voting Health Secretary said itaposs mission critical to deliver Brexit before a general election. But the next election is only due in . So that implies he could accept another extension to avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal on October . Heaposs said he would re-enter negotiations with the EU. And he said No Deal Brexit is not a policy choice available to the next prime minister because of the deadlock in Parliament. Mr Hancock - who chartered planes and fridges to store medicines in a no-deal - said he would have to level with people about the trade-offs. He added: I think it is much, much easier to bring people together behind a proposalyou are straightforward in advance. Jeremy Hunt HARD BREXIT RATING:    The Foreign Secretary has said pushing for No Deal Brexit would be political suicide and could make the Conservatives extinct. He added MPs could force a general election against any Prime Minister who tried - putting Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street by Christmas. The comments, in May , are the latest stage in a long run flip-flopping opinions from Mr Hunt. He voted Remain in  but later tried to appeal to Tory Brexiteers, comparing the EU to the Soviet Union and branding himself a born-again Brexiteer and insisting no deal is better than no Brexit. In reality though, few believe he will choose a course he himself has said we would regret for generations. Instead he claims the solution is to change the Withdrawal Agreement Theresa May agreed with the EU in a new round of talks. Thataposs despite the fact the EU has repeatedly said it will not reopen the -page Withdrawal Agreement, which was finished in November  and has been blocked by MPs ever since. Mr Hunt also claimed he wanted Brexiteers including the DUP and Tory hardliners to join the negotiating team. But he refused to say he would involve Nigel Farage, whose Brexit Party won a landslide in the EU elections, or Jeremy Corbyn who he accused of bad faith. Rory Stewart HARD BREXIT RATING:    The International Development Secretary is the biggest Remainer on the ticket - and has said heaposd refuse to work under a Boris Johnson government. He said No Deal will be a huge mistake, damaging, unnecessary, and dishonest that would destroy  years of reputation overnight. And he compared Boris Johnson to Pinocchio and Brexiteersapos thinking to the Wizard of Oz. Mr Stewart has met Unite chief Len McCluskey and plans citizensapos assemblies to find consensus over Brexit. He saidnecessary he would even work with Nigel Farage, adding: The whole point about this is: no red lines, talk to everyone.

He sparked fury in  by calling for the minimum wage to be scrapped.       According to the Evening Standard, he made the call during a Tory conference event hosted by the right-wing, anti-state pressure group Taxpayersapos Alliance. TPA chairman Matthew Sinclair said: “I want no explanation or justication, I want you to name a tax or a regulation that you would most like to see scrapped.” When he got to Mr Cleverly the assembly member is said to have called out: “Minimum wage.” The famously plain-speaking MP also admitted smoking cannabis and watching online porn in a radio interview shortly after becoming an MP. Today Mr Cleverly said he would absolutely lead the UK out of the EU in a No Deal Brexitneeded. But he said it would add uncertainty and it is not my preferred destination. He said the UK should look to deliver Brexit on time, but did not to rule out a possible delay beyond October . Iaposve always said we need to be pragmatic, we need to be sensible, we need to leave with a deal, he said.  He said the Tories need a leader who truly believes in the opportunity Brexit presents. He told the Braintree and Witham Times: Once Brexit is delivered, we then need to think about how we can make the Conservatives look new and sound dferent. From the politics we have seen in the last two years, it is clear it needs a complete refresh. We need a change and I believe I am the right person to deliver that change.

And senior figures said he could announce his backing within days. After the exodus of supporters to Remain parties the Lib Dems and Greens amid accusations he was sitting on the Brexit fence, the leader now looks poised to back a people’s vote within days. He has been under mounting pressure to get behind a ­referendum. And Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford, who spoke to Mr Corbyn on the phone this week, fuelled hopes of a breakthrough. He said: “He continues to get advice from a iety of dferent sources. I think the UK position is still evolving. We will hear more about it, I believe, over this week.”    Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, added: “We’re supporting a people’s vote strongly now because it’s the right thing to do and it’s democratic. “There is no inherent contradiction between respecting the result of the referendum and having a people’s vote, not least because it’s still not sure how a people’s vote would pan out.” A senior Shadow Cabinet minister said: “We need to be more definitive quickly and you’ll see that in the next couple of days, to give our membership confidence again that they can get back on the doorstep, because they couldn’t this time round.”  Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson urged his boss to “show some humility, to listen and to move very, very quickly”. Labour won just .% of the vote and  seats at last week’s EU elections, compared with .% and  seats for the Lib Dems and .% and seven seats for the Greens. Both of those jubilant parties support a second referendum. The Tories got a miserly .% of the vote, winning just four seats.    ButMr Corbyn does back a people’s vote, he risks losing Labour Leavers to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, which triumphed at the elections. Lisa Nandy, MP for Wigan, said: “There is a huge frustration amongst Labour voters who voted Leave in towns like mine to see leading figures from Labour calling for a second referendum before there’s been any serious attempt to implement the result of the first. “I strongly suspectthere is a second referendum people here would come out and vote in fairly large numbers and probably vote for no-deal.”  Labour Leave general secretary Brendan Chilton added: “We performed horrically across North England and fell to a historically unprecedented third place in Wales. “The Brexit Party topped the polls across these regions, and indeed across much of the UK. “We are being too ambiguous in our policy and, to many of our traditional supporters, we are reneging on our manesto commitment to leave the EU in .” Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott , a key ally of Mr Corbyn, indicated a change from the top was close. She said: “We’re supporting a People’s Vote strongly now because it’s the right thing to do and it’s the democratic thing to do.” Insisting the party was “foregrounding” a second referendum, she added: “There is no inherent contradiction between respecting the result of the referendum and having a People’s Vote, not least because it’s still not sure how a People’s Vote would pan out.” She went on: “Our position is that ideally we want a general election -we can’t get a general election in time, we would support a People’s Vote.”  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he voted Labour “without great enthusiasm” last week as he stepped up demands for the party to support another referendum. He said Mr Corbyn “has got to come to a clear position”, telling Sky News: “The one that is very obvious is that both party leaderships have made the same mistake, which is to think that it’s possible to sit on the fence on Europe and appeal to both sides. “What the European elections show you is that isn’t possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"next conservative leader odds runners","story":"NewsNext Tory leader odds: Profiles of candidates to be UKs next Prime MinisterThe Conservative leadership contest is fast resembling the Grand National as MPs battle it out to replace Theresa May.

At least  MPs have already chucked their hats in the ring to replace her in a contest dominated by Brexit. By the end of July we could have a hard Brexiteer Prime Minister who wants to crash the UK out with no deal. Or it could be a more moderate candidate, a continuity May option of entering yet more negotiations with the EU. So who is bidding to replace Theresa May  Hereaposs a full rundown of the candidates with profiles, odds and how much of a True Blue Tory Warrior™ they are. Or click here to see where they all stand on Brexit.  Unlike Mrs Mayaposs election in , where Tory members never voted, this race promises to be the most bruising in years. And just like her election, it will have profound consequences for Brexit - with a hard-right, Hard Leaver likely to take the reins. Under the rules of a Tory leadership race, candidates bidding for the crown must be nominated by two or more fellow Tory MPs. A series of knockout ballots is then held among MPs to whittle down the wide field of candidates to just two.  Those two preferred candidates go to a run-off of the wider Conservative Party, with its , members eligible to vote. The candidate who wins the most votes becomes the leader.  All the Tory leadership contenders Declared openly that they will run Odds retrieved from Paddy Power, May Boris Johnson -   Dominic Raab -   Michael Gove -   Andrea Leadsom -   Jeremy Hunt -   Rory Stewart -   Sajid Javid -   Matt Hancock -   James Cleverly -   Esther McVey -   Kit Malthouse - not listed on Paddy PowerReported, hinted - or refused to rule outSteve Baker Graham Brady   James Cleverly Penny Mordaunt  Mark Harper David Gauke James BrokenshireLeading Tories who WONaposT be runningAmber Rudd Liz Truss Justine Greening David Lidington Jacob Rees-Mogg Johnny Mercer Tobias Ellwood David Davis Victoria Atkins Ken Clarke Dominic Grieve Tom Tugendhat    Profiles of the candidates Boris Johnson  VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    Brexiteer and former foreign secretary Mr Johnson, , has been a leading voice against Theresa Mayaposs Brexit plan - and heaposs been preparing for this for years. The Old Etonian was one of the key players in the  Leave campaign after a last-minute decision to back Brexit. He resigned from the Cabinet in  in protest at Mayaposs plan. He was tipped as a successor to David Cameron but ruled himself out after Michael Gove stabbed him in the back with a last-minute bid for the top job. Since then heaposs lost weight and had a haircut in what many argued was a pre-leadership bid upgrade. Sure enough he confirmed by telling a business conference: Iaposm going to go for it! Selecting the former mayor of London for eight years would enrage Tory Remainers, who believe he is in this game only for himself and his ego. He became notorious for his attention-grabbing offensive comments, when he called black people piccaninnies, said Barack Obama was part-Kenyan and compared the EU to Adolf Hitler. Heaposs also criticised for vast sums of money he rakes in alongside being an MP for speeches and a £,-a-yearcolumn - which was rapped for inaccuracy by the press regulator. Meanwhile, heaposs been rapped for showing a lack of respect to Parliament by repeatedly breaking Commons rules. Supporters say that since splitting with his long-suffering we Marina Wheeler and shacking up with ex-Tory head of press Carrie Symonds, heaposs mended his ways and become more serious. But scores of Tory MPs would vote for Anyone But Boris and a Scottish operation to stop him was nicknamed Operation Arse. Dominic Raab  VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING: .   During his four-month stint as Brexit Secretary, ultra-hard Leaver Dominic Raab suggested he would use leaving the EU to slash business taxes. Now heaposs running for leader heaposs hinted p could be slashed off income tax - cutting billions from the public purse. And that wasnapost all that would anger left-wingers. The -year-old sparked fury in  by saying most food bank users are not languishing in poverty. He claimed: The typical user... is someone who has a cash flow problem. When a disability activist told him people are dying under Tory austerity, he described her calls for cash as a childish wish list. And he put out a pamphlet in  that suggested exempting small firms from minimum wage laws for workers under . Mr Raab positioned himself early on for the leadership, setting out his plans to tackle kne crime with “robust policing” and community work. He also paraded in his home in a cringeworthy interview with his we. And he attempted to outflank hostile competition by addressing claims he used a gagging order, to silence a former colleague who accused him of bullying. Mr Raab told The Sunday Times the claims, which date back to  before he was an MP, were completely ”. Michael Gove  VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Environment Secretary had a bruising experience in the last Tory leadership race stabbing Boris in the back before finishing third. And he kept his powder dry in the days immediately following Theresa Mayaposs announcement she would quit. But behind the scenes his allies, including Treasury minister Mel Stride, have been approaching MPs in the most unlikely positions to seethey will join his slate. One former Cabinet minister told the Mirror Mr Gove was one of the most likely to be elected. Despite infuriating teachers when he was Education Secretary, and stabbing Boris Johnson in the back for leadership in , the -year-old is seen as a competent media performer and has won plaudits as a campaigner for environmental issues. He has already paraded with his Scottish parents as part of the proxy leadership contest in the party. He was a prominent face in the Brexit campaign, but he isnapost wildly trusted by other figures on the Conservativesapos eurosceptic wing.    Jeremy Hunt  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was a prominent Remainer in the  referendum. And despite a sht towards Eurosceptic views heaposs now even more prominent - warning deliberately causing No Deal would be political suicide and put Corbyn in No. Mr Hunt has marked himself out as the more moderate candidate against hard Brexiteers but could risk being seen as the continuity candidate for Theresa May. As Health Secretary, Mr Hunt, , fought a long battle with the medical profession over a new contract for doctorsapos working conditions. The -year-old became Foreign Secretary in July following the resignation of Boris Johnson. He chose not to run in the  leadership contest and instead gave his full support to Mrs May, saying it was not the right time to put his hat in the ring.    Andrea Leadsom  VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old, grammar-school educated former bank executive is about as true blue Tory as you can get. She survived to the final two of the  Tory leadership race, pitching herself as the Hard Brexit, blue alternative to Theresa May with a cringeworthy march in Westminster. But she infamously pulled out after making controversial remarks about motherhood and trying to deny them. She was loyal in public for two years of Cabinet office while furiously working to push towards a harder Brexit in private, through the pizza club of Tory ministers. She played a crucial part in forcing Theresa Mayaposs resignation announcement, resigning from the PMaposs cabinet and blasting her plan hours before the EU elections.    Rory Stewart  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Hong Kong-born son of a diplomat, an Old Etonian, once admitted his career gives the appearance he was a spy. The -year-old delivered his own child after a career as a diplomat in the Foreign Office. He was elected MP for Penrith and the Border in  and joined the government in . The International Development Secretary wasted no time after being promoted to the Cabinet in May . He announced his pitch to be PM within hours. He has since travelled to Leave-voting areas such as Barking to put himself out in the faces of the public. Yet his approach - blindly following the PMaposs Brexit deal and saying it might even be worth splitting the party for - has made him wildly unpopular among Tory Brexiteers.    Sajid Javid   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:       It’s widely expected the next Tory leader will be a Brexiteer. That means Mr Javid, , who backed Reman but now supports Leave, would have a real fight on his hands to win round Tory members. He took over at the Home Office after Amber Rudd was forced to quit over the Windrush scandal - and has picked public fights with Mrs May on key issues like immigration and police funding. But his star has fallen over chaotic handling of migrants crossing the Channel. He was accused of stoking tensions by declaring a national emergency to deal with a few hundred migrant crossings over a period of months. Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani bus driver, would be the first non-white Prime Minister. Matt Hancock  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING: .     The ambitious -year-old entered politics as George Osborneaposs adviser and was in the inner circle of the famously cliquey ex-Chancellor. The parkour- and karaoke-loving Conservative entered Parliament in , Government in  and joined the DCMS in July  after Mrs May took over as Prime Minister. He was swtly promoted to Culture Secretary and then Health Secretary. But he came under fire for accepting thousands from the boss of a think tank which wants to scrap the NHS. Within days of the PMaposs announcement, he somehow found his way onto the Good Morning Britain sofa, where he said of leadership: I think you don’t rule out these things.” Laying out his policy stall beyond Brexit he said he wants to make Britain a high-tech economy exporting to the global middle class. And he said the UK needs to drive up the minimum wage at the same time as slashing tax. Esther McVey    VOTED: Leave  TRUE BLUE RATING:   The hardline Brexiteer confirmed she will be running for the Tory leadership with a pledge to slash £billion from foreign aid, and spend it on schools and the police. The former welfare-slasher and rank outsider said: Iaposve always said quite clearlyI got enough support from colleagues then yes I would, and now people have come forward and I have got that support. But former GMTV presenter Ms McVey became notorious among benefit claimants after working as a Minister and later Secretary of State in the Department for Work and Pensions. Her blunt style drew floods of criticism even when she managed to secure limited extra money for cash-starved Universal Credit, and U-turned on a benefit cut for the disabled.  Over the years, she made a number of controversial comments which turned her into a lightning rod for anger about benefits. She was ousted from her Wirral West seat in  after a sustained campaign against her, but ed in George Osborneaposs ultra-safe Tatton seat in . She made clear that under her leadership Britain would leave the EU on October  - deal or no deal. Kit Malthouse    VOTED: Leave    TRUE BLUE RATING:   The former Deputy Mayor of London under Boris Johnson threw his hat in the ring, clearly deciding he could do a better job. The -year-old was an accountant before joining Tory politics and winning the safe seat of North West Hampshire in . He quickly rose through the ranks, joining the DWP as a junior minister before being made Housing Minister where he had the tough task of dealing with fallout from the Grenfell Tower disaster. He ingratiated himself with Brexit-backing MPs by devising the aposMalthouse compromiseapos - a plan for high-tech border checks and other features to solve the Irish border issue. Critics say the plan is unworkable. He openly admitted making le uncomfortable for the homeless as part of a zero-tolerance crackdown when he was on Westminster City Council. Under his watch, the council was accused by one London Assembly member of adopting a ruthless policy towards homeless people that included hosing them out of doorways. Asked in he was behind such a hosing policy, Mr Malthouse replied: We certainly instituted a policy of making le - it sounds counterintuitive and cruel - more uncomfortable that is absolutely right. James Cleverly  VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    James Cleverly only won his seat in  but claimed he could deliver the change the country needs after the failed reign of Theresa May . Despite being a fierce defender of the PM until she resigned, the -year-old Brexit Minister admitted: She didnapost fit well with the role of Prime Minister. The Braintree MP and former Territorial Army Major would become the first PM from an ethnic minority backgroundhe was elected. He served on the London Assembly from  before joining Parliament and rising to a Tory Vice Chairman and Brexit Minister. He sparked fury in  by calling for the minimum wage to be scrapped. According to the Evening Standard, he made the call during a Tory conference event hosted by the right-wing, anti-state pressure group Taxpayersapos Alliance. The famously plain-speaking MP also admitted smoking cannabis and watching online porn in a radio interview shortly after becoming an MP. Today Mr Cleverly said he would absolutely lead the UK out of the EU in a No Deal Brexitneeded. But he said it is not my preferred destination and appeared not to rule out a possible delay beyond October . Still uncleartheyaposll run Penny Mordaunt  VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    Recently promoted to Defence Secretary, Penny Mordaunt is a -year-old Royal Navy reservist whoaposs only been an MP since  - but has a rich slew of headlines to her name. From bellyflopping on TV ing show Splash! to slashing billions off benefits and lying about Brexit, sheaposs often been famous - and only sometimes for the right reasons. The daughter of a paratrooper and special needs teacher, who has a twin brother, the Portsmouth North MP went to her local comprehensive. She worked in a factory and as a magicianaposs assistant to save up for Reading University, which she was the first member of her family to go to. The PR supremo was director of communications for the National Lottery, head of campaigns for Diabetes UK, head of foreign press for George W Bush’s  and  election campaigns and chief of staff for former MP David Willetts.    Graham Brady VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old, made a Sir in , holds Theresa Mayaposs fate in his hands as chairman of the  Committee. The august body runs leadership challenges in the Conservative Party and could change the rules to force Mrs May out. Heaposs currently its premier diplomat in the Tory war, but could reportedly sacrice his immunity to run for the top job himself. The grammar-school-educated MP for Altrincham and Sale West is a former PR man who turned MP in  and was the chief aide to former Tory leader Michael Howard. David Gauke  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The pro-Remain Justice Secretary is highly unlikely to be putting his hat in the ring. But there is some suggested he could team up with fellow Remainer Amber Rudd to run on a joint ticket. He also gave a wide-ranging speech on Thursday  May straying beyond the confines of his brief. Mr Gauke took a swipe at populists like Boris Johnson saying: Populism would undermine the United Kingdom.  In the context of the United Kingdom, right-wing populism means English nationalism. The biggest problem with populist policies is that too often, they’re just plain wrong. Big hitters who ruled themselves out Amber Rudd VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    Amber Rudd was previously seen as a favourite to replace Mrs May. But as the party has drted to the right the moderate Remainer Ms Rudd had fallen out of favour. She was forced to quit as Home Secretary during the Windrush scandal. But after eurosceptic Esther McVey quit the government, remain-supporting Ms Rudd, , ed to government as Work and Pensions Secretary. She has a tiny majority in her seat of Hastings and Rye, which would make her vulnerable to any co-ordinated insurgency from local Labour backers. The Work and Pensions Secretary gave a wide-ranging speech on  May that called for a st Century approach to work in what many will see as a pitch for the Tory leadership. She said I hope a softening of benefit sanctions show her credentials as a so-called aposOne Nationapos Tory. And she admitted sanctions may have damaged the Tory brand, saying: If there has been damage I hope we can reverse that.  She dodged questions on whether she would throw her hat in the ring for the Tory leadership, saying: “I’m committed to the DWP”. But she later pulled out accepting the Tory party would want someone fully behind Brexit. Liz Truss  VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Chief Secretary of the Treasury is about as right wing as they come when it comes to economics. The -year-old also loves to tell a joke and hasnapost really hidden her ambition to one day hold the top job. She even posed in Westminster for a photo shoot and an interview with the Sunday Times, calling for £bn to be spent on tax cuts. And she appeared in a series of hair-raising photos with wide-bottomed trousers before giving a speech that ranged far beyond her brief. But disappointing performances in high profile jobs like her time a Justice Secretary left some MPs questioningshe has what it takes for the top job. She voted to Remain in the referendum - and since said she would change her mind and became a born-again Brexiteer. But she dropped out saying the leader had to be someone who voted Leave in .

Now in his late s, he said he has suffered PTSD, lost his job and marriage and even tried to end his le. He claimed he has yet to receive any compensation. He said: “This isn’t close to being justice for the victims. It’s been handled in the most callous way, just so they portray that it’s all over and done with.”  City launched the scheme this year for people abused by Bennell and now-dead John Broome who both coached youth teams connected to the club.City say it is a “quicker and more cost-effective alternative” to court action, and they want to “do the right thing”. They also believe it gives more generous payments than could be obtained by civil action. Of around  victims who have contacted the scheme, all but one has signed up rather than launch a separate legal claim, bosses said. It pays out between £, and £, for sexual assault, depending on the severity and time span of the offences. For example, touching under clothes would be compensated with £,. Additional damages of up to £, can be paid for claims of “disadvantage in the labour market”. It compares with the government’s Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, under which child sex abuse victims can get £, to £,. City’s initiative was praised last week by MP Damian Collins, chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee.  But the victim, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Daily Record: “Bennell must have touched me in an inappropriate way over a thousands times over a year. Does it mean I could get £, for each of those incidents  “They said I could get a flat payment of £, for potential loss of earnings. I could’ve been earning that in a week playing for a big club. I appreciate they made an effort to deal with the past but there must be a better way. It’s time people like me got what they’re owed.” Bennell, , also linked with Crewe Alexandra, was jailed for  years last year for attacks on  boys between  and . Last week ex-football coach Bob Higgins, , was found guilty of indecent assault against boys, mostly trainees at Southampton FC and Peterborough Utd, between  and .Mr Collins urged Southampton to follow Manchester City’s lead on payouts. A City spokesman said: “[Our] review into historic child sex abuse and the resulting Survivor Compensation scheme is the result of more than two years of exhaustive research and engagement with a large number experts in the field.The scheme, which is the first of its kind in football, is designed to offer survivors an alternative – with absolutely no obligation – to civil litigation, a process which can often be y, costly and combative for survivors. “The Scheme was created voluntarily by the club and has been well received by stakeholders, not least by law firms with particular experience in this field.” "},{"url":null,"title":"british hostage keeper reveals horrific","story":"NewsBritish hostage-keeper reveals extent of his horric role within Islamic StateAlexanda Kotey has admitted to extracting information from western hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning who was beheaded by Jihadi John in ShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsBritish hostage-keeper Alexanda Kotey reveals to ITV News his role in so-called Islamic State \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British ISIS hostage-keeper has admitted that he plotted to kill soldiers and police in terror attacks on UK soil.

Kemi was arrested in May last year on suspicion of trying to kill Meghan after the younger woman started dating her ex Andrew Coaker, , from Reading. The incident occurred outside flats in Federico Garcia Lorca Street near Magaluf’s brash Punta Ballena area. She was arrested half an hour after the May   incident in the nearby resort of Cala Vinyes.    The victim’s injuries were initially described as serious and she took three weeks to recover from leg wounds which required surgery. The judge handed her a two-year suspended jail sentence for a crime of wounding with a dangerous weapon as well as a three-year restraining order which prevents her from going within  metres of her victim A second woman - who was in the hire car with Kemi and is believed to be a relative of Kemi’s although it was not confirmed at the time by officials - was told she will not face any court action.

A spokesman for the Civil Guard said in a statement at the time: “Officers assisted a a group of people in Magaluf who were around a woman they spotted lying on the ground. “That woman was an injured British national. They added: “Witnesses said a car had run her over before speeding away from the scene. One of the witnesses said the car had mounted the pavement intent on running over the woman. “Officers were told the vehicle was a small, white car and police patrols were alerted. “Thirty minutes later a Civil Guard patrol searching for the vehicle in Cala Vinyes spotted a suspect car with two young women inside whose descriptions matched those of the people they were looking for. Coaker claimed after her arrest that her victim would taunt her whenever they crossed paths in Magaluf and insisted she only wanted to scare her when she drove at her. She learnt her fate at a criminal court in the Majorcan capital Palma. Kemi was thought to have been using her married name rather than her maiden name Pereira at the time of the incident. It later emerged she was the sister of a jailed drugs dealer. John Pereira, , was jailed in  for five years and six months after cocaine worth £ was found at his home in Majorca. Reports at the time said he had violence and drugs convictions in the UK and would be sent back to Britain after serving his time in Majorca because he was wanted for breaching the terms of his licence following his release from prison. Kemi and Andrew split in . Bar worker Meghan is thought to have been dating the Reading-born expat for around three months when she was mowed down.

Mr Lyndsay, who was on holiday to celebrate his th wedding anniversary with we Elizabeth, needs an air ambulance to fly home for further treatment in hospital.But the -year-old is still in Portugal and has been shunned by insurance firm Mapfre Assistance despite having more than £million of comprehensive medical cover, his daughter told the Daily Record.   Mr Lyndsay has been in hospital for almost a month and his health is deteriorating, his daughter Tracey White, , said. Ms White, from Sauchie, Clackmannanshire, said: “With each day that passes, dad’s health is getting worse. He has been abandoned, despite being fully insured. “His policy covers the costs of repatriation and we can’t understand why there’s no sign of the company flying him home.  They are dragging their feet, despite having all the relevant paperwork.” Ms White claims the family are being stonewalled by Mapfre Assistance as they demand to know when Mr Lyndsay will be flown home. She added: “It’s disgusting the way we are being treated. “There’s nothing more doctors can do but it seems like the firm are trying to buy time to find a way out of paying for the private transportation to bring dad home to Scotland.  “He isn’t well enough for a commercial flight – he can’t move his body because of the nature of the injuries he has suffered. “He’s lucky to be alive and desperately wants home so doctors can assess what needs done and operate. “We are at the hospital every day and hate going home at night. Dad’s barely eating and is staring at the ceiling all day. “He’s now got an infection and I’m worried he’ll get worse. It’s heartbreaking seeing him so low.” Ms White said the family cannot arrange for an air ambulance until Mapfre Assistance covers the costs.  She added: “Every time I call, I’m fobbed off with excuses. I can’t get a straight answer and I’m exhausted with it all. “The way they have treated dad is nothing short of disgraceful.” Mr Lyndsay and his -year-old we were celebrating their wedding anniversary on May  when he was hit by the van. His daughter said: “My parents come here every year for their anniversary and they know the area well. “Dad was going back to the hotel to get ready to go out for a meal and he was about three steps on to the zebra crossing when the van hit him. “He was knocked over and couldn’t move. He was rushed to an emergency medical centre before being transferred to hospital.”has attempted to contact Mapfre Assistance for comment.

Graeme Heward saw doctors for months about his eye issues and pressure in his sinus which they believed to be Dry Eye and a blocked tear duct. But Graame actually had an alien growing in his face. The -year-old was finally diagnosed with cancer of the nasal lining in  - after suffering with his symptoms for almost eight months. He quickly dubbed the a large tumour The Alien - with the subsequent treatments causing signicant damage to his face.Graeme told the Liverpool ECHO : I wasnapost feeling unwell and I didnapost suffer any weight loss, it all started with the watery eye.When the tumour was discovered, I could actually see the mass up my nose, but doctors originally believed it was benign. Later hearing the tumour was cancer was devastating.    Graeme began calling his tumour The Alien because he struggled to say that he had cancer. He said: It was too painful to admit I had cancer. I was embarrassed for some reason, so I called it The Alien. It was unwanted and unwelcome and it invaded my le. Since his diagnosis Graeme has undergone almost  surgeries, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which cost him his right eye and left him struggling to breathe - as the photo below shows. To cover the hole in his face, Graeme has skin and muscle grafted from his thigh before having a prosthetic eye fitted in  and then a prosthetic nose, meaning he can now breathe properly again without pain and even wear his glasses. Eventually two years ago Graeme’s treatment options were reduced to palliative chemotherapy only. Graeme realised that he would die quickerhe didnapost make drastic changes to his le.    Talking about the changes he made, the father-of-two, who works as a physio, said: When I started looking into what I could do, I discovered around  changes I could make to my le to keep myself healthy. I changed my diet, reduced stress in my le, limited my exposure to chemicals, to name just a few. I have always been fit and healthy as I work as a physiotherapist but Iaposve never been as healthy as I am now. The changes Graeme made coincided with the opening of Maggie’s centre in Manchester where Graeme has been receiving help through their facilities.  Graeme told the ECHO: The ethos of these centres is perhaps best summed up in a quote from their founder Maggie Keswick Jones ‘Above all what matters is not to lose the joy of living in the fear of dying’ which is a concept I now embody in my daily le. And despite being placed on palliative care, Graeme has just begun a , mile bike ride to raise money for the centres that gave him back the joy of living. Having already raised almost £,, Graeme says that part of the ride is also to raise awareness of the centres. He said: I am surrounded by incredible people who have helped me go through this, including my amazing partner Leslie.  But I have also received so much support from Maggieaposs and I just want to help them in any way I can. A lot of people donapost know what Maggieaposs is and hopefully they will never need to use their services but I just want to help them in any way I can. Graeme will spend the next two weeks cycling from Swansea to Inverness, stopping at each Maggieaposs Centre on his way across the country.

Lena Holdsworth says she begged doctors to act after she spotted symptoms of the infection two days after delivering her child, Harry, in . However, the -year-old mum, from County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, claims it took doctors six days to operate on her - by which time her skin had turned black and purple.Following the op, Lena has been left with no stomach muscles and her organs are ‘hanging out’ of her abdomen due to what she says was ‘negligence’ on behalf of the Southern Trust, Belfast Live reports.   She has now developed a potentially le-threatening hernia in her abdomen, however doctors told her last week that they could not tackle the growth. The mumaposs health problems started when she was  weeks pregnant with Harry and went to the hospital with pains. She was examined by a doctor who told her she was dilated -cm and was being transferred to Ulster Hospital as there were no neo-natal beds available.The  Coalisland  mum was then examined by another doctor who told her she had been examined wrong and wasn’t in labour. She was kept in for two days but during that time her grandmother passed away and she was discharged to attend her funeral but her condition took a turn for the worse.She said: “I was barely fit to get out of bed, but I managed to get into the car but I spent the whole funeral sitting in the car vomiting. I got worse as the day went on and was taken by ambulance to hospital that night. After around seven days of being on drips, Lena was about to be discharged but one final scan revealed the fluid around the baby had reduced, his growth had slowed down and he was lying transverse so she was booked for an elective section. She explained: “I was ready to go when two consultants came in and said they would do a last minute scan. They did and the baby had turned, he was head down so they said they wouldn’t do the section, instead they would break my waters and send me round to the delivery room. “The last thing I wanted was a section because I had four normal deliveries prior to that but with being so ill, I knew that I wasn’t physically fit for labour. I couldn’t even lt my head to vomit and even the midwives were saying ‘this girl hasn’t been well’ but they went ahead anyway.” It wasn’t until her natural labour got progressively worse that Lena was rushed for C-section and to her amazement woke up in recovery ‘nearly pain free’ and was told she had a beautul baby. Lena visited Harry in the neo-natal ward and ‘slept well’ that night relieved everything was OK, but the next morning the pain ed. She said: “I woke up and the pain took my breath away. The nurses were saying it’s just your section wound but I had no pain around my section wound, it was all much higher up.” The mum said she got worse over the next couple of days and alerted midwives to a lump under her skin to the right of her belly button. After being examined by a doctor she was told they couldn’t find anything and was ‘just tender’ from what had happened.    She added: “I was crying and roaring and maybe by the third or fourth day I was delirious, I couldn’t get out of bed to go to the toilet, I couldn’t eat or drink, couldn’t move. But even after I told them I felt that something had burst, the consultants were saying it was a secondary infection and with antibiotics it would be fine. “It wasn’t until the morning of November , six days after I first found the lump and told them, that they asked me where my family where and how long it would take them to get there. They told me they had to send me for emergency surgery, as my skin was black and purple, and that I had a flesh-eating bug known as Necrotizing Fasciitis. “They told methey waited I would die and that there was no guarantee I would make it out of theatre. They had rang the family and took Harry around from the neo-natal unit so I could kiss him, and I was rushed into surgery before my family even arrived. “They prepared Shane my partner and my family for the worst and I was given the last rites in intensive care.” Against all the odds, Lena woke up days later in intensive care having been placed in an induced coma following surgery over two days. She said: “From a cm lump that it started out as, they left it that long they had to remove cm of my stomach. It was an open wound, cm down and cm deep, it had to be packed every day with pipes and foam and a vac machine put on and I was in agony. I kept asking aposwhy, how did this happen apos But I wasn’t getting any answers, I was just told it was an infection. “All I kept saying was I had told them for so long that something wasn’t right but nobody listened to me. I had my medical notes and according to them on November , four days before I had the surgery, it says on my notes from the microbiologist several times to monitor for Necrotising Fasciitis. Following surgery, Lena has been left with no stomach muscles and says her organs are just being held in by her skin. After finding another lump lower down on her abdomen months after the surgery, she said she was told it was just a hernia, but says it kept getting bigger. Lena added: “I was sent for several CT scans over the last two and a half years and I was told all of my organs - my stomach, my bowel, my intestines - have fallen to one lump at the left hand side of my body. It is all tangled and that’s all as a result of the surgery I had after Harry was born. “I am in agony, I can hardly walk, I’ve no quality of le, I can’t do anything with my children. They told me they would operate when I was fit enough and when I lost two three stone and in total I’ve lost over six. “This has been nearly  years and it’s getting worse.” Having been told in March they would perform the complicated surgery, Lena was left devastated last week when they told her there was nothing they could do. She said: “I was in disbelief. He said we will call you back in three months but it’s only to sign consent papers becauseanything happens you, we will not be held responsible,we do this op you will die. “So I said you’re going to leave me with my stomach actually hitting my thighs  And he said well I would advise you to stop in Marks  Spencers on your way home and buy a corset.” She added: “A hernia can get strangulated, it can get blocked, it can cause blockages in your bowel, so have I been sent home more or less with a death sentence  “Are they just going to say sorry there’s nothing we can do and leave me to die  It’s not even a matter , it’s a matter of when things go bad. Lena is hoping someone, somewhere will be able to help her and said only for her five children relying on her, she wouldn’t be fit to get up every day, adding: “I couldn’t complain about the treatment I got in the maternity ward, it was all the consultants and the top doctors that let me down. A spokesperson for the Southern Trust said: “Whilst we are unable to publicly discuss any inidual case, we take all concerns about the quality of our care very seriously and have been in correspondence with Ms Holdsworth in relation to her circumstances.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rich must pay fare share","story":"NewsopinionRich must pay their fair share and not hide it away in tax havensThe rich should be funding the NHS, paying to improve schools and raising the living standards of allShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionNotorious tax haven Bermuda \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWe are letting the super-rich exploit us when Britain is at the centre of a £billion tax haven spider’s web.

Party crashing The fallout from the European Parliament elections continues at pace. The Tory Party remains just as terried of Nigel Farage as it was when David Cameron promised the Brexit referendum in the first place – a devious tail wagging the dog.    Leadership contenders on the party’s right are now pushing a damaging no-deal Brexit. Such talk is reckless but parliament has, so far, thankfully remained firm in its opposition. Meanwhile Labour is also licking its wounds, with senior figures convinced that Jeremy Corbyn will finally back a second referendum. It is a move that must now be inevitable given the number of votes the party lost to the Lib Dems and Greens.

The UK will be among the chilliest countries in Europe on Wednesday with highs around C in the north and just C in the south.But there will be a dramatic sht from Thursday as it begins to feel increasingly warm and humid - with the Met Office predicting C on Saturday - the first day of June - and possibly C on Sunday.It will be a sizzling weekend in central and southern parts of the UK, especially in the south-east corner, where Norwich and London could be among the hottest places, according to forecasters.    Temperatures plunged to -.C in Tulloch Bridge in the Scottish Highlands as there was widespread air frost in Scotland overnight. The Met Office said at least  of its observation sites in Scotland fell below freezing. Drivers were contending with fog during the morning commute in parts of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Wednesday got off to a bright start in many central and eastern areas, but cloud and rain will arrive from the west as temperatures remain around the mid teens across the country.  The Met Office said heavy rain will fall over western hills and it will become breezier in the afternoon. It will be mild overnight as rain continues in the north and the south stays mostly dry. Thursday will feel warn and humid in the south with highs of C, but temperatures in the north will stay in the mid teens with outbreaks of rain.Friday will bring similar conditions before the weather becomes increasingly warm and humid at the weekend. Saturday - the first day of June - and Sunday are expected to be very warm in the south-east. Highs of C on Saturday and possibly C on Sunday are expected, said Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge. He said the likely candidates are places such as Norwich and north London. He added: So Sunday looks very much as though itaposs going to be a warmer day than Saturday. So we have got that warmth coming through.  Once this warm front, and the air behind it, starts to pull across the UK then we will see temperatures starting to rise. There will be rain at times in the north and west, and Sunday will bring a risk of thunderstorms in England and Wales. UK temperatures are set to be higher than holiday hot spots Barcelona, Ibiza and Saint- Tropez. But it appears it will be short-lived, with cooler temperatures and stormy conditions likely next week.  The Met Office said: Cooler fresher conditions already in the northwest will spread south-east to most,not all parts by Monday. During next week, cooler, changeable conditions are likely across the UK, especially the northwest. However, periods of wet and sometimes windy weather are likely to affect many areas, with occasional heavy, thundery showers possible anywhere during this period. Temperatures for June will be near normal or warm overall for the time of year, warmest conditions most likely in the south-east, the Met Office added.

The  second clip - entitled heartless words and released by The Heart Foundation on Sunday - uses shock tactics by suggesting people who neglect their heart health donapost love their families. But it has reduced many to tears and the Australian organisation has been hit with a barrage of criticism from grieving relatives of those who have lost loved ones to heart related illnesses. Dee Madigan wrote: Imagine how a child who has lost a parent to heart disease feels when they see an ad that literally tells them thattheir parent had loved them they would have looked after their heart. This ad is not just stupid, it is dangerous.    The advert begins with a mum tucking her son into bed and telling him: Every time I told you I loved you I was lying. You are not my priority. It then shows a couple washing the dishes together before the man turns to his partner and says: I promised you my heart, but Iaposve given it away. Another man can then be seen holding a glass of champagne while surrounded by his nearest and dearest. He tells them: In time this family will be filled with loss and sadness, but I wonapost care because Iaposll be gone. The clip then shows parents watching their daughter play the violin at a concert. The father says: If I really loved you both, Iaposd protect my heart to protect yours but I donapost. The final clip sees a mother on her deathbed in hospital while her daughter is perched beside her. She says: Because itaposs not just my heart I donapost care about, itaposs yours.    One of the grim scenes has since been removed from the ad but the original version still remains on the foundationaposs social media accounts. The clip was first uploaded to the charityaposs Facebook page on Sunday and has been viewed thousands of times and flooded with hundreds of comments. Bridgette Lawes commented: How dare you suggest that my father didn’t love me. How dare you suggest that a parent doesn’t love their child. This is outrageous and you should hang your heads in shame. My father had all his tests done and the medical profession let him down. He didn’t let me nor my family down. My father never would have wanted to die. He took care of himself This is not helpful, it’s indecent advertising. Bruce Wong wrote: Looks like I won’t be donating to you and your causes into the future. My grandfather died from a heart attack but it didn’t mean my grandfather didn’t love my dad and his grandchildren.    Kate Moody Mealey added: I am appalled. Devastated and at a loss that The Heart Foundation has lost THEIR heart. I suffered a SCAD heart attack whilst I was  weeks pregnant with my son. Ten years of pain, worry, and no medical answers accumulated tonight watching your pathetic excuse for an ad. There are thousands of heart disease sufferers who are NOT at fault, struggling daily with a chronic condition who would see this ad as the last straw. Take it off immediately. Shame on you. The charity has responded to some of the backlash, including a grieving brother whose sister needed a heart transplant before she died aged . The Heart Foundation replied: Firstly, weaposre very sorry to hear about your losses. We can understand that campaigns like this can trigger unhappy memories. It is not our intent to upset anyone.  We are trying to reduce the suffering caused by heart disease by raising awareness about the disease. In many cases heart disease is preventable, but this relies on early intervention. The campaign will help to avoid thousands of heart attacks, strokes and deaths, meaning many more Australian families won’t have to endure the same tragic loss as others before them.  We estimate that Heart Health Checks could prevent , heart attacks and strokes over the next five years, and , death. Some have however praised the clip, Katrina Umback commented: You have nailed it Heart Foundation. Very confronting but so, so true.    In response, the charity said: The Heart Foundation is raising awareness about heart disease, the risk factors and what we can do to identy and manage our personal risk of developing heart disease.  With this campaign, we are educating Australians on what can happen when they don’t look after their heart health. Our aim is to encourage people to see their GP for a Heart Health Check.  The campaign is a powerful reminder of what’s at stake.

In extremely rare cases this might even lead to a bleed inside the brain, causing a form of stroke. However, the doctor told the newspaper signicant memory loss was rare and said she had not seen a similar case in her -year career. Bodybuilders have been known to suffer blackouts during extremely intense workouts. The problem, known as vasovagal syncope, can be brought on by lting heavy weights.

But that is the role of design and designers – to help navigate this ever-changing world.”Bosses admit they were initially sceptical of the approach by organisers to breathe new le into the shopping complex – but have been happy to have been proved wrong.Centre manager Angus Morton said: “The festival has definitely brought more people in. Our footfall is up and we have been approached by new tenants.“It’s something completely dferent for us and I had to think about it for a long time before we agreed to it.“But it has encouraged more people to come in and I would welcome opening up the centre to other organisations who would like to do something like it.”The festival came to an end last night with Dundee’s biggest Pecha Kucha event yet at the Caird Hall, featuring quickfire presentations from people such as musician Ged Grimes and Uppertunity co-founder Darryl Gaffney du Plooy."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/05/5cebceb9500eb2.11817699.jpg ","title":"dundee look to make manager announcement after interviewing three candidates","story":"Dundee will look to finalise the appointment of their new manager in the next few days.The Dee have now interviewed at least three candidates – Jim Goodwin, James McPake and Kenny Miller – and are close to making the final decision over who should be offered the post.That could be done in the next  hours.And unless another contender emerges, it looks to be a choice between Alloa boss Goodwin and Dens youth coach McPake.Former Ross County boss Derek Adams had been in the running but ruled himself out at the weekend.He revealed he had been approached by Dundee with a view to being interviewed but declined the opportunity.Adams did not outline his reasons, other than to say the job at Dens was not one he would consider.After also missing out on the opportunity to interview Inverness Caley Thistle boss John Robertson last week, when the Highland club refused permission for him to be spoken to, the field has narrowed considerably.Dundee, though, are known to be happy with the quality of the men they have interviewed.Meanwhile, former Dens defender Darren O’Dea has agreed a move to Lowland League champions East Kilbride.The -year-old recently announced he was retiring from playing full-time football at the end of his Dundee contract.O’Dea was announced as Motherwell’s U  coach last week but the one-time Celtic player will continue to play for Kilby, who lost the pyramid play-off semi-final to eventual winners Cove Rangers.“I’ve agreed to go down and help East Kilbride. I have lived in East Kilbride for  years and they are a club I know well and they are desperate to go up into the leagues.

One thing I’m certain on is that I want to be a manager but not for a long time.“The workload of a manager is massive. Coaching the team is probably the easiest part and I can’t even do that just yet.“I am very clear that I don’t see going from playing to coaching as natural.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"one way to keep tarbert flowing","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert is about to get a new, improved sewer serving the village.Roads, however, will have to be dug up to replace existing underground pipes.

This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

revealed that the council paid the sum over the last six weeks, in order to get a former employee to sign a non-disclosure agreement.The request has also revealed that Scottish Borders Council has spent pound, of taxpayersrsquo money on so-called lsquogagging ordersrsquo since April .Non-disclosure agreements are contracts which are signed by both employee and employer, and which typically prevent staff or ex-staff from publicising certain information.That information can range from commercially sensitive details, such as innovations or company finances, to anything likely to damage an organisationrsquos reputation.Non-disclosure agreements have also infamously been used to prevent employees discussing allegations of misbehaviour, with a number of high profile cases in the UK making national headlines.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoNon-disclosure agreementsare included in ious types of agreement entered into by the council to resolve a situation.ldquoNDAs are included for the benefit of both the council and the other party parties.ldquoIt is important to note that an NDA is one part of an overall agreement to settle a dispute, and the majority of any costs will be met from within the relevant servicersquos budget.The contracts are sometimes used when employees and their organisations have reached a settlement to a dispute, such as a claim of wrongful dismissal, without going through a full employment tribunal hearing.Reacting to the payouts, Hawick and Hermitage councillor Davie Paterson said: ldquoI am a bit concerned at the use of no disclosure agreements, surely council tax payers are entitled to a full and comprehensive explanation as to why the council them ldquoThe public, quite rightly, will be asking why do the council have to pay out this money, they may be asking is there something wrong with the management at the top ldquoThe public would love to know why pound, has to be spent to keep a former employee quiet when this admin are making cuts left right and centre, but yet they can find pound, to give to former employees.However, the councilrsquos leader of the opposition, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, urged a more even-handed approach to non disclosure agreements.He said: ldquoSecrecy by a public authority is sometimes necessary, but any overuse does not reflect well on a public authority which should be committed to openness and transparency. ldquoI read of growing concern about the use of non disclosure agreements across a range of public bodies with Westminster MPrsquos, for example, calling for these to be made lsquoa thing of the pastrsquo.ldquoThat said I donrsquot currently think that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos use of these agreements is particularly out of line with their use by other Scottish local authorities. ,params: .pushldquoInformation is limited by some, for example Edinburgh and Aberdeen cities, refusing to respond to freedom of information requests for details. ldquoBut Glasgow City, who have responded to an FOI, and are a much larger local authority than the Scottish Borders, have applied non disclosure agreements more than six times as frequently as Scottish Borders Council over the last five years.ldquoI am minded, as chair of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee, to discuss with colleagues on this committee whether to suggest we should scrutinise the councilrsquos use of non disclosure agreements. ldquoThis would, of course have to be done in strict privacy, but it might allow some reassurance to the public that these

charging for toilet provision would generate an income of pound, a year.However, the total yearly income was just pound,, leading councillors to vote to consider privatisation as an option for future toilet provision.Officers have been working to identy potential third parties which could take over the network, and they have been consulting with a private company which could oversee the design and maintenance of public toilets in the Borders.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, who serves as the authorityrsquos executive member for neighbourhoods and community services, told a meeting of Scottish Borders Council on Thursday that work was ongoing.He said: ldquoOfficers continue to work with community groups across the Borders who have expressed an interest in operating this type of facility.ldquoAt the same time, officers are continuing to develop conversations around procurement options, internally, to then engage with third parties externallyldquoWe expect the outcome of that process will conclude in the latter part of this year.ldquoThis will allow members to consider which direction they may wish to take over the servicersquos future.Scottish Borders Council has also

Impressively, the Belarus fighter rose instantly, but was back on the floor by the roundrsquos end, saved from what looked like certain defeat by the bell.There was no escape for Baranchyk in round seven, however, Taylor hunting him down and connecting with shot after shot.To his credit, Baranchyk soaked up the considerable punishment he was receiving to hold his own in rounds eight and nine, before being rocked again in round  but just surviving to the bell.Knowing now he was well behind on points and that only a knockout would save him, Baranchyk emptied the tank in the final two rounds. Rather than trying to evade him, Taylor threw plenty of punches of his own, leaving the crowd gasping with concern on more than one occasion, but the Prestonpans ace stayed on his feet and knew he had

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

I believe that the current cemetery is starting to near capacity so it is important that we see the new cemetery open soon.Fellow ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell added: ldquoAs the community grows, we need to plan for more burial capacity in Prestonpans.ldquoThere are still people who want to be buried following their death, and I know that being laid to rest in the place you love is really important to people."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9708130.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"nicola-sturgeon-calls-for-new-scottish-independence-referendum-next-year","story":"Scotlands First Minister made the comments on a visit to Dublin, where she said the \"latter half\" of  would be the \"right time\" for a new poll.The SNP leader predicted victory in a second vote, with Scotland becoming \"an independent country just like Ireland\".She said: \"There will be another Scottish independence referendum and I will make a prediction today that Scotland will vote for independence and we will become an independent country just like Ireland, and the strong relationship between our two countries now will become even stronger soon.        name : ballot,target: ballot_,params:.push\"I want to see Scotland having the choice of independence within this term of the Scottish Parliament, which ends in May , so towards the latter half of next year would be when I think is the right time for that choice.\"Ms Sturgeon criticised the UK Government for treating Scotland with \"utter contempt\" over Brexit during the visit, when she met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.In contrast, she said Ireland had been shown \"solidarity and support\" by the EU.She said: \"We voted over % to remain, we have tried very hard in the wake of the UK-wide Brexit vote to find compromises and protect our interests, and we have worked hard across party lines to try to prevent the worst impact of Brexit, and we have been ignored.\"Scotland has been treated with contempt by Westminster and people are contrasting that with Ireland, that has been shown real solidarity and support from the European Union.:Glasgow backs remain parties in clear Brexit message to UK parties\"Suddenly this idea of being a small independent country in the European Union, we only have to look at Ireland to see the benefits of that and many people are having their eyes opened.\"The SNP has examined Irelands path to independence and planned to keep the pound before moving to a Scottish currency, she told journalist Dearbhail McDonald at the Royal Irish Academy.\"The proposition that my party is putting forward now is that we should follow the same path that Ireland followed when it became independent,\" she said.\"We use the pound which is our currency until such times as the economic conditions are right to move to an independent Scottish currency - its a perfectly well-trodden path.\"Ms Sturgeon said Scottish independence would strengthen the relationship between her nation and Ireland, adding her visit had \"highlighted the benefits of EU membership for Ireland\" and exactly what Scotland would miss out on \" taken out of the EU against our will\".\"Ireland is Scotlands closest international trading partner and our fth largest export market,\" she said.For all your breaking Glasgow news, click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages\"It is in the interest of both countries to ensure that we continue to work together and cooperate, not just on an economic level but also in dealing with similar challenges around political engagement.\"This is exactly why we must strengthen, not strain these bonds.\"Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said: \"The SNP went into this election pretending to voters that it was nothing to do with independence.\"Yet within hours of it being announced, Nicola Sturgeon is specically using it to argue for separation.\"Thats fraudulent behaviour from an SNP government thats meant to be running the country, not trying to break it up.\"Voters punished Nicola Sturgeon last time she abused the Brexit process for her own selfish aims.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"three-months-after-its-launch-how-strong-is-the-pulse-of-the-nations-newest-tv-channel","story":"Itrsquos a period in which the pound million channel dedicated to Scotland and Scottish content has, at times, attracted record digital audiences, won a quarter share of Scottish viewers, been the third most-watched channel in Scotland after BBC One and STV, reached more people between the ages of  and  than any other channel in Scotland, gained serious traction on social media and, in the best of its content, made good on its promise to give Scottish audiences programmes they wonrsquot see anywhere  and which deal with the issues and subjects that affect, concern and interest them .But itrsquos also a period marked by a wild iance in audience ratings , by whispered rumours of discontent and in-fighting, by a perceived lack of brand identity and by a barrage of negative headlines either questioning the need to have the channel in the first place or pouring scorn on specic programmes, such as The Nine or Catriona Shearer-fronted gameshow Wonderball.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzLaunching BBC Scotland in Glasgow in February, BBC Director-General Tony Hall outlined the aims of the channel. As he saw it, they were to celebrate Scotlandrsquos strengths in arts, comedy, science and ldquothought. To reflect the countryrsquos ersity. To allow audiences ldquoto interrogate the things that matter to them and, along the way, to ldquoreinvent public service broadcasting. BBC Scotland, he stressed, would offer space for discussion and debate alongside opportunities to ldquokick back and have fun. It would be about the country speaking to itself but also to the world. It would be local, national and global.In other words it would be a lot of things to a lot of people. Or it would try to be. So, three months after its glitzy birth and with the numbers soon to roll over to Day  of its existence, how is BBC Scotland bedding in  What do audiences think of it  And how well is it measuring up to Hallrsquos lofty claims Steve Carson, BBC Scotlandrsquos Head of Multi-Platform Commissioning, is predictably bullish about its prospects and its track record. To his mind the station is about trying to take risks, giving a  to ldquoa strong range of voices and communities and doing ldquonew things and dferent things. So far the strike rate is good, he thinks. Among the successes he points to are Getting Hitched Asian Style, a documentary series following a wedding planning company in Glasgow, the opening night screening of Nae Pasaran , and Last Breath, a drama documentary about a North Sea er stranded on the sea-bed.Identying a stand-out is ldquolike naming your favourite child, he says. ldquoBut I think Asian Weddings is something I was pleased to see hellip It was quite straightforward but it got into communities you donrsquot often see and certainly donrsquot often see in that sort of context.For an example of risk-taking that paid off he points to Sink Or Skim, which took a fond look at the World Stone Skimming Championship held annually on the isle of Easdale in the Firth of Lorn.ldquoThatrsquos not a subject many channels would have commissioned, but it was a beautully made piece and it was funny watching it go out and looking at social media because people were going lsquoI canrsquot believe theyrsquore doing something about stone skimming. Is this part of their sport portfolio rsquo. But by the end of it the same people were going lsquoThat was really goodrsquo.Sink Or Skim was a one-off but The Peoplersquos News is a weekly discussion of topical events in which ordinary Scots go in front of the camera and have their tuppence-worth on topical events. Those featured might not have the political contacts of a Laura Kuenssberg, say, but they have something just as important: context. They represent the social and political views of people in a spread of communities distant from London and far removed from the Central Belt. Itrsquos another example of the channelrsquos guiding principle that BBC Scotland should be a  for discussion and debate and again itrsquos a programme that wouldnrsquot have aired anywhere .ldquoWe could have done a dferent version of this channel which would have been a lot less risky and done a lot more of what other channels do, says Carson. ldquoA Scottish version of BBC Four, for example, would have been a less risky proposition. But we already have that, so we felt it was important to try new things, go for harder to reach audiences and deliberately take risks knowing that not all of them ndash in fact many of them ndash wonrsquot pay off. Thats what wersquore about.So which risks havenrsquot paid off ldquoThatrsquos like naming your least favourite child, he says. ldquoI think the programmes that we have originated between pm and pm have had a tough time, but again our medium term strategy was not to originate as much there. The Nine has had ratings which have gone up and down, but wersquove always said thatrsquos a competitive slot. But on a digital channel ndash and wersquore already the biggest non-terrestrial channel in Scotland with a three per cent share, which is well ahead of projections ndash audiences will go up and down across the night and the week.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzIf therersquos a lightning rod for criticism, The Nine is it. An hour in , staffed by a team of presenters and journalists that numbers  ndash at least in the publicity shots ndash and fronted by Rebecca Curran and award-winning former ITN journalist Martin Geissler, itrsquos the stationrsquos flagship news programme.A lot rides on its wellbeing and it seems a little peaky. It was reported that on one day in late April viewing figures dropped to just . They picked up the following day, to , but even on April , the first day of the inquiry into the Clutha disaster, they couldnrsquot quite hit . From a first night high of ,, thatrsquos a signicant drop.ldquoThe Ninersquos average is signicantly higher than that figure and its reach, which is really important in news, is reaching a quarter of a million a week, Carson counters. ldquoItrsquos offering something dferent. If you wanted to point at a show which is something we wouldnrsquot have otherwise done, The Nine is it ndash an hour long news and analysis programme which looks at Scotland, the UK and the world through Scottish eyes.So is it simply the right show but in the wrong time slot ldquoWersquoll see. Nine orsquoclock is a competitive slot but there is a demand there and people are turning to it. The appreciation for The Nine is very strong and wersquore finding that across the board. You might get some programmes that donrsquot have huge average audiences but the appreciation is strong.In a front page story earlier this month, London-based broadsheet the Sunday Times quoted a BBC source who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. The same source added: ldquoYou canrsquot have a channel that nobody watches. Journalists like their output to be watched and it wonrsquot be long until some of the channelrsquos main talent head for the door. Another source spoke of a ldquopoisonous atmosphere in the newsroom causing behind-the-scenes tensions which could cause key staff to walk. True or   ldquoThat is not the case, Carson says bluntly.Among the keenest watchers of how BBC Scotland has fared over these first three months is Dr Lisa Kelly, a lecturer in television at Glasgow University.ldquoIrsquove been pleasantly surprised, she says. ldquoI think I probably wasnrsquot holding out much hope at the beginning, primarily due to the budget ndash pound million for programming isnrsquot much to play with in the television landscape.To put the budget in context, the BBC is spending nearly three times that amount on the new EastEnders set. But funding aside, Kelly is excited by the apparent focus on nurturing and showcasing new talent. Shersquos also impressed by the choice of programmes and pleasantly surprised at the internationalism of its outlook. One innovation she particularly welcomes is the Next Big Thing strand, which screens short films such as as Meet Me By The Water by Scots-Asian writer-director Raisah Ahmed.ldquoI think therersquos been quite a range of programming. It seems like they are trying to be erse in terms of their representation. So obviously you have Getting Hitched Asian Style and The Nine, which is trying to tackle current debates around issues of representation. So I think it has been quite successful so far.And does it matterratings are low for some programmes ldquoI donrsquot know that it does this early on. I think itrsquos important that we have access to original Scottish programming at a local and national level.There are other challenges, she thinks, besides ratings. One is establishing the channelrsquos identity. ldquoIrsquom not quite sure what its brand is yet in terms of how itrsquos selling itself. I noticed that before the launch it was targeting young people with this notion of fresh and original ideas, but I donrsquot know whether theyrsquoll be able to sustain that.Another is proving that the bold talk ndash of nurturing young talent, giving voice to dferent groups and communities, taking risks and tackling ersity ndash will be backed by bold actions.Wherersquos the Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for example  And how embedded is the commitment to ersity and inclusion, to actually hearing new voices and seeing dferent stories rather than it just being rhetoric with no change Theyrsquore questions for which Steve Carson has a ready answer. Sothe Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge was out there with a project she was aching to make, is he convinced he would find her and commission it ldquoI hope so. And I think we are finding quite extraordinary talent at all levels and also stretching people who might already have done one thing but are now doing something . Like State Of It, which is Robert Florence [co-writer of sketch show Burnistoun] doing quite a scabrous satirical show. Itrsquoll be coming out in the autumn.There is data which can help, however. A measuring system known as ldquosocial listening can analyse social media responses to any subject and from that gain an insight into how that subject is viewed, expressed as the over-riding emotion associated with it.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzBBC Scotland set the algorithms running at launch and four weeks later the results came back. ldquoThe strongest emotion in social listening was surprise, says Carson. ldquoThat was really encouraging. So modern Scotland, outward looking, surprising and focussed on new talent ndash thatrsquos the core identity of the channel. SoBBC Scotland is a keyboard emoji, itrsquos a colon and a zero.Three months ago, the channel launched with a Miracle. Whether itrsquoll need another one to make it sing in the long term is harder to judge. As they probably donrsquot teach you to say in continuity announcer school, watch this space.BBC Scotland: The Good, The Bad And The NineGetting Hitched Asian StyleA behind-the-scenes documentary following Glasgow wedding planners Saffron Events as they prepare for a succession of glamorous weddings, Getting Hitched Asian Style proved so successful that it received a repeat run on BBC One and has been re-commissioned for a second series on BBC Scotland. Produced by the Scottish ision of London-based Firecracker Films itrsquos a good example of the channelrsquos stated commitment to programmes which reflect Scotlandrsquos ersity. Verdict: funny, interesting, occasionally jaw-dropping but ultimately humane.A View From The TerraceBorn out of The Terrace, a long-running podcast, AVFTT is fronted by four young presenterswho sit on sofas and talk engagingly about Scottish football. Refreshingly free of Old Firm bias itrsquos fast becoming a Friday night staple for those fans of the Beautul Game who think subjects such as the on- and off-field shenanigans of Partick Thistle legend Chic Charnley or how Eriskay has one of the best pitches in the world are as worthy of discussion as whorsquoll be the next manager of Real Madrid. Verdict: a great signing.Sanjeev Kohlirsquos Big TalkA weekly show in which the comedian is joined by a  of guests for a ldquosideways look at the big issues of the week, filmed in what looks like the foyer of the BBCrsquos Pacic Quay HQ in Glasgow in front of what looks like a smattering of audience members. ldquoI never in my le want to endure another excruciatingly mirthless hour of supposedly witty commentary on the weekrsquos news, wrote one Herald critic. ldquoIt was so awful the only way to hang on to consciousness was to watch what was happening outside the glass-fronted studio. Less trenchant criticism has concentrated on the showrsquos stfness and its uneven format. Verdict: could do better.WonderballItrsquos probably destined for cult status among Generation Z-ers as an endless source of memes, but in the here and now BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship gameshow hasnrsquot been exactly showered with love. Letrsquos not take it too far, though: Wonderball is not, as right-leaning tabloid the Daily Mail has suggested, the worst show of its type ever aired, eventhat paper might like it to be. But you canrsquot say that those who have pointed out its flaws ndash the somewhat complicated rules, say, or the unintentional snigger value of two young men being instructed to play with the blue balls ndash donrsquot have a case. It hasnrsquot been a ratings hit either, with viewership dropping as low as  for one episode. Verdict: not utterly pointless, but not likely to become the next Pointless.The NineA team of talented and accomplished presenters, a  minute running time and a news agenda that blends hard-hitting investigations with quirky or thought-provoking items hasnrsquot stopped BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship news programme taking considerable flak from some quarters. Earlier this month one newspaper talked of a ldquotalent exodus from the channel and quoted a BBC insider who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. Damage has undoubtedly been done as a result: negative news stories about behind-the-scenes tensions and potential resignations may not be true, but they contribute to a narrative of failure which becomes hard to shake over time. What is true is that ratings for The Nine have been disappointing on occasions, though in mitigation its time slot doesnrsquot help. Verdict: a rocky start for a potentially stellar offering that may flourish in a dferent time slot."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9892229.jpg?type=article-full","title":"how-to-plan-your-perfect-tailor-made-holiday","story":"Bespoke luxury holidays are a dominant force within the current climate, with more and more travellers setting their sights on worldwide locations and unique pursuits.

country is on alert over water scarcity due to low rainfall levels in April and May.Scottish Water has asked parts of the Western Isles and Argyll to make conservation efforts by taking shorter showers and only washing car windscreens and lights instead of the whole vehicle.Those affected currently involve customers served by the Tolsta Water Treatment Worksin north Lewis and by the Tarbert WTW in Argyll are being asked to take steps to save water.Other water conservation measures suggested include using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket to wash vehicles and using washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has placed a Moderate Scarcity orange alert in Argyll, the Western Isles, and the northwest of the country.A yellow water scarcity alert exists everywhere  except the Northern Isles and south Scotland, which have an early warning in place.The agency has issued a request to farmers and golf course managers in all areas of Scotland except the south region when using water from burns and small rivers to only irrigate only when necessary and at night to cut evaporation losses.It said water sources used for irrigation of farmland to grow agricultural crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate are at risk of becoming \"limited\" in all areas of Scotland.The agency also suggested farmers explore how they and their neighbours in the same river catchment could avoid irrigating at the same time.SEPA said: \"River levels are still extremely low across western Scotland, particularly in the north-west.\"Further evidence of environmental impacts and impacts on private water supplies have been reported and therefore a Moderate Scarcity level has been set for this area.\"Some rainfall is forecast for the north west in the week ahead but it is not yet clear how much this will ease the situation.\"In each river catchment there is some degree of water storage, which can maintain river flows even when it is not raining.This natural water storage is mainly held in lochs and groundwater.SEP says that when natural storage has been depleted it will take a lot of rainfall for levels to recover.Currently loch levels in the north-west were described as \"low for the time of year\" following relatively dry conditions.And groundwater levels along the east coast were described as \"still very low for the time of year\".Scottish Water said that reservoir levels across Scotland were currently at  per cent and \"generally good\".But it said that despite some rainfall in parts of the country at the weekend, Scottish Water hydrologists say it has not helped to replenish to any signicant level water sources in certain areas.A Scottish Water spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore asking customers in these two areas, Tolsta on Lewis and Tarbert in Kintyre, to consider how they use their water and to follow our advice about how they can use water wisely.ldquoThe weather in these areas during most of April and May has been very dry and there has been a drop in reservoir levels that supply the water treatment works which serve our customers there.ldquoWe have a strong and resilient distribution network to keep our customers supplied, but wersquore asking everyone to play their part by considering what they can do to help us maintain supplies.Scottish Water is to attend a series of events across the country over summer as part of a Your Water Your Le campaign to talk to communities about how to use water

to replace her to claim they can strike a swt and better deal with Brussels.Boris Johnson and other hardline Brexiters have claimed they could force the EU to sht its position on the Irish backstop that bedevilled Mrs May.But European Commission president Jean Claude-Juncker yesterday dismissed notions of the EU falling into line for a new Prime Minister, saying: ldquoThere will be no renegotiation.It came as the race for Number  intensied as the field expanded to  with the entry of two more Tory MPs - junior Brexit minister James Cleverly and the former deputy mayor of London under Mr Johnson, Kit Malthouse.Mr Malthouse gave his name to the Malthouse compromise, a plan to replace the Irish backstop with alternative arrangements, that the EU and Number  said was unworkable.Also standing are Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart.Appearing for the first time in public since announcing her resignation timetable last Friday, Mrs May said her successor had to find ldquoconsensus with other  EU states.At a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels to discuss replacements for Mr Juncker and EU Council president Donald Tusk, the Prime Minister admitted the European election results had been ldquodeeply disappointing for the Tories, who collapsed to fth place on a .% vote share.A victory for Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party has seen Tory leadership contenders sht towards a no-deal Brexit in order to fend off a possible general election challenge from the new party.Mrs May said: ldquoIrsquove always taken a view that the best option for the UK is to leave the European Union with a deal. Irsquom not going to comment on the views of inidual candidates.ldquoThere will be a process of selecting my successor as leader of the Conservative party but I continue to have the view that itrsquos best for the UK to leave with a deal.She went on: ldquoOf course the European election results were deeply disappointing for the party. What it shows is the importance of actually delivering Brexit.ldquoI think the best way of doing that is with a deal but it will be for my successor and for parliament to find a way forward to get a consensus and I hope that those election results will focus parliament on the need to deliver Brexit.Mr Hunt, who has the most number of declared supporters among MPs, warned a no-deal Brexit would be ldquopolitical suicide for the Tories.The Foreign Secretary said MPs would block it with a no confidence vote that would force a general election which would probably ldquoannihilate the Tories and ldquoput Jeremy Corbyn in No  by Christmas.He said he would try to reopen negotiations with the EU to achieve a ldquodferent deal.He said: ldquoThat means negotiations that take us out of the customs union while generously respecting legitimate concerns about the Irish border. Why would the EU leaders do that  Because they do not want the shadow of Brexit hanging over them. Go to them with a shared problem and there is a chance of a shared solution.Mr Stewart, the only candidate to rule out no-deal, hit back at suggestions he was a ldquosuicide bomber who was only in the race to clear a path for Mr Gove.He said the remark was in bad taste given his diplomatic experience in Iraq and blamed supporters of Mr Johnson who were worried by his run.The International Development Secretary said: ldquoIrsquom not running tactically - I am running on principle and because I believe we can uny this country and make it a much better place.He also outlined plans for setting up a salaried citizens assembly of  members of the public who would be paid to work out a Brexit plan instead of parliament. He said he had been inspired by Irelandrsquos assembly on abortion.He told the : ldquoI have a lot of confidence that we are one of the most educated and articulate populations on Earth and thatwe had a citizensrsquo assembly they would be able to do what parliament has failed to do: step back, put party politics aside and look at a sensible resolution to this.ldquoYou need a Brexit deal to last for  years ndash the danger of revoke or no deal is that you end up in a very unstable situation. The issues are set up as very binary but actually in Ireland they broke it down to a whole series of dferent questions.Sir Nicholas Soames, a grandson of Winston Churchill, backed Mr Stewart as the only candidate ldquowho can sort out Brexit, unite our party and restore pride and hope to Britain.Mr Raab launched a campaign video emphasising ldquofairness and said he would like a ldquolegally binding exchange of letters to give the UK a clear exit from the so-called backstop."},{"url":null,"title":"calmac-campaigners-cast-light-on-pier-that-is-too-dark-to-be-safe","story":"Craignure Pier on Mull has weathered the worst of west coast storms, up to  ferries a day and the weight of an astonishing annual , passengers.Now a new dossier of correspondence reveals that it has withstood it all with only the most basic of maintenance.Neglect, say campaigners, means the  concrete and timber jetty is now more than showing its age and earlier this year the structure had to be closed after a piece broke away.Locals and visitors alike are worried and so is Caledonian MacBrayne, the state-owned company whose ferry service from Oban docks at Craignure.After this springrsquos problems a local group, the Mull and Iona Ferry Committee, used Freedom of Information laws to find out just how bad the situation was. It discovered the jetty, owned by Argyll and Bute Council, has lighting that is so bad ferries sometimes had to be cancelled.Ferry committee chairwoman Elizabeth Ferguson said the revelations had been shocking.She said: ldquoAn email of    states: ldquoThe lack of lighting, especially at the pump shed linkspan is causing us serious issues. We had a near miss this morning. Can you please have these addressed as soon as possible Another concerning email from CalMac in  states: ldquoPump shed roof leaking, water dripping into light fittings. Please deal with as a matter of urgency.Fteen months later CalMac raises the leaking roof problem again, emailing the council to say: ldquoAs has been advised for some time now, the pump shed roof leaks into a light fitting, which can be seen smoking inside. This has potential for causing a fire. Can you address ASAP.In October , another email from CalMac reveals: ldquoThe guys are having great dficulty in seeing the heaving lines being thrown during the hours of darkness. The pierhead LED was swapped for sodium, we have repeatedly asked for it to be changed back, but it has never been done.Mrs Ferguson said: ldquoIn the weekly checklists submitted by CalMac between January  and December , lighting faults have been reported on  weeks out of . In other words, over that seven-year period, the pier lighting was only reported fault-free for just  weeks.ldquoPoor lighting at Craignure pier is repeatedly cited by CalMac as one of the reasons for cancellations in hours of darkness and inclement weather, yet the evidence of the weekly checklist and the email correspondence is that not only is the lighting system very poor, but repairs take a long time to be completed.Mrs Ferguson added: ldquoThe port weekly checklists from  to December  report a fender fault of one kind or another for  weeks out of , ie for only  weeks out of seven years did the weekly checklists report that there were no fender faults. Improvements seem to be completely absent. Upgrade of Craignure street lights and pier lighting to LED has been promised for several years, but has yet to materialise.ldquoThe water supply has been leaking without a permanent fix for five years.Craignure Pier is not alone in facing questions over whether it is fit for purpose. Argyll  Bute Council has long faced criticism for the state of infrastructure along a coastline that is longer than Francersquos.It has a multi-million-pound linkspan in Dunoon on the Cowal Peninsula that has no car ferry to service. Its pier at Helensburgh has lost its once regular Clyde ferries and needs pound million worth of repairs.Over the years there has been a pattern of problems, such as the specially built jetty extension at Bruichladdich that often could not handle the fuel tanker needed for Islayrsquos whisky distilleries.Islanders and coastal communities are angry, not least because piers make money. CalMacrsquos Oban-Craignure Service is its second busiest. The emails obtained under FoI, including CalMacrsquos weekly port reports, show Argyll  Bute spent only pound, on pier repairs and maintenance, over seven years while it received more than pound million in fees over the same period.Billy McClymont, chairman of Mull Community Council, speaking after the April closure, said: ldquoThe pier takes in almost pound.m a year. Itrsquos the golden goose and itrsquos a real slap in the teeth that they have spent nothing on the pier.Mr McClymont said the community council was set to join Coll, Colonsay and Tiree, in a new Confederation of Islands being planned to fight for a bigger political voice for islanders, as they claim they have been ignored for years by the council and the Scottish Government.This comes despite good news for the island. A new ferry is needed to handle a  per cent increase in the routersquos traffic as a result of the introduction of Road Equivalent Tarf in .But Craignure is not big enough for bigger ships. A recent Scottish Transport Analysis Guide appraisal stated that the north and south berths at the pier were too short for larger ferries.Meanwhile, CalMac has its own headaches, including an ageing fleet, with many past their lespans and more than  years old."},{"url":null,"title":"satnav-firms-asked-to-help-keep-left-campaign-for-tourist-drivers","story":"But now the issue of tourists driving on the wrong side of Scotlandrsquos roads has become so frequent that local politicians are seeking the help of global tech giants such as Google and Apple to remind drivers to keep left.Kate Forbes MSP, has written to the firms askingreminders can be added to their satellite navigation apps and devices telling drivers to keep left.A number of high-profile incidents involving international visitors driving on the right hand side in the Highlands have provoked calls for more to be done to educate drivers.The SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch hopes notications can be included in satellite technology in a similar way to warnings to remain within the speed limit.Over half a million international travellers flock to the Scottish Highlands every year, according to VisitScotland, with many hiring cars and campervans to travel around some of the remote landmarks.Last week motorist Alan McConachie, from Elgin, was travelling home from a weekend in Glasgow when he witnessed a motorhome driving on the wrong side of the A dual carriageway.The shocking video posted online showed the motorhome hurtling down the inside lane, forcing oncoming cars out of its way.Mr McConachie said: ldquoI was behind him for miles. Just before the road becomes a dual carriageway he panicked and went across to the other side.

In December, local resident Sharon Anslow was on her way to work when she collided with a Fiat  being driven on the wrong side of the road by two tourists.Ms Anslow was left with minor injuries after her car plunged down a steep embankment near the Sligachan Hotel after colliding with the car.The mother-of-three, who is one of Ms Forbesrsquo constituents, subsequently launched the ldquoKeep Left campaign in an effort to raise awareness for tourists driving through the area.A petition started by Ms Anslow, to increase road signs or prompts telling drivers to keep left, has now received over , signatures. Signatories to the petition shared their similar experiences while driving on the island.Val Nash posted: ldquoI have been faced with cars and on one occasion a van, coming towards me on my side of the road.ldquoReminders are needed, especially after a parking area and heading into passing places on single-track road.While Brian McIlroy said: ldquoIrsquom a weekly commuter to the island we need to do everything we can to make driving safer on Skye. [The] #keepleft is a fantastic campaign.ldquoBetter road markings and less cluttered signage. Anything that helps visitors and locals.Following her accident, Ms Anslow said she was lucky to be alive after she was cut from the wreckage of her car by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.ldquoThe more people I speak to the more I realise that this is a massive issue on the island and something has to be done before somebody is killed, she posted on the petition page.Speaking to BBC Scotland Ms Anslow added: ldquoItrsquos terrying. I relive the moment all the time and try to figure outI could have done anything dferently, but I couldnrsquot have done.Ms Forbes, the Minister for Public Finance and Digital Economy, has been campaigning on behalf of her constituents to increase road safety.She said she has already contacted car hire companies to raise awareness of the issue.One company, Skye Car Hire, received praise last week after including ldquoKeep Left stickers with their hire vehicles, and encouraging tourists to place them on the steering wheel.Ms Forbes said: ldquoNobody intentionally drives on the wrong side of the road, but clearly wersquove got to do more to remind visitors to drive on the left.

These geriatric king-makers intend to install a leader in Nigel Faragersquos image, preferably Boris Johnson. He or she will then propel the UK into the self-inflicted turmoil of a No Deal Brexit.This is madness. Yet Scottish voters will be left watching this doomsday clock tick away inexorably till their economic welfare is sacriced on the altar of Brexit on Halloween. The prospect of No Deal may inspire a wartime spirit among Brexit voters, but the vast majority of Scottish voters see this as an act of wilful self-harm by a political elite who have lost the plot.The Scottish Governmentrsquos chief economic adviser says that No Deal could cost Scotland pound billion in less than a year. This on top of possible food and medicine shortages, and transport disruption as the UK severs its settled relations with its biggest trading partner. The longer-term impact of tarfs and lost markets could, according to the Scottish Government, cost , jobs in Scotland.Project fear  Perhaps. But not even the most starry-eyed Brexiter believes that No Deal would be cost-free. The question is: what can the Scottish government, and Holyrood, do to prevent this  Nicola Sturgeon says she wants an independence referendum in late , but by then, the damage will already have been done.I have argued against an advisory referendum on independence for the obvious reasons: Unionists would boycott it and Westminster would ignore it. But the way things are going, there may not be time to wait around for a Section  Order that never arrives. The situation is becoming critical.The Scottish Parliament needs to think carefully today about how it intends to respond to the reckless behaviour of the governing party in the UK.Gone are the visions of a smooth and orderly transition to Brexit, negotiated in goodwill with Brussels. Theresa Mayrsquos likely successors ndash Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Esther McVey ndash are behaving like intoxicated football fans before an away match. ldquoCome on you Brussels they slur, ldquo you think yoursquore hard enough.Even those who would prefer negotiation, like the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, are being swept way by No Deal fever. No sooner had he said that leaving without a deal would be ldquopolitical suicide than his rivals were vying with each other to don the suicide vest. They yearn for a breakdown in relations with Europe, the better to express their pugnacious nationalism.Theresa Mayrsquos EU Withdrawal Deal, which took two years to negotiate, is dead and another cannot be renegotiated before the end of the current Brextension on October . In fact, one of the conditions of the extension, we now learn, was that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be reopened. There is, as Britainrsquos first female prime minister put it, no alternative.Anyway, there wonrsquot be a Brussels to negotiate with because both the President of the Council and the President of the European Commission are standing down and their successors wonrsquot be in place until November when Britain will already have left.This means Britain is heading like an express train for a clf-edge Brexit in five short months. And, as things stand, Scotland will be dragged over the precipice along with the rest of the UK. The game plan in the Brexit Bunker is for Prime Minister Boris, or whoever, to ignore Parliament, sit tight, and allow Britain to crash out by the remorseless legal logic of Article .Read more: Nicola Sturgeon plans for indyref next yearMany hope that Westminster will get its act together and block this ndash I certainly do. But there is no guarantee that our shell-shocked and confused MPs will be able to organise a successful no confidence motion to bring down the next prime minister and seize control. Nor is there a majority in Parliament for a repeat referendum, evenLabour were to persuade its dithering leader, Jeremy Corbyn, that it should support one. He says hersquoll think about it in September.Sothe House of Commons is now being held hostage by the Brexit revolutionaries, what can Holyrood do to save the day  Today, Nicola Sturgeon will unveil her bill for a repeat referendum, not on Europe, but on Scottish independence. However, todayrsquos bill does not actually legislate for Indyref . It merely provides the technical framework for a referendumand when Westminster agrees to make it legally binding by passing a Section  order. And the chances of that happening are precisely zero.For a start there is no prime minister to receive a Section  request. Theresa May has been reduced to the status of a piece of constitutional furniture for Donald Trumprsquos state visit. Her successor will be even less likely to contemplate breaking up the UK before the UK has departed from the EU. In fact, the prospect of any UK prime minister, Labour or Tory, agreeing to a Scottish referendum until well into the next decade seems remote.Yet, the case for a repeat referendum on Scottish independence is surely stronger than the case for the repeat Brexit referendum now advocated by Labour and the rejuvenated Liberal Democrats. Scots were told in  that only by remaining in the UK could they be sure of remaining in the EU. Now they are faced, not just with leaving Europe against their will, but crashing out of it in the worst possible terms. Material changes in circumstances donrsquot come much more material than this.Enough already. It may be necessary to advance the independence timetable and seek a test of Scottish opinion this autumn. At the very least, an advisory referendum would place on record that Scotland does not go willingly into the Brexit night."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Do not rush to judge Theresa May or any other leader","story":"The answer, of course, might be a bit of all three, and a lot more besides.

It discovered the jetty, owned by Argyll and Bute Council, has lighting that is so bad ferries sometimes had to be cancelled.Ferry committee chairwoman Elizabeth Ferguson said the revelations had been shocking.She said: ldquoAn email of    states: ldquoThe lack of lighting, especially at the pump shed linkspan is causing us serious issues. We had a near miss this morning. Can you please have these addressed as soon as possible Another concerning email from CalMac in  states: ldquoPump shed roof leaking, water dripping into light fittings. Please deal with as a matter of urgency.Fteen months later CalMac raises the leaking roof problem again, emailing the council to say: ldquoAs has been advised for some time now, the pump shed roof leaks into a light fitting, which can be seen smoking inside. This has potential for causing a fire. Can you address ASAP.In October , another email from CalMac reveals: ldquoThe guys are having great dficulty in seeing the heaving lines being thrown during the hours of darkness. The pierhead LED was swapped for sodium, we have repeatedly asked for it to be changed back, but it has never been done.Mrs Ferguson said: ldquoIn the weekly checklists submitted by CalMac between January  and December , lighting faults have been reported on  weeks out of . In other words, over that seven-year period, the pier lighting was only reported fault-free for just  weeks.ldquoPoor lighting at Craignure pier is repeatedly cited by CalMac as one of the reasons for cancellations in hours of darkness and inclement weather, yet the evidence of the weekly checklist and the email correspondence is that not only is the lighting system very poor, but repairs take a long time to be completed.Mrs Ferguson added: ldquoThe port weekly checklists from  to December  report a fender fault of one kind or another for  weeks out of , ie for only  weeks out of seven years did the weekly checklists report that there were no fender faults. Improvements seem to be completely absent. Upgrade of Craignure street lights and pier lighting to LED has been promised for several years, but has yet to materialise.ldquoThe water supply has been leaking without a permanent fix for five years.Craignure Pier is not alone in facing questions over whether it is fit for purpose. Argyll  Bute Council has long faced criticism for the state of infrastructure along a coastline that is longer than Francersquos.It has a multi-million-pound linkspan in Dunoon on the Cowal Peninsula that has no car ferry to service. Its pier at Helensburgh has lost its once regular Clyde ferries and needs pound million worth of repairs.Over the years there has been a pattern of problems, such as the specially built jetty extension at Bruichladdich that often could not handle the fuel tanker needed for Islayrsquos whisky distilleries.Islanders and coastal communities are angry, not least because piers make money. CalMacrsquos Oban-Craignure Service is its second busiest. The emails obtained under FoI, including CalMacrsquos weekly port reports, show Argyll  Bute spent only pound, on pier repairs and maintenance, over seven years while it received more than pound million in fees over the same period.Billy McClymont, chairman of Mull Community Council, speaking after the April closure, said: ldquoThe pier takes in almost pound.m a year. Itrsquos the golden goose and itrsquos a real slap in the teeth that they have spent nothing on the pier.Mr McClymont said the community council was set to join Coll, Colonsay and Tiree, in a new Confederation of Islands being planned to fight for a bigger political voice for islanders, as they claim they have been ignored for years by the council and the Scottish Government.This comes despite good news for the island. A new ferry is needed to handle a  per cent increase in the routersquos traffic as a result of the introduction of Road Equivalent Tarf in .But Craignure is not big enough for bigger ships. A recent Scottish Transport Analysis Guide appraisal stated that the north and south berths at the pier were too short for larger ferries.Meanwhile, CalMac has its own headaches, including an ageing fleet, with many past their lespans and more than  years old."},{"url":null,"title":"awpr road users urged to take their litter home","story":"Transport Scotland and Aberdeen Roads Limited are asking road users to improve the safety of workers by disposing of their litter responsibly.One of Aberdeen Road Limited’s duties during its -year maintenance contract is to carry out litter picking when required. This means workers have to collect litter by hand that has either been dropped from passing vehicles or left behind in lay-bys.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland’s Project Manager for the AWPR B-T project explained: “The process of collecting litter from the side of a trunk road places road workers right next to high speed traffic, which can be dangerous. However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users. Littering on a road can also cause damage to vehicle tyres or windscreens.“In circumstances where road policing officers observe anyone to be littering on any road, they will take appropriate action.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Kilted Chef Craig Wilson raids Oldmeldrum local Liz Millars fridge\"  Kilted Chef sets out to reduce food waste viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"glad rags and cartridge bags calling all prince charmings","story":"Scotlands premier all female shooting club, Glad Rags  Cartridge Bags is hoping to add a bit of romance to their event in June.It’s a first for the club as Mhairi Morriss owner of Jomm Events and founder of Glad Rags and Cartridge Bags explained: “I have so many wonderful ladies coming to our events, but some have not found their prince charming yet so I thought I would try and give cupid a helping hand by organising a fun evening of clay shooting and supper for all the single lads and lassies.”Mhairi stressed that it will be a fun relaxed evening with all abilities of shot very welcome from complete beginners to the more experienced.

To enter the competition, members of the public should post a portrait photo celebrating walking in some way, on Twitter or Instagram, using the hashtag #HumansOfTheWalk. Multiple entries are allowed with the competition running until Friday, May , next week. Those who take part are in with the chance of winning a Nikon B Coolpix camera.Ian Findlay, chief officer at Paths for All, said: “Orkney has a number of great walking routes — whether it’s residential streets or local paths and green spaces — and we’re keen for the community to celebrate how they make these part of their daily routines.“We want the photos to be a true reflection of everyday walking — walking that builds friendships, gives you headspace and gets you feeling fitter and out enjoying nature.“Walking can help prevent ill health, build communities and create a happier, healthier, greener Scotland and we know that people can demonstrate just that with their Humans of the Walk photos. “We want to revolutionise the way people use their cities, and stop our spaces from being dominated by cars. Scotland’s towns and cities should be a backdrop for people walking, scooting, cycling or simply spending time enjoying cleaner, quieter, calmer streets.“Paths for All is looking forward to seeing them all and wish everyone who enters the competition the best of luck.”Paths For All#s aim is to signicantly increase the number of people who choose to walk in Scotland, whether it’s walking for leisure, to work, to school or to the shops. The charity works to create more opportunities and better environments for walking, as well as cycling and other activities to help make Scotland a more active and greener place.For more information on Humans of the Walk and the competition, visit: https:www.pathsforall.org.uk humanscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is both the highest volume of advance sales ever achieved in the voluntary-run festival’s -year tenure, as well as the greatest number of pre-festival sellouts. Stromness, the festival’s hometown in Orkney’s West Mainland, has already begun welcoming early arrivals, including some of this year’s furthest travelled visitors # Cape Breton’s globetrotting powerhouse quartet, Còig # as well as famed Irish singer Cara Dillon and Irish firebrands Four Men and a Dog, who are currently celebrating their th year on the road.Whilst early arrivals are no rarity for the festival, a far greater number than usual are already in Orkney, owing to a one-day Air Traffic Controllers’ strike across Scotland’s Highlands and Islands taking place today. As well as the closure of Kirkwall Airport, Inverness — a hub for flights from Ireland and England, before the final hop up to the islands — is also shut. With just a fortnight’s notice,  inbound arrivals originally scheduled for today, Thursday, have been rerouted, leading to early arrivals for most.Those already enjoying Orkney’s famed hospitality will soon be joined by fellow headliners including the groundbreaking Scottish three-piece, Lau a newly formed trio of celebrated Irish musicians John Doyle, Dermot Byrne and Éamonn Coyne and internationally renowned Hebridean vocalists, Julie Fowlis and Kathleen MacInnes, who visit Orkney as part ‘Between Islands’ # a collaborative project led by Stornoway’s An Lanntair, uniting musicians from Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. Emerging artists are also prominent in this year’s festival programme, with appearances from BBC Radio Scotland’s Young Musician of the Year , Benedict Morris new Scottish six-piece Heisk and Helensburgh fiddler Ryan Young, whose accompanist, Jenn Butterworth, will work a double-sht across the next four nights, also playing with the high-spirited Glasgow group Kinnaris Quintet. In total,  acts will meet in Stromness — with the  visiting acts welcomed and outnumbered by Orkney’s thriving local folk scene, which itself features internationally renowned artists such as Saltfishforty, The Chair, The Wrigley Sisters and Gnoss, alongside local favourites including Hullion, the Kirkwall City Pipe Band # currently celebrating their centenary year # and many more. This amounts to an estimated  featured musicians # though many more will meet in Stromness, with the town’s pubs and hotels bursting with informal pub sessions from opening to closing time across the four days, alongside the ticketed programme. As well as Stromness, this year the festival reaches out to communities in Birsay, Burray, Finstown, Kirkwall, Orphir, Quoyloo, Sanday, Sandwick, St Margaret’s Hope, Stenness and Tankerness.In order to stage such a large event, the festival gratefully receives generous support from public bodies and corporate sponsors, from throughout the local and national business communities. This year’s principal supporters are Orkney Islands Council, Creative Scotland, NorthLink Ferries, Loganair — who also facilitated the rebooking of all those affected by the air traffic strike at zero cost, the Pier Arts Centre, and EIS, alongside many more inidual event sponsors and corporate patrons. The festival also benefits from many thousands of hours donated by hundreds of volunteers, who give their time freely to bring the world-renowned event together. From the twelve-strong year round management committee, to those who might work on just one event in their local community hall, each one of the festival’s community team is vital to its long standing, continued and increasing success.Festival director, Bob Gibbon said: “After many months of preparation we are delighted to be welcoming visitors and artists from far and wide, friends old and new, musicians from across the globe, to Orkney for what is set to be a memorable weekend of fun and good times. #Everyone has come together create a magnicent programme of events, and the festival just gets better and better. Orkney should rightly be very proud of what we can share, and this weekend is about sharing music, memories, time and happiness. Enjoy it everyone!”The festival’s chair, Elaine Grieve added: #I say this every year but I#m really excited about the programme for the weekend. There#s something for everyone fabulous visiting acts and a great number of local artists — and that#s something we really want to share with audiences. #It#s such a lovely time with many familiar faces ing and new joining the fold # a bit like a huge family reunion!#Alan Morrison, head of music at Creative Scotland said: “There are few places in Scotland with a more magical atmosphere than Orkney, where the stones of past civilisations sit alongside the buzz of the modern world. That’s also true of the Orkney Folk Festival, where the island’s heritage is woven into music being made by some of our best standard-bearers and rising stars. #It’s great to see so many brilliantly talented artists sharing a bill with musicians from far and near – andsome of them had to arrive a day early, well, that just means the sessions are already underway.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The final, which was held in Essex on Saturday, May , saw the finalists complete five tough physical challenges, as well as an interview with judges focusing on mental health.The competition was launched to promote mental and physical health in agriculture in a fun and engaging way.Mr Cursiter was announced as the men#s winner today, with -year-old Fiona Penfold, from the West Country, announced as the women#s winner.Asked about the importance of fitness to both mental and physical health, Sean said: #Farmers are constantly being required to produce cheap food while input costs rise. In Orkney there are a lot of farmers on their own, with  cows, living a lonely existence — they might not see another person for weeks.#He said that#s why he makes a conscious effort to socialise with others. Playing rugby for Orkney#s first team is a big part of this.#If folks close themselves in and just farm, then that#s not a good state of mind to be in. It#s hard to come away from the farm and be social, but it does have its benefits, and sometimes the lack of time is over-used as an excuse.##There are  hours in the day, so you need to give one to yourself. It#s good to have a hobby, and I don#t find that my sport has a negative effect on the farm.#For more on this story, see next week#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One of these # probably the most common question addressed to authors is: Where do you get your ideas from  Ask an author this, and you will get, in the first place, a thin smile that is actually a wince, quickly disguised as a thin smile. It is, of course, a perfectly understandable question. Do authors make things up, or are they inspired by what they have seen or heard  Or do they perhaps get them from the books of other authors  Is there a great Jungian soup of ideas somewhere in the human consciousness from which authors may select salient plots Possibly, but most authors will answer tactiturnly and pass, as quickly as possible, to the next question. Some authors,they are unduly irritated by this enquiry, will reply: “From a mail order company called Ideas Ltd”. That is a discourteous reply, and not recommended, but is sometimes tempting.The other question that occurs very commonly is: What were your favourite books as a child  Now that is an interesting question to ask anybody, author or not. And while we’re here, perhaps you might like to think about it. Can you remember Since you ask, as a small boy I had two. One was The Boy’s Book of Merchant Shipping, a small, blue-bound book that featured, in infinitely boring detail, a long list of merchant ships, along with a small line drawing of each. Tonnages were listed, as were dates of construction and normal routes. That was all. It was a book without any human characters. It was, in effect, a merchant shipping trade directory, disguised as a book for hapless boys.I loved it, and slept with it under my pillow, an attachment that brings to mind W.H. Auden’s lines: When I was a child, I Loved a pumping engine, Thought it every bit as  Beautul as you. Sometimes today I think back to it and reflect on how,I still had it, it would be ideally placed under the pillow – a sure remedy for any bout of insomnia. One might forget the usual remedies for sleeplessness and resort, instead, to a brief dip into The Boy’s Book of Merchant Shipping. How quickly would sleep overcome one as one perused the features of coastal steamers. So, these otherwise unreadable books may have their uses. I once read five pages of the Swaziland Telephone Directory, and enjoyed the experience. There were some wonderful names listed, including somebody called Charlie P. Charlie. I would have loved to have met him – or at least to have phoned him.My other favourite book as a boy was called Ginger’s Adventures. I loved that book every bit as much as my list of merchant ships. Unlike The Boy’s Book of Merchant Shipping this book was in verse, or doggerel, perhaps. Anyway, it rhymed, and had an unying metre. It tells the tale of a boy called Tommy, who had a dog called Ginger. I would have enjoyed it evenit had stopped there, but there was more. Tommy lived on a farm and wore an old-fashioned smock. Today he might have been recognised as a cross-dresser – but not in those days. His dog, Ginger, was accused – unjustly – of chasing ducks and sent off to live where. The word we now use is rehoused, but that was not available then. People were kicked out in those days, rather than rehoused.Ginger’s new home was in London. That was bad enough, but for a dog it was pretty awful. And then, to pile Pelion upon Ossa, his new owner was a girl. Today, of course, in a modern edition of this book, Tommy would be a girl anyway and Ginger would be a bitch. But in those days, they were male. Ginger did not like living in London, where he was obliged to sleep on a satin cushion. I remember looking enviously at the picture of the satin cushion. We had no satin cushions in our house. Children’s books are often slyly aspirational.Just when things are looking pretty bleak for Ginger, he decides to run away. Off he goes, and at last ends up back on the farm. There, all appears to be forgiven and he is allowed to stay with Tommy once again. The end.Now it would be possible to deconstruct this story in a trice. Ph.D. theses have been written on less fertile ground than that, but one thing is clear: Ginger’s Adventures would not make it into print today. And that leads to a serious question. Nobody would suggest that today’s boys should be subjected to such sexist messages, even subliminal ones, but a legitimate question might he asked as to whether boys’ needs are being adequately addressed. There are plenty of books that quite properly portray girls fulfilling roles that in the past were dominated by boys. These books are important. There are also books that convey to boys the message that they can take on roles that have in the past been the province of girls. There is currently a book about a boy who dreams of becoming a mermaid.But what about boys who don’t want to become mermaids  There must be some. I never wanted to be a mermaid. Never. But that was entirely to do with the problems of breathing underwater. That’s all.Somebody should write a book called It’s All Right to be a Boy. A sensitive book, mind. But perhaps the hero could dream of becoming a lumberjack. With a tartan shirt. Or a pilot. Boys would love that – and we must keep them reading.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"game of thrones star kit harington checks into wellness retreat","story":"Game Of Thrones star Kit Harington has checked into a \"wellness retreat\" to work on \"personal issues\", his representative has said.The -year-old London-born actor has reportedly been at a facility in the US state of Connecticut.In a statement, his representative said: \"Kit has decided to utilise this break in his schedule as an opportunity to spend some time at a wellness retreat to work on some personal issues.\"READ MORe: Leading theatre company to close in wake of Creative Scotland funding blowHarington played Jon Snow in HBOs massively popular fantasy series Game Of Thrones, which came to an end this month after eight seasons.A documentary about the show, The Last Watch, was released on Sunday and showed Harington in tears when he learned about his characters fate.He told Esquire in April he broke down after filming Jons final scenes.: North Coast  movie to premiere this summerHe said: \"The final day of shooting, I felt fine ...

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

Farm attacks in South Africa are reported almost on a daily basis to the rest of the world and must be condemned. There is no denying they happen, the tragic results are plain to see. But what can be done about it  How does this affect how other farmers get on with le and their daily work I’ve been fortunate enough to visit and report from South Africa on five separate occasions now over the past  years and come away each time with a sense of dismissal but also hope.South Africa is a beautul country, physically, and produces some of the best food and wine demanded by consumers around the world.Politically, it’s a dferent place. A place where the state is not in charge. A state that cannot even control its basic power supply, without some form of corruption.But where does that leave agriculture and the farmers  No matter what political persuasion anyone holds, everyone must eat. Over the years of visiting farms in South Africa I noticed farmers becoming despondent, feeling let down, feeling a sense of ‘what’s the point of it all ’I’ve talked to farmers who were attacked, who lost loved ones, and who gave up.However, during my latest visit in early March this year I witnessed a positivity among farmers that really I never experienced before.Yes, nothing politically has changed, except for the worst, but farmers are more defiant, more ambitious and are investing to make their farms more efficient in order to give them a future.During the big livestock equipment show EuroTier in Germany last November I talked to a few South African farmers interested to see how technology could make their farms more efficient. It was really comforting to visit a number of farmers on this trip who are putting new technology to play in order to improve their businesses. Visiting Greenway Farms Ltd with headquarters at Tarlton to see how business partners Vito Rugani and Vincent Sequeira handle over , tonnes of carrots per year grown on , hectares was really inspiring.The passion and ambition shown by these leading vegetable farmers has resulted in a range of Rugani juices that are now being exported across the world. They have invested heavily in new state of the art equipment to extract juice from vegetables. The science is baffling, the set-up is extremely professional and as for the juice, well…..I have to admit this was the first time I ever tried carrot juice and it was absolutely delicious. The knowledge I gained from Vito and his team will stay with me for a long time. I just hope he finds a way to export the range to the UK!Next visit was to Corne Nel’s Doornfontein Melkery in Randfontein where they milk  cows. Dairy unit manager Pieter Barnard gave me a very informative tour around the farm.Having been brought up on a dairy farm myself in Northern Ireland this visit was particularly interesting and I was also impressed to see more investment in equipment to make le easier. A new rotary parlour installed two years ago certainly speeds milking time up and perhaps investment into robotic milkers will help too with the dferent milking groups in the future. The sun can be a challenge where livestock are concerned and it was good to hear plans to build new housing in the corals to keep the cows cooler. With excellent production figures and a sound understanding of the cows, this farm is certainly gearing up for an exciting future.Before travelling across the border to visit farms in Botswana I went to see Sarel Haasbroek’s grain farm in the Carletonville area of Gauteng. Again this is another progressive farmer positive about the future and was excelling in importing the Horsch machinery brand into South Africa. Up in Francistown, eastern Botswana, I was warmly hosted by the Munger family at Wayside Brahman Stud Ltd for four nights. During my stay there I was given a comprehensive run down of the breeding herd, commercial herd, game farm, and the egg laying enterprise. What a farm! Rowland and his son Rowly are certainly well respected in the area and for the cattle they produce. Wayside was started by Rowland’s father Keith who was also present during my visit. And then it was off to see another beef farmer, this time with Bonsmara cattle, Calla Visser, for a very early start checking his cattle. Every night Calla has to go and round up over  cattle on his farm and herd them into outdoor corals for the night to protect them against theft and predators such as hyenas or leopards!And, every next morning Calla and his staff start very early going around the five dferent corals on his , hectare farm counting all the cows, calves and bulls hoping they all made it through the night alive.This, of course, is a new line of management for me but was nonetheless interesting to learn. A visit to Bobbsies Chickens Ltd based in the east at Tshesebe guided by general manager Gerhard van der Merwe was another super visit. Botswana, too, impressed me, as did the farmers there. I received detailed insight into the beef and poultry industries there and look forward to the next time I can visit.Some of the Botswanans though need to learn how to drive!

However, despite having his name cleared, Rev Watson has still been removed from the post he has held for the last twelve years after the congregation committee passed a vote of no confidence.Rev Watson, who has also served as the Moderator of the Iveagh Presbytery, was removed from his position in the church last Monday, even though he was cleared of immoral conduct earlier this year.The internal investigation was launched in April when Rev Watson, who is married with five children, became the centre of malicious rumours in the town. Rev Watson was accused of having an affair with a woman who said she was going through a orce at the time. She denied there was anyone  involved in her orce.The Judicial Commission of the Presbyterian Church found “no evidence” of the alleged misconduct and it was reported that a number of the church elders had “contributed” to spreading the rumours. Two members of Scarva Street Presbyterian Church have since been disciplined for their involvement. An elder was removed from his position and the Clerk of Session was also removed from his post, although he remains as an elder in the church.Rev Watson, who moved to Scarva Street Presbyterian from Donegal in , is said to be “devastated” by the decision. The Presbyterian Church have yet to find a replacement for Scarva Street Presbyterian and it is understood that Rev Watson has not yet found a new position.A spokesperson for the Presbyterian Church said that Rev Watson was “a minister of good standing with the Presbyterian Church.

The Taoiseach commented on the outcome of the vote here as he attended a European Council meeting of EU leaders in Brussels. \"What I think is really signicant, and I hope this has been noticed in Britain, is the result of the European elections in Northern Ireland, where for  years there have been two unionists and one nationalist,\" Mr Varadkar said. \"That is no longer the case.

Mr Hunt, one of  MPs vying to be the next prime minister, said a failure to solve Brexit could ruin the Conservatives and warned the \"biggest risk\" to delivering on the referendum was a general election. His comments came as Housing Minister Kit Malthouse became the latest person to enter the race to succeed Theresa May, saying there was a \"hunger for someone new\". Mrs May, attending a summit in Brussels, said the European election results in which the Tories took just % of the vote were \"deeply disappointing\". \"I think what it shows is the importance of actually delivering on Brexit. I think the best way to do that is with a deal,\" she said. \"But it will be for my successor and for Parliament to find a way forward and get a consensus.\" The comments are aimed at Brexiteers in the race to replace her who have said they are prepared to back a no-deal departure from the EU, something which could lead to a clash with Parliament. Mr Hunt warned rivals that calling a general election - potentially to win a mandate for a no-deal Brexit - could be a disaster for the Tories.He told BBC Radio s Today programme: \"We must not go back to the electorate asking for their mandate until weve delivered what we promised we would do last time, which is to deliver Brexit, it would be absolutely catastrophic for us as a party.\" Mr Hunt, who campaigned for Remain in the  referendum but has adopted an increasingly Eurosceptic tone, said he had \"always believed we should keep no deal on the table\" as it is the \"best way of getting a good deal\". He said it was important to \"find a dferent way to get a deal\", adding \"we have to have a go at this\" as he proposed forming a new wider negotiating team to change the Withdrawal Agreement. Leadership rival Dominic Raab also said he was focused on \"getting a fairer deal from the EU as we leave\". But outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed \"there will be no renegotiation\". The agreement between the EU and Mrs May to delay Brexit until October  included a commitment not to seek a renegotiation of the deal. Meanwhile, Mr Malthouse, who brought together Tory Leavers, the DUP and Remainers behind a compromise Brexit plan earlier this year, said he had a \"good number\" of MPs backing his bid. \"Weve got to find a way to unite the Conservative Party to deliver a Brexit plan so we can move onto a really compelling, attractive domestic agenda that might command victory at a general election,\" he said. \"One of the reasons that Im running is that Im the only person who has actually done that.\"Other candidates for the top job also started to offer a flavour of their policies should they win a ballot of Conservative Party members later this year. Michael Gove is prepared to offer free UK citizenship to three million nationals who resided in the UK at the time of the June  referendum. Matt Hancock wrote in the Daily Mail about \"driving up the living wage and cutting taxes\". In response to Mr Hunts warning that a no-deal Brexit election would be \"political suicide\", leadership rival Esther McVey responded: \"Political suicide actually lies in not having a clean break from the EU and not leaving on October .\" Others vying for the top job include Cabinet colleagues Sajid Javid, Andrea Leadsom and Rory Stewart, and current bookies favourite Boris Johnson. Meanwhile, Downing Street indicated the Withdrawal Agreement Bill may never be published."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38070562.ece/d6a67/BINARY/Heat_In-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"academics musicians and sports stars sign letter demanding irish language act","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He is a fully trained golden eagle so he doesnt pose any threat to anyone,\" he said.\"It was a freak accident that he got out from his enclosure. It has never happened before so I am really worried about him.\"He is more than likely within a five-mile radius, but it is not impossible for him to go further.\"He doesnt have any natural hunting instincts so he will be getting very hungry at this stage, although he will be fine up to two or three weeks.\"Golden eagles are natural scavengers so although he is a trained bird, mother nature might kick in and he might find himself a dead rabbit lying in the field. \"I have been out looking for him every day from early morning, but still havent seen him.\"Mr Gibb believeshe could find out where Grf is he would fly straight to him \"because he has bonded with me\".\"He is very close to me and likes to be with me, so he is a bit like a family pet in that respect. I am sureI found his location he should come right to me,\" he added.\"I have had some reports of people seeing him but so far these have turned out to be, I think, buzzards which are around the same size as a male golden eagle.

The parties are currently engaged in talks attempting to restore devolved government with civil servants responsible for running the country.Asked about her message to the local politicians, Baroness Paisley said they needed to \"lay aside their baggage and face facts\".\"So many petty things, they dont see the big picture,\" she said.\"So many people are crying out for help and they are failing them by not taking responsibility.\"It is going to get worse and that leaves us open to all sorts of trouble.\"She added: \"I would say to them cut out the petty things and dwell on things that matter - think of the people.She said she was \"aggrieved\" the  MLAs were still taking a salary and it was not fair on civil servants to be doing the job of elected representatives.\"It is abominable for people to take money for nothing,\" she added, \"they are not doing the job they were elected to do.\"Baroness Paisley also said the parties needed to be more open with the public, adding: \"There is nothing in the open, what goes on is hidden.\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.She was asked about the DUP fielding its first openly gay candidate, Alison Benningtion and the subsequent resignations from the party after her successful election, including her late husbands brother in law and how some have said the late Ian Paisley would be \"turning in his grave\".\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.. that girl may not know Christ died for her,\" she said.\"I do not hate Ms Bennington, I dont know the girl. I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland. The people or Ireland, north, south, east and west, I think are a great people.\"No matter what part of Ireland a person is from.. they are a fellow country man or woman.\"I just wonder why it had to be ided at that time and I think that was the wrong ision. It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder. Baroness Bannside said it was \"very callous\" but pointed to Jesus and how despite all he had done for his people, was crucied.Baroness Bannside said she no longer worships at the Free Presbyterian Church as it would \"leave her open\" instead going to her granddaughters husbands baptist church.\"I just put it away, I dont bother... I live my own live with my own family and I am content to do that,\" she added.\"It was dficult to forgive them but I have to get on.

Notwithstanding their success at the polls, the Brexit Party and fellow travellers only managed to equal the number of votes gained by remainers. And in Northern Ireland the election merely underlined that a majority of people here want to remain in the EU.Read MoreMEPs to earn £, plus expenses for four months’ work...Brexit happens in OctoberEilis OHanlon: Why we should celebrate Northern Ireland having three female MEPsAlban Maginness: Old political certainties well and truly swept away by historic Euro electionEU election results: Diane Dodds, Naomi Long and Martina Anderson are Northern Irelands MEPs amid Alliance vote surgeThat is not to dismiss either Brexit or Alliance who performed magnicently, chiefly by giving voters a clear message on where they stood. For Alliance it showed there is a middle ground between the DUP and Sinn Fein and that it is best placed at this moment to occupy it.Now the action switches to Westminster and the backstabbing free-for-all that will pass as a Tory party leadership campaign. Up to  candidates could take part but it seems inevitable that any winner will have to be a committed Brexiteer.That will be music to the ears of the DUP who will continue to hold the balance of power in Parliament and one Tory leadership candidate, Jeremy Hunt, has already promised to include them in his negotiating team, although why they had not insisted in being on Theresa Mays team in the first instance is a puzzle.The problem for any potential new Prime Minister is that none of the candidates has come up with a feasible alternative to the border backstop which has always been the stumbling block in finding an acceptable exit agreement. Brexit is like Northern Irelands devolution impasse. Everyone knows what the problems are but no one is prepared to compromise to break the logjam. The worry in parochial terms is that the current Stormont talks will run into the ground through lack of interest from Westminster, the DUPs pivotal position in Parliament which will demand a lot of the partys energies, and Sinn Feins soul searching after poor election performances in the Republic and a less than glowing effort on this side of the border.Meanwhile, the UK has to leave the EU by Halloween at the latest, a ghoulish prospect given that many of the Tory leadership candidates are avowed leave at any cost purists."},{"url":null,"title":"eilis ohanlon why we should celebrate northern ireland having three female meps","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it comes to grasping at straws, that surely takes some beating.Its hard to argue that Alliance has bagged top boasting rights. Naomi Long more than doubled the Alliance vote, attracting , extra first preferences than Anna Lo did when she stood for the party back in , and the party has become the first to describe itself neither as unionist nor nationalist to take a European Parliament seat for the constituency.Some people will deny that last part. There are always conspiracy theorists on the farther edges of either political tradition who claim to know what Alliance \"really\" stands for.It also remains to be seen whether the results represent a permanent sht away from sectarian politics or just a recalibration of the centre. Another low turn out suggests voters here dont give EU elections that high a priority, even after three years of scare stories about the effect of a no-deal Brexit. The Remain vote only went up fractionally on the  referendum.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetWhats definitely historic is that the three MEPs sent to represent Northern Ireland in Brussels are all women, a detail which, to be honest, I hadnt even noticed until it was pointed out to me. That makes two things worth celebrating. The first is the increasing prominence of female representatives in a society which has been male-dominated for too long. The second is that their presence has become so familiar that its becoming possible to not even pay close attention to their gender.Some might wonder whether the female politicians in Northern Ireland are that much of an improvement on the men. The current impasse at Stormont has been presided over by the DUPs Arlene Foster, Sinn Feins Michelle ONeill and a female Secretary of State after all.That is to miss the point - and those who champion the entry of more women into politics often miss it most spectacularly.Alexandra De La Torre is coordinator of the womens peace project the Next Chapter. Last month she said that the real question to ask about the growing number of female politicians in Northern Ireland is: \"Are they representing all women  Or are they representing the male-oriented politics of their political parties \"With respect, that isnt the \"real\" question at all. Its not womens job to clean up the political sphere, any more than its their job to clean the house. It doesnt matterwomen make anything better. Women have every right to be as useless at politics as the men who came before them.What matters is that theyre there at all, which is why every woman who wins an election represents another small victory, not least in Northern Ireland, where, those totemic leadership roles aside, theyre still in a minority politically.There is something to be said for the argument that having female leaders masks the fact that women still dont have a strong enough voice, but part of the problem is the belief that women have \"a voice\" when the truth is they have lots of voices. Too often women in public le are told that they must say and believe certain things in order to earn respect, especially from other women who call themselves feminists, but whose feminism mainly seems to consist of telling other women what to think and haranguing them when they refuse. Feminists who still think the \"wrong\" sort of women are winning elections are just as guilty of doing down women as the misogynists who think the corridors of power are no place for a woman.Whats refreshing is that the three women who now speak for Northern Ireland at EU level are standing there on their own merits and on the s of their respective parties, rather than playing the \"female card\". They each see their role, rightly, as to represent everyone in Northern Ireland.That theyre all so dferent, in character and background and attitude, is noteworthy too. Diane Dodds was a teacher Naomi Long, an engineer Martina Anderson... well, lets just say she was out of the job market for a long time.When it comes to Brexit and the Union and other issues, their views span the whole spectrum of opinion. To give one example, Diane Dodds is opposed to any attempt to dilute the law on abortion Naomi Long believes that terminations should be decriminalised and made available in cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality, but does not support extending the  Abortion Act fully to Northern Ireland Sinn Fein wants abortion liberalised immediately along the lines of the Republic. That seems broadly representative of views across Northern Ireland.There are other dferences too. Diane Dodds is from a rural background the other two grew up in the city, one in Belfast, one in Derry. Anderson is also the only one of the three to have blown up a furniture store in her teenage years, whilst Naomi Long found minor fame as a schoolgirl by appearing on the quiz show Blockbusters. Readers must decide for themselves which was the more admirable adolescent pastime.The important thing is that they are all distinct politically in ways that have little to do with their gender.As it happens, theyre unlikely to get a chance to take up their seats in the European Parliament anyway. The Tories have been so spooked by the rise of the Brexit Party that the new prime minister will feel bound to get the country out of the EU by the October  deadline rather than face another general election. All three seats were filled by women here for the first time, but it was probably also the last time. Just let no one say that the achievement is any less symbolic for that."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38157324.ece/226c8/AUTOCROP/w620/EUROPESum6.jpg","title":"foster wants compromise after varadkar calls on government to recognise northern ireland support for remain and backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Hotels currently have a wage content of around % of turnover.\"The sector has a iety of roles from entry level at the appropriate national minimum wage level of the candidate through to supervisory, management and executive roles.\"The Federation has not seen the evidence that the LPC received last week and therefore is not in a position to answer the specics. Nor have the NIHF been made aware of working conditions contra to current national minimum wage levels by any trade union official or employee in the Derry-Londonderry area.\"Ms Gault added: \"Allegations of this nature are very damaging and without having specic examples are impossible to abate.\"As an industry we have done much to improve our image: improving working hours, providing strong and well rewarded career paths and supporting qualications that give employees the opportunity to have greater skills to work globally.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Niall McCarroll, chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council, and members of Aegis in meeting with the Low Pay Commission."},{"url":null,"title":"foyle hospice weekly draw results winner","story":"Winners in this weeks Foyle Hospice Weekly Draw are - st prize: £,, Paul Breslinnd prize: £,, Rollover : rd prize: £, Terry Monaghanth prize: £, Diarmuid Campbellth prize: £, William Linton .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"new mayor says bishops castle is gem of a town","story":"New Mayor of Bishops Castle Julie Magill, with the mayorrsquos consort, Sue Saltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtlisbury, and the depltspan classtruncate-full-screengtuty mayor, Grant Perry.

Some say while those carrying out the work are obliging, they are not responsible the delay or the lack of communication.Businesses are also hoping that customers they have not seen for some time willwhen Irish Street s to a sense of normality.They say the loss of parking spaces has impacted on trade with the work forcing people not to use one of the townrsquos main car parks nearby.During last weekrsquos protest, one trader revealed that her business has been forced to go mobile, visiting the homes of elderly people who cannot safely access her premises in the town centre due to the public realm scheme.Restaurant owner Mizba Uddin says things have been ldquoterrible for his business since work on the project began.ldquoThe business has literally collapsed, he declared, standing outside his restaurant surrounded by barriers used by contractors.ldquoThe situation is very, very bad and we have even have people driving down the one-way system the wrong way. Parking spaces have been lost as a result of the work and not all will be ed when the scheme is completed. People are going where as we do not provide a delivery service.Mizba said one of his main concerns has been the lack of communication from those overseeing the project. He also urged those in charge of the scheme to talk to traders to let them know what is going on.He added: ldquoI was told that the scheme would end in March and have heard nothing since. I am relying on other people to tell me what is going on but it should not be like this. I cannot even clean my windows because there is so much dust everywhere.ldquoSummer time can be quiet for me. Everyone in Irish Street wants this project completed as quickly as possible. As the work continues, there are simply no customers going to any of the shops. The work is killing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget woman’s two week walk meeting inspirational people  ","story":"A BALLYGALGET woman is one of two volunteers who are spending a fortnight walking in towns and villages around Northern Ireland meeting inspirational people who are improving their communities.Patricia Fleming, a former camogie player with Ballygalget John Mitchelrsquos GAC, called into her old club last Sunday accompanied by Rory Mullan from Derry.They were hand-picked from a raft of candidates to be Big Lunch walkers for this year.Starting last Friday, they are visiting dferent places in Northern Ireland ahead of the Big Lunch weekend on June -.The Big Lunch event is where over six million people through the UK will meet to share food and eat together.Patricia and Rory visited Ballygalget to hear about all the great work the club does in the surrounding area.Patricia, who now lives in Belfast with her family, told the club how its community work was inspiring.ldquoThe reason I picked Ballygalget is that Irsquom from here, Irsquove played on that pitch many times, but I also know the community spirit that exists within Ballygalget. It blows me away when I come home and hear all the things that are happening.ldquoWhen I went for my interview after applying to be one of the Big Lunch walkers, I said thatI was chosen I would like to bring the Big Lunch community walk into rural areas and to Ballygalget.ldquoPeople here are very community oriented. That is not the case everywhere. A lot of people donrsquot feel able to knock on their neighboursrsquo doors.The club hosted a Big Breakfast fundraiser on Sunday towards sending the clubrsquos U- boys and girls to next monthrsquos Feile in Cork.However, the club is also trying to gather support for a huge number of projects, including cross-community work and is also going to host its own event over the Big Lunch weekend.A new cross-community gym opened in the club grounds a year ago, which has proven immensely popular with all sorts of people in the local area, including many who had no links with the GAC.The new building also has space for social workshops and some of the wider community schemes the club wants to pursue.Last year, Ballygalget won an Alzheimerrsquos Society Diversity Award for its work in the community.Club member Roisin Coulter said: ldquoWe are working to become a dementia-friendly community. The idea is to educate people about dementia: what are the signs and symptoms, and how to support someone living with the condition.ldquoEvery month we run a free two-hour workshop, with materials supplied by the Alzheimerrsquos Society.ldquoOur club is very much affected by dementia. Quite a number of people in the club are living with a diagnosis within their families. We want to reduce stigma and the social isolation people can feel.Aoe Savage, Ballygalget GACrsquos Health Club Officer, added: ldquoWe are working against social isolation within our area.ldquoWe are trying to improve health and wellbeing ndash both physical and mental health ndash of people who live nearby, on a cross-community basis.Ballygalget was the walkersrsquo third stop on their tour around Northern Ireland. They have already visited Belfast and Balmoral Show.Over the next two weeks will visit other places including Lisnaskea, Portadown, Ballymoney and Derry.There is still plenty of time to sign up at www.edenprojectcommunities thebiglunchhomepage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Businessman calls for work to be completed quickly  ","story":"IRISH Street businessman Darren Trainor said the public realm scheme needs to be completed quickly for the benefit of everyone in the town.He saidthose in charge of the scheme told traders that they planned to deploy more men to finish it earlier they would put up with the disruption for a just a little longer.And asking for businesses to be provided with up-to-date information, Mr Trainor appealed to those in charge ldquocome and talk to us.He continued: ldquoWe received a letter informing us that the work would be completed on March .

The video was well received and no doubt there will be more versions in the future.Bruce Grobbelaar then rose, to a rapturous reception to deliver one of the slickest and wittiest after dinner speeches the club has heard.Stories from his early days as a  year old lsquokeeper with Highlanders FC, a Zimbabwean football club based in Bulawayo, to an eventual move to Vancouver Whitecaps and subsequent transfer to Crewe Alexandria until the legendary Bob Paisley signed him for Liverpool in .Grobbelaar played  times for the Reds in a trophy-laden career. Among the stories he told were e the events of May , , when his antics in a penalty shoot out against Roma helped Liverpool to win the European Cup.He also talked about his career after Liverpool and working with Alan Ball at Southampton at the height of the match fixing allegations that were made against him.When Ball was asked by the media why he was playing Grobbelaar in goal ahead of England international Dave Beasant, Ball reputedly said: ldquoI would rather have Bruce in goal trying to throw the game than Dave doing his best to save it.By common consensus, Bruce was one of the best speakers the club has had and has whetted the appetite for the future to renew the clubrsquos tradition of bringing over guest speakers.Bruce was presented with a small gt from the club by youth team coach Simon Thornton, a set of golf balls and towel from the Royal County Down Golf Club.Club secretary Andy Hall then spoke for a few minutes to highlight some of the highs and lows of the last  years and to thank IFA regional development officer Seamus Heath for all the work he does in promoting football across the Newry Mourne and Down Council area.Andy then invited IFA vice-chairman Jack Grundie to say a few words with Jack presenting the club with a gt to mark the occasion.County Antrim FA president Jim Jess also spoke warmly about the club and presented a memento to mark the occasion with Maurice Johnston, vice chair of the Mid Ulster Football League, congratulating the club on their th anniversary and presenting Tollymore chairman John McIlvenny with a gt to recognise the achievement.Newcastle League secretary Alan Craig was unfortunately taken ill before the dinner and was unable to attend and the club sends its warm wishes to him for a speedy recovery.The final official speaker was Elaine Junk, the former chair of the NI Womenrsquos Football Association during the period when Tollymore had a successful ladiesrsquo side.Elaine congratulated the club on its th anniversary and encouraged them to get a ladiesrsquo team back up and playing.With the official proceedings drawing to a close there was one last surprise with Adrian Howard presenting a le time achievement award on behalf of players and members to Andy Hall in recognition of all his work for the club.It was a wonderful gesture by the club and much appreciated by Andy.The evening concluded with dancing to the wonderful Fth Avenue with Bruce continuing to sign autographs and pose for pictures into the wee small hours..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Locals flying high in F15 championship  ","story":"ROGER Chamberlain and Charlie Horder won the Northern Ireland Flying Fteen Championship on Strangford Lough at the weekend.It was a deserved triumph for the Whiterock duo and also for Strangford Sailing Club, which hosted the event less than a month after the re-opening of its clubhouse which was gutted by an accidental fire in September .The five-race championship attracted a -strong fleet, which included a sizeable contingent of southern visitors, mainly from Dun Laoghaire.After three races on Saturday Chamberlain and Horder were in third place, behind Killyleagh pair Andrew McCleery and Colin Dougan mdash who got off to a flyer by winning the opening race mdash and overnight leaders Brian McKee and John Gibson, also from Whiterock, who were second and seventh in the first two races before winning the final race of the day.Chamberlain and Horder came out of the blocks early on Sunday and comfortably won the fourth race before sealing the championship with fth place in the final race.McKee and Gibson were a disappointing th in the fourth race, but with the discard brought into play, they still had a chance of outright victory.

beyond his power’ in Loughinisland report  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos Police Ombudsman went beyond his legal powers in publishing a report ldquoreplete with determinations that RUC officers colluded with loyalists in the Loughinisland massacre, the Court of Appeal heard last week.Lawyers for two retired senior policemen claimed the watchdogrsquos damning findings on the Loughinisland atrocity should only have been releasedit had recommended prosecutions or disciplinary action against any of those under scrutiny.Judgment was reserved in the renewed bid by Raymond White and Ronald Hawthorne to have the report quashed.UVF gunmen opened fire at the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, Co Down as their victims watched a World Cup football match in June .The men killed were: Adrian Rogan , Malcolm Jenkinson , Barney Green , Daniel McCreanor , Patrick OrsquoHareand Eamon Byrne .Five others were also wounded in a sectarian attack for which no-one has been brought to justice.In June  the Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, said collusion between some officers and the loyalists was a signicant feature in the murders.He found no evidence police had prior knowledge, but identied ldquocatastrophic failings in the investigation.Mr White, representing the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officersrsquo Association, and Mr Hawthorne, a former sub-isional police commander, have been involved in a long-running legal challenge to the published findings.A first hearing resulted in a ruling in  that the report was procedurally unfair and had failed to make clear it conclusions did not apply to Mr Hawthorne.At that time the watchdog agreed to remove any references to him to ensure he is not connected to any alleged wrongdoing mdash a move seen as complete vindication for the former police commander.A limited re-hearing before a dferent judge focused only on issues around the extent of the powers to publish the findings.In November last year a High Court judge rejected the retired officersrsquo case that Dr Maguire had exceeded his legal remit.Mr White and Mr Hawthorne are now now appealing that ruling.The former policemenrsquos barrister, David McMillen QC, stressed their complete support for the Ombudsmanrsquos role in scrutinising and holding officers to account.He argued, however, that the watchdog lacked the legislative authority to publish such ldquoconclusive findings in the Loughinisland report.ldquoHe simply does not have that power, Mr McMillen said.ldquoThis is an organ of the state, an important and very public organ of the state finding police officers guilty.Askedhe believed the Ombudsmanrsquos report had concluded police officers may have committed criminal offences, Mr McQuillen replied: ldquoIt was replete with those suggestions.But Mr McMillen rejected suggestions that the document could be amended to state there ldquomay be evidence of criminal or disciplinary offences.ldquoThe report is so infected with conclusive language all the way through, about what he found, that a simple rider would not make sense, he said.Barra McGrory QC, for the Ombudsman, countered that the legislation allowed him to

households  ","story":"A PROVINCE-WIDE recycling survey carried out last month has claimed that one third of householders in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area were unhappy with how the local authority had asked them to recycle.The survey mdash carried out by polling and market research organisation Lucid Talk mdash revealed that only % of those surveyed would recycle when it was convenient for them.The survey revealed that of those who said they would recycle only when it was convenient, % indicated that they would be encouraged to recycle morethere was one bin that took all recycling, including glass mdash a service that until last month was unavailable in the former Down Council area.In addition, the survey showed that where the council area could lsquocomminglersquo glass in the same bin with the rest of their household recyclables mdash plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard etc mdash householders were on average % happy with their glass collection method, compared to % of those in council areas that did not.Re-Gen Waste Ltd managing director, Joseph Doherty, said the survey results indicated that prioritising simplicity and convenience was the best approach to ensuring a high level of household recycling.He continued: ldquoSince April , glass can now be commingled with household recycling waste in the Down legacy council area, meaning that all householders across Newry, Mourne and Down can now put their glass into their blue bins.ldquoWe should see an marked improvement in recycling figures and a decrease in the percentage of glass placed in black bins across the entire council area.Mr Doherty said local authorities need to encourage the maximum number of people to recycle the maximum volume of materials, weighed against the cost of processing the material, and the potential financial benefits from reducing landfill costs, and selling on recyclable material.ldquoThe councils we with work in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland tell us that household friendly schemes such as commingling recyclables, plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard and glass in one bin, are much preferable to residents than any pre-sort scheme using smaller containers or bins and that it is actively improving their recycling rates, he said.Last March, of the households in the Newry, Mourne and Down area that could commingle their glass with their recyclables in the same bin, % of respondents said they would recycle lessthey had to separate their household waste, including glass waste into separate caddies.Mr Doherty added: ldquoMore and more local authorities are seeing the benefits and cost savings achieved by switching to commingling collection services, alongside an ultra-modern Materials Recycling Facilitylike ours that receives, separates and prepares recyclables for productive use where.The Lucid Talk survey was carried out across all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district council

Kielty has called for an end to the segregation of education along religious lines in Northern Ireland.He believes that someone like Good Friday Agreement peace talks chairman George Mitchell could be the man tasked with the job of overhauling the countryrsquos ldquoided schools.At an Ulster University event in Belfast last week focusing on sectarianism, the Dundrum man said the segregated education issue needed to be addressed.He also criticised what he described as the ldquocasual sectarianism and ldquotribalism which characterises parts of society.He continued: ldquoI think we really have to address education, segregated education and I think that as a society we kind of have to start calling out that casual sectarianism.ldquoWhenever we had peace here we thoughtwe move on to a Glaswegian level of sectarianism that is fine, so we only hate each other every week when we go to football. That is not good enough. The tribalism of that is not good enough.The comedian also suggested that the integrated education term was ldquoinsulting.He explained: ldquoAround the rest of the world that is called education. What we have in this country is segregated education.The Dundrum man also paid tribute to the ldquobrilliant work of teachers but said people felt those high standards were enough and did not tackle the underlying ision.ldquoThe natural  of mixing and realising that we are exactly the same and having a school that has got a rugby team and a GAA team, you donrsquot have to go to that schoolyou like GAA. There are just certain things that we really need to have a look at and I am not sure that we are necessarily ready for it.Speaking at the Belfast event, Mr Kielty argued that changing the education system would have to be done by an international figure like former US senator George Mitchell.ldquoOnce we actually get through it we will go, lsquogee why didnrsquot we do that before now rsquo, but it is a dficult one, he conceded, suggesting that social media is contributing to the lack of exposure to dferent views.ldquoYour own opinion is folded back into yourself on the screen every day, he said. ldquoMore than ever, we actually have to put the screen down and make an effort to realise that we are the same.ldquoWe talk too much about dference here. You are either a British person living on the island of Ireland or you are an Irish person who is currently actually in the UK. You are actually a bit of both.Mr Kielty added: ldquoThe minute that we accept that that is going to move in a fluid way, and it is perfectly fine to be a bit of both, that is kind of where we need to be.Meanwhile, the charity which has been working for almost three decades to bridge the gap between starting integrated schools and securing full government support has welcomed Ulster University proposals for a concerted effort in Northern Ireland to eradicate sectarianism.The university, supported by the Sir George Quigley Fund, launched lsquoSectarianism in Northern Ireland: a Reviewrsquo at a conference at the UUrsquos Belfast campus last week.The Integrated Education Fundmdash which was established in  mdash praised the conference for addressing the issue and welcomed Patrick Kieltyrsquos comments that educating all children together is the way forward for a shared future.The review contains more than  proposals for how bodies including government, business, education, youth services, arts and sport could work collectively over a sustained period of time to foster greater collaboration and understanding across communities.As well suggesting that a government department should be established specically to tackle sectarianism, the researchers propose establishing a new civic body to help shape community efforts toward reconciliation.IEF chief executive Tina Merron said the organisation ldquoshares the vision, held by the overwhelming majority of citizens, of a united community and a shared future.Ms Merron said that at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there were , pupils in  integrated schools, compared with more than , attending  integrated schools today.She said that with no government plan for integrated education, the growth was down to ldquodetermined campaigners and pioneering parents.She added: ldquoWe see a reformed education system as an essential ingredient of this future an education system which brings children, staff and governors from Catholic and Protestant traditions, as well as those of other faiths or none and of other cultures, together in schools, an education system which recognises and respects ersity and ensures that all young people feel confident and welcome in their school environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein’s Casey chosen as district’s first citizen  ","story":"SINN Feinrsquos Charlie Casey is Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos new chairman.The Newry politicianrsquos appointment was confirmed at the local authorityrsquos annual meeting on Monday night when he succeeded the SDLPrsquos Mark Murnin as the districtrsquos first citizen.The new council vice-chairman is Rowallane SDLP councillor Terry Andrews, who succeeded Sinn Feinrsquos Oksana McMahon, who represented the Crotlieve area but lost her seat in the recent local government election.The new chairman was presented with his chain of office by his predecessor, who also losthis Slieve Croob seat at the recent election.The new first citizen said he was delighted to be nominated for the position by his party and hoped to do the position justice, urging all councillors to unite to protect services under the threat in the council area, particularly those in relation to the health and welfare of all, in particular, the most vulnerable.Cllr Casey also took time to thank Mr Murnin and Mrs McMahon for their work over the past year and the other councillors who were not ing to the council following the election.Addressing members as chairman for the first time, Cllr Casey urged them to fight for lesaving and le-changing services, champion the cause of equality and take forward the councilrsquos commitment of putting the organisation at the heart of everything it does.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos mission is to lead and serve the district as a prosperous and healthy area and ensure it is sustainable from an economic, environmental and social perspective.

The evidence of recent elections points convincingly to this.A diminishing voter base is now a trend, more likely to continue than not. Unionist voters are tired of Lambeg politics and fabric loyalism when the real focus should be on issues relating to economy, health provision, and creating a shared Northern Ireland based on equality, respect and accountable government through the full implementation of Good Friday strands.That voters, who may in the past have voted for unionist parties, are now walking away cannot be addressed through unionist unity which – in spite of local spats, personal animosities between the main two unionist parties, and minimal policy dferences – is de facto in existence.Hence, the recent comment of a fairly senior and long-standing UUP representative that he, a member, finds it dficult to tell the dference between his party and the DUP.What chance then for the voter who, whilst pro-Union, wants a more inclusive, ethical and relevant civic and consensual unionism than is currently on offer This is especially the requirement of younger voters who identy as unionist with a smaller ‘u’ than previous generations and now prioritize creating a peaceful and erse community where harmonious relationships are not discouraged by cookie-cutter labels and continuous glances to the past.Many across the generations want the same but are continually disappointed by unionist political representatives who promise much but pledge their primary allegiance to old quarrels and narrow ideology.An old order can crumble very quickly.Political unionism would do well to heed the words of Whig constitutionalist, Thomas Macauley: “reform that you may preserve”.Terry Wright, former UUP vice-chairman , LondonderryJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"spectre of liberalism now has right wingers on the run in ni too  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Offbeat People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           lsquoSpectrersquo of liberalism now has right-wingers on the run ndash in NI tooAlliance Party leader Naomi LongPublished::Wednesday  May Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Columnists\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

Unprecedented. Labour and Conservatives outvoted by Lib Dems in England. Unprecedented.Anti-sectarian Alliance Party has taken one of Northern Ireland’s three European Parliament seats from the UUP. Unprecedented.Stephen Douglas, Alliance PartyThe UK anti-Brexit and pro-EU parties easily outpolled those still unambiguously in favour of a hard Brexit.Now the UK government, understandably wary of not fulfilling the people’s wishes expressed three years ago, should become even warier of ramming through a isive Brexit on % of current electoral support.For the past while we’ve been hearing of the rise of the populist right across the entire western democratic world.The spectre I’m now noticing clear as day is the persistence of multi-cultural, transnational, liberal, tolerant, equal rights-driven democratic rhetoric. Brexit, sure, has upended and disrupted decades of entrenched so-called tribal politics in Northern Ireland, with nationalist Sinn Fein calling on its supporters to give second preferences to a pro-EU party that could win .Yes, I understand that the UK government’s continuance depends on the anti-progressive, anti-equal marriage DUP whose hard Brexit anti-EU and anti-Backstop stance has alienated many of its relatively recently-acquired electoral base of pro-business, and suburban electors.But I sense an alternative force gathering power: the strength of open, internationalist politics personied by the recent electoral successes of pro-EU political parties demonstrates its abiding attraction to huge swathes of our neighbours, old, young, British, Irish, or neither.Meanwhile in Ireland, last Friday’s referendum on orce got a thumping +% majority in favour of loosening constitutional constraints on orce. This seems like the final nail in the coffin of old Ireland which has now voted by huge majorities in recent years to introduce equal marriage rights, orce and in favour of the right to choose for women contemplating abortion.A traditionalist culture war that began with Irish independence has now been finally won by progressive, pro-European, outward looking forces.Yet those on the winning side in this battle must neither evince triumphalism nor complacency that such changes are irreversible or that they won’t stimulate counter measures.In the UK, Brexit’s impact seems now but one provincial manestation of a much wider post- financial crisis realignment in European politics.Ben Lowry: The Northern Ireland MEP election results were bad, almost disastrous, for the unionist parties Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The signs are clear from recent elections in the UK and where that the anti-incumbent, anti-establishment sentiment ruthlessly appropriated in the UK by establishment figures like the European Research Group, Brexiteers, and Nigel Farage is now being reappropriated by internationalists.The signs are there that this evolving post-Brexit referendum re-alignment will not lead inexorably to some ultimate victory for far-right, Stephen Bannon’ite, religious conservative, pro-“family values”, hedge funded traditionalist reactionaries like Salvini-Le Pen-Farage’ista anti-progressive forces.Instead, a resilient progressive, pro- transnational, pro-EU victory for those professing unashamedly, ruthlessly well organised, genuinely positive and optimistic, pro-multicultural, pro-equality and pro-Green rhetorical agendas has come into view.En marche, indeed.• Stephen Douglas was general secretary of the Alliance Party in -JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"tuv man unionism is lacking a centre ground weakening it  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Offbeat People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           TUV man: unionism is lacking a centre ground, weakening itLetter to the editorRichard Cairns Published::Wednesday  May Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Letters\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

Since the decision taken by the whole of the UK to leave the EU in , there has been much focus on Northern Ireland and the issue of the backstop. The question for those seeking a second referendum or a confirmatory vote on any deal is this – has there been any quantiable change in voter intention from  ‘til now In Northern Ireland, of all the candidates saying they respected the decision to Leave their percentage share of the vote was .%. For those wanting to remain it was .%.With an almost % decrease in turnout compared to the referendum, it indicates to me that minds have not been changed – and with a similar pattern in the rest of the UK, it looks asthe ision runs just as deep.Indeed, anecdotally, many leave supporters boycotted this election as they did not want to legitimise it by voting, as it should not have been taking place.Political unionism has suffered in this election – however, there was no ‘remain’ option on the table for a pro-union voter [Danny Kennedy had voted remain in , but on Thursday stood on a ticket of wanting a ‘sensible Brexit’].It is evident that this has hurt the UUP, with a section of their core voting for a remain candidate, most likely Alliance.It also alludes to a strategic weakness within the wider unionist family – it is not representative enough and there is no release valve in the centre ground.On the upside, the transfer rate across unionist candidates was excellent and this is to be commended and followed in future elections.The default reaction at times of uncertainty within unionism is this urge for unionist unity. Unity will not preserve the union – understanding that maximising the total unionist vote and extolling the benefits of the union to all people in Northern Ireland will do that. In order to do that you need pro-union parties, distinct from each other, reaching out and representing all facets of society.That is both the challenge and opportunity for all pro-union parties.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The garden has been created by staff and contractors from housebuilders Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes.The custom design incorporates traditional elements of earth, wind, fire and air, and has been purpose-built for the school.Ysgol Y Deri supports a erse range of pupils with specialist needs from ages three to .Rhys Jones said: ldquoItrsquos absolutely phenomenal. Having this facility for all ages and abilities is something that I wish I had when I was younger.ldquoIrsquove been asked to open the garden and Irsquom honoured to be at the school. Irsquove read up a little about it and what theyrsquore doing is outstanding.Caroline Williams, headteacher of primary at Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoThe dedication and hard work of all the volunteers was incredible under dficult conditions, with lots of clay and concrete to dig through. The space was sad and neglected before and now is interesting, welcoming and inviting truly a space for all our learners to explore their senses. The pupils loved exploring it for the first time on Saturday during the official opening.ldquoWe canrsquot thank the teams enough who have brought this project together Barratt David Homes and their volunteers for the financial support and labour, Dunn Landscapes who managed the work daily, Pam Creed for her design and Pughrsquos Garden centre for the donation of the plants, as well as KidsOut for the donation of the musical instruments.Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes managing director Steve Williams said: ldquoEveryone at Barratt gets a day off to volunteer for a charity. So we looked for a project that we could all do together to really make a dference. From the company  people volunteered to work on the project. Itrsquos fair to say we all got a lot out of it. It really warms our hearts to see what wersquove been able to do in four weeks.Blisse Mellons, , and her mother Laura were already using the gardens. ldquoShe likes this one a lot. She likes to scratch stuff, said Mrs Mellons. ldquoItrsquos good for the wheelchairs and itrsquos a great height.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed.

It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions. Our customers value our expertise and the ability to meet up in person to discuss financial plans.  What makes your business stand out from the competition  There are numerous competitors in the marketplace, but we are the biggest private banking relationship management team in Northern Ireland. Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.

I’ve heard employers bemoan the fact that this generation can’t communicate face-to-face or they place more emphasis on their passions outside of work than their own career development.While some of this is no doubt grounded in their experience, employers perhaps need to adjust how they engage with the new generation beyond just offering them quirky perks and trendy working environments. Hays recently sponsored The GoodIdea, the biggest ever AI hackathon in NI organised by AINIand Hackily – a two-day event hosted by QUB School of Computing and Ulster University Magee campus for around  hackers in Belfast and  in Derry.The hackathon provided a welcoming and collaborative environment for hackers to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI under a theme of ‘AI for good’, where hackers were challenged to utilise open data sources to create an innovative solution to a real-world problem.It was an opportunity for students – who made up % of the attendees – and experienced professionals to meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.Far from being underwhelmed by Generation Z, we were inspired by the talent pools from dferent backgrounds such as computer science, physics and maths, coming together to collaborate with each other, learn about bleeding edge technologies and also to put their skills to use in creating something that was a benefit to society. For example, one of the teams invented an algorithm for a computer to read British sign language using a webcam.These were ambitious, driven, competitive young people who worked brilliantly in their teams and certainly didn’t struggle to communicate, eventhey arrived alone and joined a team. A team from Glasgow made the journey across to take part and the hackathon ran right through Saturday night – so we couldn’t fault their work ethic.There were prizes, mentorship and funding available to the winners of the hackathon, as well as recruitment advice and workshops provided to students and professionals by Hays’ own experts across software development, data engineering and cyber security.But the main attraction was undoubtedly in the opportunity to co-create new ideas about how to apply technology to the world they will run in future. That is hugely positive and our challenge as employers must be to make sure the students who will be the candidates of the future in NI’s thriving tech community are encouraged to put that passion into their careers.The undergraduate community is an under-served community of future leaders in terms of recruitment and our desire is to equip undergraduates with the right understanding of what employers in the tech sector want and how they can build their personal brand for the future.Employers need to get past the myths about Generation Z and focus on helping younger employees find meaning in their workthey are to unlock their potential.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged.
