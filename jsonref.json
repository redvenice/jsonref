Bush.In the United States, more rural areas tend to favor the Republican Party while more urban, erse areas typically favor the Democratic Party.When are the 2018 midterm elections?The 2018 midterm elections will be held on Tuesday, November 6.          The election will soon have a major impact on political issues like taxes, immigration and moreSenateThe Republicans currently hold a narrow 51 seat majority in the Senate and are facing strong headwinds, though have one clear advantage: the Democrats will be on the defensive. The Democratic Party is currently defending 26 seats while the Republican Party is only defending nine, possibly giving them an edge going into the election.The Senate will see a number of key elections to watch closely as the 2018 midterms draw near.One key race is in Arizona for the seat held by the late Senator John McCain, which is currently being targeted by the Democrats for a potential pickup. Republican candidate Martha McSally is thought to face a tough challenge from Democratic candidate Kyrsten Sinema.The state’s shifting demographics, notably its large and growing Latino population, and isions between traditional Republicans like McCain and pro-Trump populists have threatened to weaken the Republicans’ long-held grip on the state.Other key Senate races to keep an eye on include a surprisingly competitive race between sitting Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke, who only narrowly trails Cruz according to most polls in the traditionally-Republican state.In Nevada, Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Dean Heller are locked in a tight race, as are Republican Josh Hawley and Democrat Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Democrat Phil Bredesen and Republican Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee, another traditionally-Republican state.In Florida, one of the most famous bellwether states in the U.S., the race between Democrat Bill Nelson and Rick Scott is also extremely competitive.House of RepresentativesThough the Republicans currently control the House of Representatives, the Democrats are seen as having a strong chance to retake the congressional chamber, needing 24 seats to gain majority control of it.Republicans currently hold 240 seats compared to 195 for the Democrats.However, over the past 50 years, the Democrats have only gained more than 24 seats twice: in 1974, in the wake of the infamous Watergate scandal, and in 2006, when opposition to former President George W. Bush over the Iraq War reached a fever pitch.Fortunately for the Democrats, a record 39 sitting Republicans in the House of Representatives have opted to not seek reelection, giving them a chance to pick up seats in many states, including longtime swing states like Pennsylvania and Florida.A key race to watch closely is in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, where Democrat Conor Lamb stunned observers to win a special election in March 2018 for a seat that had been held by Republicans from 2003 to 2017 and was considered to be in Trump-friendly territory.Lamb will now be facing off against Republican Keith Rothfus after court-ordered redistricting in a new district that’s thought to be considerably friendlier to the Democrats.          Democrat Beto O\u0027Rourke is putting up a very strong challenge against Texas Senator Ted Cruz GovernorsKey races are also slated to get underway at the gubernatorial level as Democrats and Republicans face off in key swing states like Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Colorado.Republicans currently hold 33 governorships, although the Democrats are looking to build on their anticipated momentum and make gains at the state level as well as in Congress.A key race to watch is in Florida, as Democrat Andrew Gillum, fresh off an upset victory in the primaries, is looking to become the first African-American to become governors of the state. The outspoken progressive and Tallahassee mayor will face off against Republican Representative Ron DeSantis, a vocal proponent of Donald Trump’s policies.Other notable races to watch closely include competitive elections in Georgia, where Democrat Stacy Abrams is looking to become the first African-American woman to win a gubernatorial race in the U.S. as she faces off against Republican Brian Kemp and in the swing state of Iowa, where Republican Kim Reynolds is locked in a tight battle with Democrat Fred Hubbell.2018 midterm election predictionsThough the 2018 midterm election is still several weeks away, both historical and current trends have helped pollsters and election prognosticators draw up what they believe is a likely scenario for the outcome of the election.Given the fact that the sitting President’s party generally loses seats in midterm elections and President Donald Trump is hobbled by fairly low approval ratings, many election forecasters believe that the upcoming election will produce strong results for the Democrats and favor them taking at least one house of Congress, both of which are currently controlled by the Republicans.According to FiveThirtyEight, the Senate has a more than 67 percent chance to remain in Republican hands as of September 17. This is largely due to the fact that the Democrats have to defend a much wider range of seats during the election, including ones in states won by Trump in the 2016 election.Having to defend so many seats could blunt the ‘blue wave’ that many election forecasters have predicted for the Democrats and possibly leave the Senate in Republican control, though many races are thought to be especially competitive and could easily swing one way or another.The Democrats are thought to have much better odds in the House of Representatives, where FiveThirtyEight is forecasting the Democrats’ chances of retaking the chamber of more than 82 percent as of September 17.Although the Republicans currently have a solid majority of 240 seats, the Democrats have a clear historical advantage and are also buoyed by strong and persistent opposition to Trump, meaning that their odds of retaking the chamber are considerably higher than in the Senate.Playing For Keeps: All you need to know about the new Network Ten TV seriesPrince George\u0027s latest obsession revealed by father Prince WilliamNational lottery numbers: Results for Wednesday September 19Julie Chen\u0027s net worth revealed as Les Moonves\u0027s wife confirms she\u0027s staying on as Big Brother hostAmerica\u0027s Got Talent 2018 winner: Who is expected to take home the grand prize?International Talk Like a Pirate Day 2018: All you need to knowWho is Orla Kiely?

I think it\u0027s a combination of both things.Wanda Barzee, 72, is pictured for the FIRST TIME since her...Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 31, exhibits her model figure in...Big Brother: Lewis Gregory can\u0027t hide his delight as he...Share this article\u0027That kind of a message, it might not be for everybody. But there is a group of people for whom that message is designed. And nothing fills my soul more than to think that maybe some kid watching that would say, \u0027Hey, I\u0027ve been thinking about that. I\u0027ve been thinking about praying. Let me try that out.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s like the only way I feel like I can repay what has essentially been a giant gift in my life.\u0027Top honor: On Monday, Chris Pratt, 38, received the MTV Movie \u0026amp TV Generation AwardPratt dismissed the idea that talking so openly about his faith, particularity at a non-religious event, could be a risk in Hollywood. \u0027I think that there\u0027s this narrative that exists out there that Hollywood is anti-Christian or anti-religious, but it\u0027s just not the case,\u0027 he said.\u0027They are kind of not anti-anything. They are kind of pro whatever is authentic to you. \u0027And I like that. Because it\u0027s authentic for me to be pro-Christian, pro-Jesus. That\u0027s my thing. I like it. \u0027And I\u0027ve never had anyone try to shame me, to my face. Maybe they go say it behind my back. But if that\u0027s the case, go ahead. You can say whatever you want about me - to my face or behind my back. I\u0027m not going to change.\u0027Aside from his Christianity, Pratt said that exercise way a major motivator in his life.     The couple that exercise together: Chris Pratt, 39, and girlfriend  Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28, were spotted out for a walk on a sunny Saturday in Los Angeles           Old love: Chris with his wife of eight years, actress Anna Faris, and their son Jack, six , at his Hollywood star ceremony in 2017. They filed for orce last DecemberThe interview with The Associated Press, took place after Michelob Ultra, which Pratt is a spokesman for, announced it was sponsoring seven athletes with disabilities, part of the nonprofit group Achilles International, to run in the New York City Marathon. \u0027It\u0027s hard enough to do a marathon or to do a triathlon. But to do it when you have physical limitations and disabilities, it\u0027s pretty awe-inspiring,\u0027 he said, adding that fitness is \u0027a great common denominator.\u0027The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state, says that he feels he was \u0027genetically made for... moving refrigerators or something.\u0027\u0027But now I\u0027m doing a job that really isn\u0027t that physically demanding. So having something that I can just shut my mind off and do physically every day is good for me.\u0027The Jurassic World actor added that he is a little self-conscious about his running skills, after breaking his leg as a child left one of his legs crooked, and so he was in awe of actors like Tom Cruise who could sprint flawlessly on screen and did their own stunts.\u0027When I run, I run a little crooked. And if I run at top speed, there\u0027s a high likelihood I will fall down,\u0027 he said.\u0027Tom Cruise. \u0027Mission: Impossible\u0027 - he ran across London, across bridges, over buildings. Yeah, Tom is a great runner. He did all his own jumping, he was flying the helicopter, he really was like - oh, if there\u0027s a question of whether or not I\u0027m the best at this, let me put that question to bed. He\u0027s the best.\u0027But it was Cruise\u0027s reputation that Pratt said he most admired.          The 39-year-old actor, who enjoys biking, running and ocean swimming when at his farm in the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state          Pratt has erected crosses on his land \u0027One of the career goals that I have based on Tom Cruise is his reputation as being a really nice, positive guy who works hard. I\u0027ve never actually met him, but I would like - if you\u0027re going to leave a legacy, it\u0027d be nice to have it be that people thought you were nice and easy to work with and you worked hard. I think that\u0027s pretty cool.\u0027Prat split from his wife Anna Faris last year, but has found love again in Katherine Schwarzenegger, 28.They came out as a couple in June and have been spotted enjoying a sunny Saturday day in Los Angeles last weekend.Proving that couple that exercises together stays together, they enjoyed a walk. At one point the beautiful 28-year-old daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and his ex-wife Maria Shriver reached out to lovingly stroke her beau\u0027s arm. Chris and Katherine are reportedly serious, a source dished to People, even though they\u0027ve only been together a few months \u0027They\u0027re both serious about the relationship and hopeful for the future,\u0027 the source revealed. \u0027Chris doesn\u0027t just date to date, and neither does Katherine. She\u0027s very excited.\u0027 They were set up by her mom Maria, according to the source.The actor split from wife Anna Faris in August 2017 after being married for eight years and they share six-year-old son Jack.  He filed for orce on December 1, nearly four months after they announced their legal separation. Three days later Anna filed her nearly identical response. They both cited irreconcilable differences and requested joint legal and physical custody of their son, according to E!

Dixon said her parents were so keen on renovations to her childhood home on the Isle of Man that she \u0027grew up on a building site\u0027. Bühler, meanwhile, used his architectural expertise to draw up the designs. By the end of their work they had a long, open-plan ground floor with a 22ft-wide kitchen-diner area illuminated by two huge skylights and four ceiling-height sliding windows. The kitchen, which like the rest of the property has walnut floors,  features marble worktops and a French range and mirror. Upstairs there are four bathrooms in addition to a downstairs loo.A drafty, non-secured side alley was replaced with a larder and a wine room to take advantage of the cool temperatures in that part of the house.            The couple are pictured with their children, Forest and Vada, further towards the front of the house, which contains the living room in an open-plan format           There are four bathrooms in the upstairs of the house, in addition to a downstairs loo. This bathroom is decorated with several modern artworks, much like many rooms in the property   Dixon and Bühlerand made use of the high 8.2-feet ceilings to lend an airy aspect to the property.

It is a stark contrast to the previous set up of seven bedsits Meanwhile, the previously overgrown backyard with a pond full of frogs has been replaced with a Mediterranean-style garden.The couple met at architecture school and have already renovated several properties in the local area, some of which they rent out.\u0027We are really happy with it, it\u0027s a great space to live in,\u0027 Dixon said. Even though it\u0027s very big each area is zoned to make it more liveable. \u0027So even though the downstairs is vast it is broken up into a reading area, sitting room and kitchen all in their separate little zones.\u0027            The previously overgrown backyard with a pond full of frogs has been replaced with a Mediterranean-style garden          A quiet area in the upstairs of the house, where there used to be a drug den which the couple found strewn with used needles           \u0027There were lots of people living there before,\u0027 Dixon said.

The first section elaborates what the authors call the “Great Untruths” that supposedly dominate college campuses: What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Weaker Always Trust Your Feelings Life Is a Battle Between Good People and Evil People. Their targets are “safetyism”, the language of microaggressions, identity politics and intersectionality. Generation “iGen”, the one that comes after millennials, is, according to the authors, suffering a mental health crisis because of smartphone addiction and the paranoid parenting style of the upper middle class.Their title echoes The Closing of the American Mind, Allan Bloom’s 1987 bestselling attack on the “relativism” that he said threatened the achievements of western civilisation. As if paying homage to Bloom’s love of classics, the new book opens with a pilgrimage to Misoponos, a Greek oracle who serves Koalemos, preaching the three great untruths. This excursion turns out to be a bit of mischief (misoponos means “lazy”, and Koalemos is an obscure god of stupidity). “We didn’t really travel to Greece to discover these three terrible ideas,” the authors reveal. “We didn’t have to.” They did not write this book because of an oracle they wrote it, perhaps, because an article that they published in the Atlantic went viral.The bait and switch might seem like a strange way to begin fighting dogma on behalf of facts. But the “tenured radical” is a long-standing enemy in the culture war industry. Lukianoff and Haidt update the themes of neoconservatives such as Roger Kimball and Dinesh D’Souza, whose 1991 Illiberal Education also first appeared as an Atlantic cover story. But if they are clearly hoping to tap into the forces that made Bloom and his successors bestsellers, this is a repetition with a difference. Rather than Plato they want data. Rather than a canon, they want to preserve mental health. They say health will save democracy.The methods they teach come from cognitive behavioural therapy, which Lukianoff credits with having saved his life when he suffered from depression. He and Haidt argue that student demands for social justice are expressions of “cognitive distortions” that CBT can correct, and that the problems that young people and their parents worry about are not as grave as they think they are simply, as Steven Pinker writes, “problems of progress”. Despite the title, which suggests cultural or civilisational diagnosis, the checklists and worksheets distributed throughout this book make clear that its genre is self-help.The tips it contains may benefit upper middle class parents. They may benefit students from minority or working class backgrounds who arrive on elite campuses to find that, despite good intentions, those campuses have not fully prepared for them. But the framing leaves no room to consider how historical and social change might legitimately change institutions or iniduals, or that iniduals might want to change their world. (This framing also explains how they can write hundreds of pages about what’s wrong with contemporary higher education and not mention debt or adjuncts.) The authors cite the “folk wisdom” “Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child”. They call this attitude “pragmatic”. The prospect that a group of children might get together to build a new road themselves is not one they can countenance.The Coddling of the American Mind is less interesting for its anecdotes or arguments, which are familiar, than as an epitome of a contemporary liberal style. That style wants above all to be reasonable. Lukianoff and Haidt include adverb after adverb to telegraph how well they have thought things through. Following the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a white supremacist drove a car into a crowd of people, killing Heather Heyer, “levels of fear and anger were understandably elevated”. “Members of some identity groups surely face more frequent insults to their dignity than do straight white males.”Elaborate syntactic balancing acts even out at meaninglessness. In a passage likening recent “witch-hunts” on American campuses to atrocities perpetrated during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Lukianoff and Haidt write: “As historical events, the two movements are radically different, most notably in that the Red Guards were responding to the call of a totalitarian dictator, who encouraged them to use violence, while the American college students have been self-organised and almost entirely nonviolent.” Those are big differences! “Yet, there are similarities, too. For instance, both were movements initiated by idealistic young college students.”The point of the style is to signal the distance between the authors and the partisans of identity who are too emotional to think clearly. The fact that Lukianoff and Haidt claim the authority to police discourse becomes clear the first time they discuss the role “overreaction from the right” has played in recent campus wars – at least halfway through the book. They quote death threats that Princeton professor Keeanga Yamahtta-Taylor received in 2017, including “lynching and having the bullet from a .44 Magnum” put in her head. “One might conclude,” Lukianoff and Haidt write, that if she and two other professors who received such threats “had spoken in a more deliberative style, befitting a professor, they would have had no trouble”. Should black female scholars really believe that the lynch mob would leave them alone if they just spoke in a more “reasonable” way?The style that does befit an expert, apparently, is the style of TED talks, thinktanks and fellow Atlantic writers and psychologists. The citations in this book draw a circle around a closed world. In offering a definition of “identity politics”, a term coined by the black socialist lesbians of the Combahee River Collective (and the subject of a recent book edited by Yamahtta-Taylor), Lukianoff and Haidt quote “Jonathan Rauch, a scholar at the Brookings Institution”. They tell their readers to read Pinker, whose fulsome blurb appears on their book jacket.The book ends with a list of recommendations for fixing young people and universities. “We think that things will improve, and may do so quite suddenly at some point in the next few years,” they conclude, suddenly cheery. Why? “As far as we can tell from private conversations, many and perhaps most university presidents reject the culture of safetyism,” even if “they find it politically difficult to say so publicly”. Based on conversations with high school and college students, the authors believe that most of them “despise call-out culture”.“Private conversations” that they cannot describe seem like thin evidence from a social scientist and a lawyer whose motto is “Carpe datum!” A few chapters earlier, they bewail the ethos of “customer service” that has led universities to coddle students, but here they are confident that “if a small group of universities is able to develop a different sort of academic culture … market forces will take care of the rest”.Who will fix the crisis? The people who are already in charge. How? Simply by being open about what they already secretly believe. The rhetorical appeal, here, shares a structure with the appeal that carried the enemy in chief of political correctness to the White House: “That’s just common sense.”Lukianoff and Haidt go out of their way to reassure us: “Neither of us has ever voted for a Republican for Congress or the presidency.” Like Mark Lilla, Pinker and Francis Fukuyama, who have all condemned identity politics in recent books, they are careful to distinguish themselves from the unwashed masses – those who also hate identity politics and supposedly brought us Donald Trump. In fact, the data shows that it was precisely the better-off people in poor places, perhaps not so unlike these famous professors in the struggling academy, who elected Trump but never mind. I believe that these pundits, like the white suburban Dad in the horror film Get Out, would have voted for Barack Obama a third time.Still, they may protest too much. In the midst of what Fukuyama, citing his colleague Larry Diamond, calls a “democratic recession”, the consensus that has ruled liberal institutions for the past two decades is cracking up. The media has made much of the leftward surge lifting Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But as this new left-liberalism gains strength, a growing number of white men who hold power in historically liberal institutions seem to be breaking right.As more and more Americans, especially young Americans, express enthusiasm for democratic socialism, a new right-liberalism answers. Its emerging canon first defined itself in reaction to new social movements highlighting the structural or systemic elements of identity-based oppression. By deriding those movements as “clicktivism” or mere “hashtags”, right-liberal pundits also, implicitly, expressed frustration at how web platforms were breaking up their monopoly on discourse. In January 2015, weeks after a wave of massive Black Lives Matter protests, Jonathan Chait decried Twitter as the launch pad of a “new pc movement”. In the conclusion of The Once and Future Liberal, Lilla also singled out Black Lives Matter for special condemnation, calling it “a textbook example of how not to build solidarity”. Andrew Sullivan has criticised “the excesses of #MeToo”. Just last week, Harper’s and the New York Review of Books published long personal essays in which men accused of serial sexual harassment and assault defended themselves and described their sense of persecution by online “mobs”.Lukianoff and Haidt share some benefactors and allies with the well-established right that funded Bloom and D’Souza. (Lukianoff works at the Foundation for Inidual Rights in Education, a nonprofit group funded by the Scaife and Olin families.) But, reading The Coddling of the American Mind, I was more struck by their points of proximity to the newer Trumpist right. Like Trump, the authors romanticise a past before “identity” but get impatient when actual history itself comes up. “Most of these schools once excluded women and people of colour,” they reflect. “But does that mean that women and people of colour should think of themselves as ‘colonised populations’ today?” You could approach this question by looking at data on racialised inequality in the US, access to universities, or gendered violence. They don’t. Seize the data evidently means not all data. They leave it as a rhetorical question for “common sense” to answer.Their refusal of history severely limits the explanations Lukianoff and Haidt can offer for the real problems they identify. Can you understand the “paranoia” middle-class parents have about college admissions without considering how many of their children are now downwardly mobile? How are college teachers supposed to confidently court controversy when so many of them have zero security in jobs that barely keep them above poverty level?Just as they lack a clear explanation of why the “terrible ideas” that are “harming students” have taken hold, they have no theory of how good ideas cause change. At one point, they note that Pauli Murray, one of their exemplars of “common humanity identity politics”, recently had a college at Yale named after her, as if this proved that in an unregulated market, the right ideas do win in the end. But Yale did not just happen to remember this law school graduate, half a century later Yale named Pauli Murray College following countless student protests around Black Lives Matter – and after a cafeteria worker named Corey Menafee, who got sick of looking at pictures of happy slaves in Yale’s Calhoun College, put his broom through a stained glass window, and his union came to his defence.For all their self-conscious reasonableness, and their promises that CBT can master negative emotion, Lukianoff and Haidt often seem slightly hurt. They argue that intersectionality theory ides people into good and bad. But the scholars they quote do not use this moral language those scholars talk about privilege and power. Bad is how these men feel when someone suggests they have had it relatively easy – and that others have had to lose the game that was made for men like them to win. Their problem with “microaggressions” is this framework emphasises impact over intentions, a perspective that they dismiss as clearly ludicrous. Can’t these women and minorities see we mean well? This is the incredulity of people who have never feared being stereotyped. It can turn to indignation, fast.If there is a new right-liberal dispensation, the two-step from shame to rage about shame may be what brings it closest to the Trumpists. Hints of elective affinities between elite liberalism and the “alt-right” have been evident for a while now. The famous essay that Allum Bokhari and Milo Yiannopoulos wrote in 2016, “An Establishment Conservative’s Guide to the Alt-Right”, cites Haidt approvingly. At one point Lukianoff and Haidt rehearse a narrative about Herbert Marcuse that has been a staple of white nationalist conspiracy theories about “cultural Marxism” for decades. Nassim Taleb, whose book Antifragile Haidt and Lukianoff credit with one of their core beliefs and cite repeatedly as inspiration, is a fixture of the far right “manosphere” that gathers on Redditpol and returnofkings.The commonality raises questions about the proximity of their enthusiasm for CBT to the vogue for “Stoic” self-help in the Red Pill community, founded on the principle that it is men, rather than women, who are oppressed by society. So, too, does it raise questions about the discipline of psychology – how cognitive and data-driven turns in that field formed Haidt and his colleagues Pinker and Jordan Peterson. Lilla admits to envying the effectiveness of the “right-wing media complex”. It is hard to imagine that Haidt does not feel some such stirrings about Peterson, who is, after all, selling more copies of self-help books marketed as civilisational critique. Lukianoff and Haidt quote Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago as an epigraph and key inspiration Peterson, who frequently lectures on the book, wrote the introduction to the 50th-anniversary edition Penguin will publish in November. Predictably, Lukianoff and Haidt cite Martin Luther King as a spokesperson for “good” identity politics – the kind that focuses on common humanity rather than differences. But there was a reason the speech they quote was called “I Have a Dream” and addressed to people marching for jobs. Keeping faith with the ideal that all humans are created equal means working to create conditions under which we might, in fact, thrive equally. In the absence of this commitment to making the dream come true, insisting that everyone must act as if we are already in the promised land can feel a lot like trolling. Why are you making such a big deal about identity, Lukianoff and Haidt ask again and again, of people whose identities, fixed to their bodies by centuries of law and bureaucracy and custom make them vastly more likely to be poor or raped, or killed by the police, or deep in debt. Seize the data! But not all data.In his book, The Reactionary Mind, the political theorist Corey Robin paraphrases Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa: since Edmund Burke, effective reactionaries have been the ones who recognise that in order to stay the same, things will have to change. By contrast, the new right liberals say that things must stay the same in order to progress. America is already great.The core irony of The Coddling of the American Mind is that, by opposing identity politics, its authors try to consolidate an identity that does not have to see itself as such. Enjoying the luxury of living free from discrimination and domination, they therefore insist that the crises moving young people to action are all in their heads. Imagine thinking that racism and sexism were just bad ideas that a good debate could conquer! (As if a person did not need a minimum level of material security to participate in the kind of disinterested debate David Remnick and Steve Bannon might have enjoyed at the New Yorker festival.)As the right liberals insist that students are suffering from pathological “distortions”, a sense of unreality prevails. In their safe space of TED talks and thinktanks and think pieces, the genteel crusaders against “political correctness” create their own speech codes. As their constituency shrinks, their cant of progress starts to sound hysterical. The minds they coddle just may be their own.• The Coddling of the American Mind by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt (Penguin, £20). To order a copy for £17.20 go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

It plans to float a quarter of the stock, nearly 57m shares.The flotation is one of only a few big IPOs ahead of the UK’s departure from the European Union next March, and will test investor appetite to back British companies. The IPO marks a remarkable turnaround for a business that has gone bankrupt seven times in its 105-year history.Andy Palmer, the chief executive, said: “By becoming the only automotive company listed on the London Stock Exchange, Aston Martin Lagonda will provide investors with a fitting opportunity to participate in our future success. Our Second Century Plan gives prospective investors deep insight into how we have executed our turnaround and how we are positioned for growth.”Palmer told Reuters that the level of interest from investors in the IPO had been “unprecedented”.He argued that as a luxury company, Aston Martin was somewhat insulated from Brexit and trade wars, but stressed that nobody wanted tariffs following the UK’s departure from the EU next March. Palmer added that a hard Brexit would lead to a significant weakening in the pound, which would help the carmaker’s exports.Aston Martin is majority-owned by Italy’s Investindustrial and Kuwait’s Adeem Investment and Primewagon, which have agreed not to sell their stakes for 180 days.Aston Martin will publish a full prospectus later on Thursday. It is offering shares to eligible employees, customers and members of the Aston Martin Owners Club resident in the UK.Last week, Aston Martin appointed Penny Hughes, a former Coca-Cola executive, as its chair, along with a string of other boardroom heavyweights ahead of the IPO."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4375b7a01d66ee089d2073baeea5340b9506b999/0_36_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59ba1e3baf35053180fd09fce6f66e83","title":"wetherspoons and mcdonalds staff to strike together","story":"Hospitality industry workers mount unprecedented action to fight ‘poverty wages’Staff at JD Wetherspoon, McDonald’s and TGI Fridays are to strike next month in an unprecedented action by employees in the hospitality sector, where a campaign to recruit new trade union members is gathering pace among workers who have traditionally not been organised.The co-ordination and scale of the action – which takes place on 4 October and includes staff from a number of McDonald’s branches in London and two branches of the pub chain on the south coast – is the first of its kind and engages often young, newly unionised workers who will be striking for £10 an hour and union recognition.Workers from The Bright Helm and The Post \u0026amp  pubs in Brighton told the  securing a wage rise would alleviate their mounting personal debts and lift them out of subsistence living.They have taken a move by Wetherspoon’s to bring forward an annual pay rise for workers from April next year to this November as a sign that the company is sufficiently worried about the possibility of the action spreading. According to the chain, the minimum starting rate for bar staff over 18 is £8.05 an hour while kitchen staff receive £8.25 an hour – increasing by 10p in each case after a probation period.Chris Heppell, a 29-year-old working in one of the pub chain’s kitchens, said that every penny counted when he and his colleagues were struggling to get by. In his own case, more than half of what he earned each month went towards paying £450 in rent to share a cramped one-bedroom apartment.“It’s impossible to save and you find yourself taking on more and more hours just to keep on top of the debt,” said the politics graduate who has worked in the hospitality sector since graduating, spending the last four years on what he described as “poverty wages” at Wetherspoon’s.“Up until recently I haven’t thought very much about the future because it is genuinely scary, but that has started to change.”Heppell is among workers at the pub chain who have joined the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFAWU) after being inspired by the strike action taken last year by McDonald’s workers in a dispute over zero-hours contracts and conditions.Another Wetherspoon’s kitchen worker, 19-year-old student Alex McIntyre, described working for the company as the most “emotionally and physically draining” job he had undertaken after working extensively in the hospitality sector.McIntyre said over the course of a 30-hour week, he worked in a small kitchen that was often understaffed, and put more than half of his wages towards renting in shared accommodation with five others.“I have an overdraft and rarely have a full fridge. I just thought that was what student life was, but there’s a sense now that this could change. Being paid £10 an hour would mean that I literally don’t have to choose between a food shop or getting a long needed haircut – basic things that people take for granted,” he said.“Now though, I’m being asked about union membership by friends and people from my generation on social media who wouldn’t have considered it before. The cards we have been dealt mean that a lot of us have tended to keep our heads down until now.”Wetherspoon’s spokesman Eddie Gershon said that rates of pay have come under review at most pub and restaurant companies and the chain had announced on 14 September that it was increasing pay rates in the last financial year (to July 2018) by £20m and would be increasing rates this year by £27m.“We also decided several months ago that management will work a 40-hour week instead of the current 42.5 hours from April 2019. We are also moving to the same rate for 18-21s as we already have for over 21s from 5 November 2018,” he said.TGI Fridays, which was named and shamed earlier this year by the government for failing to pay workers the legal minimum wage, said at the time of a walk-out in August by staff in a dispute over tips and pay that it believed all of its workers were treated and paid fairly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a65bc9e8820710fc301989db3a35c975abc95eec/52_363_3165_1899/master/3165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb3f25700699fe9cdd8ba87014f1e8ac","title":"everday memories of addis ababa a photo essay","story":"Beginning as a Tumblr page, website VintageAddis invites Ethiopians to share old photographs from family archives, and aims to document the lives of communities throughout the 20th century.

He worked at a garage in the Ethiopian capital by day, and studied engineering by night. At weekends he would roam the countryside in his father’s car, with a tent bought from the German embassy in the boot, and a Konica in his pocket.“I always took the camera with me,” he says, standing in the garden of Addis Ababa’s iconic, though fading, Wabi Shebele hotel, which is still owned by the family of Haile Selassie, Ethiopia’s last emperor. Asmare, now in his 60s, documented his road trips extensively, being one of the few people he knew with a camera – he was the lucky owner of the world’s first commercial autofocus. “There were no photographers at that time,” he recalls. “So I did most of the pictures myself, often with a self timer.”In one carefree shot he leans cockily against his Mazda car in view of Lake Langano, a spot popular with Addis Ababa’s middle classes then and now. His white socks are pulled up high and a red baseball hangs nonchalantly from his fingers. It’s a world away from the land of famine and war that foreign photojournalists etched in the popular consciousness of the 1980s.Terefe’s photos – he believes has more than 1,000 from this period – might have disappeared were it not for Vintage Addis Ababa. A website that started in July 2017 as a Tumblr page, the project Vintage Addis Ababa invites Ethiopians to share old photos from family archives as a part of an effort to document the lives of various people throughout the country’s tumultuous 20th century of empire, war and revolution.Vintage Addis Ababa is the brainchild of Philipp Schütz, a Swiss publisher and photographer based in the city, of Wongel Abebe, an Ethiopian photographer, and of Nafkot Gebeyehu, a documentary photographer. The project peels away the popular cliches to reveal a more innocent city with an intimate and familiar past.Schütz says, referring to some of the 1,800 plus photographs they have amassed so far: “They look exactly like my parents’ family archive, of the photos of my grandparents in the 1950s.” He and Abebe were surprised by the enthusiasm with which the city’s residents accepted the idea. “It was totally unexpected,” he says. “We’re not digging out 100-year-old photos. These are just everyday, family, stories from a time which a lot of people still remember.”Abebe thinks the project taps into a latent frustration with the way the Ethiopia has been represented over the years. “People are sick and tired of the famine and all that,” she says. “This is about how people want to be remembered.” Many of the photos they have received were submitted by friends and relatives wishing to commemorate their departed, or ageing, loved ones.Photographs belonging to the late Kassa Gebru, an engineer-turned-businessman who built Addis Ababa hotel in the 1950s, were given to Abebe by his daughter, who felt he deserved recognition for founding the city’s first venue for live jazz.The project also appeals to the occasional nostalgia some Ethiopians feel for their past, even for a period like the 1980s, a decade stained by bloodshed and economic privation under the communist regime known as the Derg.“I was a bachelor,” says Asmare. “I spent most of my time travelling and I really enjoyed it. In Addis there was less traffic because nobody had cars – the Derg had banned imports – and on Saturday nights there would be parties in Ras hotel, in Ghion hotel, and of course here in Wabi Shebele. When I look at the photos in my albums it’s like a dream.”“Genet’s father was very strict, like most fathers at the time. She wasn’t allowed to go out of the house besides go to school she was expected to come straight home afterwards and would be in trouble if she didn’t arrive within 30 minutes after home-time.” Girls at the time were expected to be timid and walk with their heads tucked down. They weren’t allowed to leave their house for just recreation. “One time, a few girlfriends and I took a photo as we celebrated a friend’s graduation at Addis Ababa university, as she earned her business degree. I had to hide that picture for years so my father wouldn’t see it.”Vintage Addis Ababa is part of a broader trend towards revisiting and rethinking Africa’s recent history. Schütz was inspired by a project that digitises old Ugandan photographs, though his focus was narrower and with more emphasis on family and private lives.Calling to mind the work of the late Malian photographer Malick Sidibé, and Burkina Faso’s Sory Sanlé, both of whom captured the colourful optimism of post-independence west Africa, these photos of mid-century Addis Ababa evoke a similar mood. They chart the evolution of fashion, hairstyles, and even the city’s physical environment, making Vintage Addis Ababa a rich exercise in cultural history. Some of the districts seen here have long since disappeared, or, like the old Italian quarter known as Piassa, are now on the brink of demolition.The project started out as a website aiming to reach as many Ethiopians as possible, but it is soon to be published as a book. The team also hope the idea will eventually spread to other Ethiopian cities.As it stands, Vintage Addis Ababa offers a glimpse into the past but only a fleeting one. “We don’t want to be misleading,” says Abebe, of the project’s title. “You can never represent the whole of Ethiopia in pictures.”“We learned everything, starting from shooting and marching, to office administration and finance,” she remembers. After an intensive training that took well over a year, the women were graduated by the emperor himself. The newly inaugurated women army never went to a battlefield. “We were always invited to shows and asked to make appearances at official events,” Tsehay chuckles, “We were treated more like celebrities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c46b9e042d3309f5b70f08e3a0ed9fd479ba1e80/0_25_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f34887ef13f56d6809876c447b5f6ea4","title":"royal commission botched brexit theresa may red lines","story":"The image of a confident Theresa May arriving in Downing Street on 13\u0026nbspJuly 2016, having swept aside other Conservative hopefuls, now seems to belong to another age. “As we leave the European Union, we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world, and we will make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us,” May promised.Fine words, but the lost opportunity between that speech and her address to her party conference less than three months later is the root cause of so much of the troubles and isions that have beset the Brexit process ever since. There is time for the course of Brexit to be altered. It may be that – this week in Salzburg, perhaps later – the EU will make a genuine attempt to save May’s bacon. It may be that some of the ideas from Chequers will eventually be built into the political declaration forming the basis of the future trade deal, which will be negotiated only after we leave on 29 March 2019. Nonetheless, it is worth exploring what went wrong at the start of May’s premiership to ask how a country that prided itself on having a strong, functioning civil service, a history of pragmatism and huge experience in international relations can have mishandled the approach to Brexit so badly.What is so remarkable is that the government’s first attempt to put the UK’s position on the table in respect of the future deal did not emerge until that Chequers meeting in July 2018. Given that it was always known that there would be only two years in this process once article\u0026nbsp50 was triggered, the question remains: what, beyond an obsession with internal faction-fighting among Tory MPs, was going on during the previous two years?New prime ministers know that the space to set a bold course is never so great as in the immediate aftermath of victory. The window of opportunity was wide open for May that summer. The paramount need was to find a way to unite the nation after the referendum – to create a country that works for every one of us, as she said. Sheltering behind the temporarily useful banality of “Brexit means Brexit”, the government could have moved swiftly to gather all the talents to consider the options. A royal commission would probably have been ruled out as too slow and cumbersome, but some less formal vehicle could have been engineered for the purpose.The time – indeed more time, but for the unnecessary rush to trigger article 50 – could have been used to scout the territory ahead, all the while talking to the EU, making plans to avoid the obvious traps and to seek a path to a successful outcome. Instead, the prime minster allowed her small team of close advisers to dictate the way ahead. The result was heard at the Tory conference that October, in a speech that included red lines on migration (“ending free movement”), sovereignty (“taking back control of our laws”) and ending the jurisdiction of the court of justice. Those red lines, repeated in her Lancaster House speech in January 2017, have hamstrung the UK ever since, while failing to quell the storms within the Conservative ranks.Those speeches made clear to the EU, if not the UK as a whole, that our path was heading straight towards Canada. And “Canada dry” at that: a narrowly focused free trade agreement concentrating on movement of goods. Even where such an arrangement is not in the UK’s interest, as with the loss of access to the Schengen Information System – an intelligence database used 539m times last year by British authorities to look up suspects and vehicles – and the European arrest warrant, so recently used by the UK to put out an alert on the men wanted in connection with the Salisbury attacks.Is there anything to be salvaged as the deadline of 29 March 2019 approaches? First, May must come out of the bunker and talk to real people – business people, employers and their workers – in real places, not simply those staged for the benefit of TV. She must invite in advisers from outside who know how borders actually work, or what applying a visa regime means in practice. Look at the multitude of blogs with policy offerings. At least show some signs of listening to, and engaging with, the other side, rather than driving through a hard Brexit that can only ever suit barely half the country.Second, she should use the window between now and the end of March 2019 to set up that royal commission to work out what the UK wants from that future UKEU free trade deal. The Brexit select committee already provides one template – but its membership should be expanded to include more devolved representation and civil society.And most of all, it’s time to front up with the public over the real trade-offs now in play. The closer we get to Canada, the more sovereignty is returned, but the greater the economic hit. Spell out clearly that what’s sauce for the British goose is sauce, too, for the EU gander. Applying a visa regime to EU nationals means a visa regime will be also applied to British nationals. Failure, even at this late stage, to engage with all sides will create a generation of the disengaged and discontented. That would hardly be the unifying legacy that the prime minister promised two summers ago.• Catherine Barnard is a professor of EU Law at the University of Cambridge and a senior fellow for The UK in a Changing Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5dbb617b08d5f54c4fefc439ad7f71757335599/0_127_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cac0cb457c7bbc00355f185d78772fe3","title":"forgiveness forgotten virtue bitter times","story":"At a literary festival not so long ago, I interviewed the novelist Sophie Hannah – known particularly for her twisty psychological thrillers – and the subject of grudges came up. Hannah’s forthcoming book is a non-fiction study of the power of the grudge to transform our lives, if we work out how to deal with them sensibly and effectively. To be clear, I don’t believe she is advocating tracking down the schoolmate who stole your best marble when you were seven and exacting revenge more along the lines of working out what your grievance is telling you about yourself and how best to deal with it. I nearly forgot to ask another question because I found myself marooned in the memory of a decades-old dispute over a parking space.To this end, she had given each audience member a slip of paper, on which they could fill out their most deeply held grudge and return it to her. Bookish event-goers can be a little wary of audience participation, but her request prompted a flurry of activity: ruminative looks, darkened brows and feverish scribbling.All of which frenzied fulmination is fascinating in the light of the findings of psychologists at Yale, the University of Oxford and University College London, who reported that we’re actually rather better at thinking good of people than writing them off as rotten apples. Molly Crockett, one of the authors of the paper, explains that our brains form “social impressions in a way that can enable forgiveness”, and that this is useful because “people sometimes behave badly by accident” and that “we need to be able to update bad impressions that turn out to be mistaken. Otherwise, we might end relationships prematurely and miss out on the many benefits of social connection.”It’s quite true that the greatest friend is the one who will provide unasked-for reassurance the morning after the night before, as the novelist Beryl Bainbridge once described of her pal Bernice Rubens: “I got drunk at one of her dinner parties and she rang me the next day because she knew I’d be feeling remorse, to tell me I behaved beautifully, which wasn’t true.” The helpful ones who make contact to give you advice about drinking apple cider vinegar and respond to queries about indiscretions with a hesitant “We-ell” are asking to be given the bum’s rush, in my opinion.However, these are trifles compared with the more serious stuff of life as the scientists suggest, it’s one thing to weigh up the positive and negative aspects of a person’s behaviour, but quite another to bend so heavily towards forgiveness and second chances that another’s harmful actions are tolerated, and even normalised, to the detriment of those around them. The report acknowledges, for example, the danger that forgiving can present in the context of bad relationships and, while we know that women in abusive domestic situations frequently stay in them because of an entirely justified fear of violent reprisal should they leave, the emotional consequences of hoping for behavioural improvement that will likely never come can also be highly destructive.Forgiveness is both complex and personal: if we set the bar for casting miscreants into the outer darkness too low, we risk the isolation of perfectionism if we set it too high, we might well find ourselves seething with suppressed resentment. And there is also the issue of projection. None of us is without flaws, nor past incidents in which we know we have behaved less than well if we seek forgiveness for our own frailties, why should we not bestow it? How many times have you raged about the ignominies visited upon you, only to realise you might perhaps be better off looking in the mirror? As the late Josephine Hart, author of the novel Damage, once said to me: “It’s like Medea out there.”On a macro level, traumatised communities that have been through processes of truth and reconciliation generally find it easier to face the future than those that haven’t. But such processes also rely on a basic willingness to admit wrongdoing and culpability as we watch the horrendous unravellings prompted by the #MeToo and other social justice movements, it’s evident that the impunity that abusers have shown and continue to cling to inflicts serious consequential damage.But we can derive something of great potential value from the idea that we are, as human beings, capable of setting the past aside. The propensity of social media to encourage a discourse of denunciation, in which a person’s transgressions co-exist with their present lives, in which the line between “calling out” and futile, zero-sum bullying is ever blurrier, is not, ultimately, a pathway to happiness. There is much to be angry about, and there are many perpetrators of cruelty and malfeasance to confront. But in the week of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, it’s reassuring to see a study confirming the reparative power of admitting our imperfections, saying sorry and moving forward.• Alex Clark writes for the  and the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff69f1516ec6e5b63716c2050c865c0ba3ae0c34/0_131_2731_1638/master/2731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52b98f4e403e9e08ed6e9062286223f5","title":"rational approach immigration labour mac report","story":"After years of Tory hysteria, the Migration Advisory Committee report provides evidenceThe Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) has done a great service with its latest report into the effects of European migration. We have been accustomed to unsubstantiated assertions, wild generalisations and dog-whistle politics about migrants, including from the EU. The Mac provides analysis and evidence.It would be a major departure if this government based immigration policy on evidence or expert advice. Its current policy is designed to create an artificial panic about migration and migrants, despite their positive contribution to our society, our culture and to our economy and public finances.The government’s never-achieved net migration target of below 100,000 is not a workable policy. Any serious efforts to achieve it would hugely disrupt important sectors of our economy and exacerbate the crises in the NHS, social care and other areas.But the target does allow a permanent campaign against migration and migrants in general. Philip Hammond talked of “marauding” migrants threatening standards of living, Theresa May introduced “Go home” vans and the entire Tory party supported the 2014 Immigration Act and the “hostile environment”.The Mac report reveals this campaign is based on falsehoods. The evidence shows that migrants have little or no impact on the employment or wages of UK-born workers. It is not clear, according to the report, that there is even any impact on lower income groups.The report goes on to say that migration is not a major determinant of wages, it may have a positive impact on productivity and there is no evidence that it blocks training it may actually increase it. On public services and public finances the report is unequivocal: European migrants pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits and public services. Through their work in the NHS and elsewhere, it is also clear that they are net contributors to our key pubic services. Finally, the Mac shows there is no increase in crime resulting from this migration.The government is due to produce another immigration bill before the end of the year. Far from “never talking about immigration”, this will be the third such piece of legislation since 2010. The government suggests that it this will be based on evidence. This would indeed be a first. We shall see.Recently, I set out Labour’s new, fairer, simpler immigration policy. It is designed to address our economic needs in a post-Brexit world. The government has numerical targets (which it never even nears). We will have rational criteria. You cannot have both, and numerical targets led this government to blocking much-needed doctors and nurses from coming here, and deporting our own citizens in the Windrush scandal.The criteria are simple. First, we have existing moral and legal obligations to all Commonwealth citizens. We have similar obligations to the 3 million who came here in good faith under freedom of movement, as our citizens did the same in the EU. The final Brexit deal and future trade deals will probably include some measure to allow migration between our country, the EU and those other countries. Our immigration system cannot be an obstacle to striking those deals. Unlike the Tories, Labour will always put the living standards of our population first. I also set out how we will provide work visas for doctors, nurses, social care workers and any other areas where we might still have labour or skills shortages after those Brexit and trade deals have been struck. Each of these categories will be subject to agreed access, based on what is right and what benefits us all.The term “preferential treatment” is not really a helpful one. It conflates movement of people with their rights and obligations once they are here. Instead, Labour will have agreed access to determine who is entitled to be here, and equal treatment of all citizens once they are here.The Mac has come under attack from some business groups for making a distinction between high-skilled and low-skilled workers. Yet we will almost certainly need social care workers and others in future. And when business says it needs workers in other sectors, we will definitely listen. We will also insist on more training, better rights and higher minimum wages for workers already here. This is rational immigration policy, determined by our needs and that works for all of us.• Diane Abbott is Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c45a1575ffcb03dbd75b2a67cf2bc445e014d24c/0_210_5897_3540/master/5897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60a1c85a5fc1bb46b2a809951a0b0473","title":"seven routes peoples vote brexit europe eu","story":"When Theresa May says MPs will have the choice between her Brexit deal and crashing out of the EU with no deal, as she did this week in her Panorama interview, she is being neither honest nor democratic. After all, it is parliament, not the prime minister, who is sovereign – and MPs could well decide to ask the people whether they still want to quit the EU.It’s hard to be sure how the unfolding political crisis over Brexit will play out. But one thing is clear: if MPs want to impose their will on the prime minister, they can, as John Kerr, the former civil servant who helped write article 50, outlines in a new report for the People’s Vote campaign. Although no route to a “people’s vote” is on its own terribly likely, taken together the various scenarios add up to a fairly high chance.If May gets a deal, she has to ask MPs to vote for a motion backing it. They could then amend this motion, saying the deal will only go through if the people support it. For this to happen, Labour would have to back a people’s vote. It is edging in the right direction. About 20 Tory MPs would also need to break ranks. So far there are fewer than 10 – including people such as Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry. But by the time the crunch vote happens, perhaps in the run-up to Christmas, their ranks could swell.Another option is for MPs to reject the motion supporting a deal. The prime minister then has to present alternative plans to parliament. If she proposes that we should crash out with no deal, MPs could force her to hold a referendum. For this scenario to play out, MPs first have to reject a deal. That looks quite likely – since Labour is committed to vote against anything like what May is proposing, and hardline Tory Brexiters such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg are too. But the Mogglodytes probably wouldn’t support a people’s vote. So to get one, a different majority – bringing together the opposition plus pro-European Tory rebels such as Grieve – would probably be needed. That seems quite realistic.Even if MPs vote for the motion backing a deal, they could amend the legislation that would be required to implement it – and demand a new referendum. While it might seem odd for MPs to amend the legislation if they had already backed the motion, some pro-European Tories might prefer to do this as it would look less disloyal to the prime minister. They could also warn, as they voted for the motion, that this was exactly what they were going to do.The prime minister herself could decide to put her deal to the people, either because MPs had rejected it or because she feared they would. This might seem a strange thing to do given how adamant May has been that there won’t be a new referendum. But she used to be equally clear that there wouldn’t be a new election – and she called one last year. So she has form when it comes to U-turns. What’s more, it is not clear what better options the prime minister would have in such a situation. She doesn’t want to crash out of the EU without a deal, despite threatening to do so.What if May can’t get a deal? Parliament has already passed legislation ensuring she can’t just let Britain crash out of the EU. If there’s no deal by 21 January, she has to present alternative proposals. MPs could then amend the motion approving those plans, making them subject to a people’s vote. If there is no deal, this is quite a likely scenario. After all, the number of fanatic Tory MPs who are genuinely happy to crash out of the EU may be only about 30.May could herself ask the people what to do if there’s no deal. After all, she may prefer to get the people to share responsibility for doing anything so crazy.Yet another scenario is a snap general election. That doesn’t seem very likely – even if May can’t get MPs to support a deal. Although Rees-Mogg and his gang might vote against a deal, they are unlikely to join Labour in voting down a Tory government. Still, if they were so hopping mad that they did bring down the government, there would probably be an election. Labour might then say it would negotiate a different deal and put it to the people in a referendum. If Jeremy Corbyn did that, he’d probably win the election as pro-Europeans would flock to his banner.So there are plenty of ways of getting a people’s vote if MPs want one. The snag is that most are still parroting the line that they have to deliver Brexit because that is the “will of the people”. But public opinion is changing – as people see what a pig’s ear the Tories are making of Brexit and realise it is going to be nothing like what Johnson et al promised two years ago.As the Brexit talks reach their finale, it will be increasingly clear that what is on offer isn’t nearly as good as the deal we have got. At that point, MPs must have the courage to ask the people whether they still want to quit the EU.• Hugo Dixon is chair of InFacts and one of the founders of the People’s Vote campaign"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b04195cf94b285bee48f2de3926b124da15f20/0_481_7114_4267/master/7114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2475c79fad8ab4430442292b2f6539c","title":"nasser hussain in the nets how a local cricket club got a first class makeover","story":"When Ilford Cricket Club won a community cricket honour, its facilities were soon transformed – shortly followed by league success and coaching sessions from stars of the game. By Chas Newkey-Burden“Come on, keep those balls coming – otherwise we’re just people standing in a shed!”Nasser Hussain is not here to muck about. The former England captain is putting kids through their paces in the indoor nets of Ilford Cricket School. Famed in his pomp for a feisty batting style, he’s much the same as a teacher. Former England seamer, Sajid Mahmood, is in the adjoining net, teaching bowling.The kids can hardly believe their luck. They lap up the attention of both legends, grab selfies and get their bats signed. Proud parents film on their phones. Balls whizz through the air, and shrieks of excitement bounce off the walls. At the end of the class, a tiny youngster bowls out Hussain. The roof nearly lifts off the hall.Just an hour earlier, poor weather threatened to derail a much-anticipated day. ESPNcricinfo had been booked to give the full match day treatment to Ilford Cricket Club’s tie against rivals Ilford Town, courtesy of NatWest. Hussain and Mahmood were due to give a pre-match masterclass on the pitch.But after weeks of sunny, sweltering conditions, the day began with improbably grey skies, bucketing rain and heavy winds. As everyone sheltered in the clubhouse, the only sign of life outside was a cagouled woman, bravely walking her springer iel through the bluster.Then Hussain arrived, bouncing in with a chirpy: “Turned out nice again.” He was followed by the towering presence of Mahmood. As the energy began to shift, their masterclasses were moved indoors and a weather app suggested that a truncated match could be played in mid-afternoon. It was game on.Speaking after the classes, Hussain explained his pugnacious approach. “Look, cricket can be a dull game if you don’t get on with it,” he says. “I hate coaching sessions when all you hear is the coach – when you have an hour and the coach has spoken for 40 minutes and the kids are standing there bored.”In fact, the kids had been electrified and impressive in both the classes. Mahmood says: “I was really amazed by the number that turned out and the level of talent. Their technique was very, very good.” Hussain agreed, adding: “There’s a strong British-Asian community here and they pick up things very quickly because they follow the game so passionately.”Back at the clubhouse, Ilford chairman Maz Malik’s cheery energy was helping keep the day on track, despite the weather. “We’ve been having sub-continental conditions for six weeks, but today it’s back to the reality of English summer,” he laughed.A cricket fanatic – he says he’d get up to watch the Seychelles play the Bahamas at 3am – he has been part of the club since 1980, when he joined as a nine-year-old. As we speak, the razzmatazz of the day carries on around us: ESPN commentates on the match and NatWest’s virtual reality tent thrills kids. A barbecue sizzles away. Hussain, who cut his teeth here in the 1980s, and Mahmood chat with locals.“It’s been an exceptional day – we were very honoured to get selected,” says Malik. He describes the masterclasses as an “aspirational experience” for local kids. “It brings stars into reality. The kids see that these are human beings and that they can follow in their footsteps.”Gesturing to the NatWest “Cricket has no boundaries” banner, he talks about the “huge” changes he has seen in the sport. “Things have become less stuffy,” he says. “There has been less of the old boys’ network shirts, ties and collars. It’s become more accessible. We’re open for all – people of all abilities and backgrounds.”There are plans to host a “tape-ball” cricket tournament in August to attract those from south Asia and those who find the entry cost to full cricket prohibitive. The club has already subsidised some local youngsters who were referred by local authorities because of difficult circumstances.Members of the club, which was founded in 1879, say the atmosphere and relations across the board are much tighter since the involvement of CricketForce. Everyone has a new spring in their step. The first team recently topped the Essex Premier League for the first time in over 20 years. “I don’t see that as a coincidence,” says Malik.Captain Theeban Tavarasa, 31, has been involved with the club for 18 years, since his talent was spotted one day by Nasser Hussain’s father, Jawad, in the nets of Ilford Cricket School. “We are a very multicultural club, we have people from all walks of life: Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, English, Irish – we’ve got such a good society here,” says Tavarasa.“I believe this local community needs a cricket club like this. When you hear about so much crime and discord in London, a club like ours can help the community with cohesion. We can set a shining example.”Summing up the occasion, Sajid Mahmood strikes a similar note. “Today has brought the community together,” he says. “I think NatWest have done a fantastic job in supporting this. They’ve realised the contribution days like this can make towards community cohesion.”Mohammad Akhtar was the star on the day, with a pivotal 59 from 40 balls as Ilford CC (173 for 4) beat Ilford Town (170 for 8) by six wickets. Watching from the perimeter, Usman Ul Haq, a highly-tipped youngster who also plays for Essex, discusses the positive impact cricket has had on his life. “It helps you stay away from trouble and harmful paths,” says the 13-year-old, whose proud father Inam has been an Ilford member for more than 20 years.“Today has been amazing,” continues Usman with a smile. “How often do you have a first-class cricketer in your net giving you tips, then hanging around, signing your bats and then coming on to the club house to have a nice chat with you?“What I’ve learned more than anything today is that you don’t need to be good at the game to enjoy the game. This whole day has shown that you should play for the love of it. That’s the best way.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

Thirty years ago, he and fellow Toronto artist GB Jones started what later became known as queercore, a fake movement that somehow morphed into a genuine one. “People thought that Toronto was the center of this hardcore movement,” says LaBruce in a new documentary directed by Leyser titled Queercore: How To Punk A Revolution. “But it was just me and two women who sat in their basement and churned out alternative publications and experimental movies.”Yet they were clearly on to something. The primitive DIY projects they produced espoused a philosophy that drew on a long history of political and artistic subversion, one that located a connection between the radical roots of punk and the core insurrection of gay identity. In the process, they aligned two outlaw movements which, even back then, had already started to become domesticated and conforming.“The original punks from the 70s, like Patti Smith and Iggy Pop, were all about breaking with everything that America was moving towards,” said Leyser. “They thought of the middle-class suburban couple with two kids, a job and a dog as a prison they were fighting against. And, in fighting it, they embraced gender-fluid, feminist and queer ideologies.”The very term “punk” has roots in gay sex, referring to a man on the receiving end of anal intercourse in prison. But trying to make those connections in the 80s proved to be a daunting and risky task. While the freewheeling world of early punk embraced a wide range of sounds and sexualities, by the start of queercore it had already ritualized into the macho hardcore trend, whose bands and fans started to look and sound increasingly alike. Similarly, the mainstream gay community was, by then, presenting an exponentially more hetero-normative image. In the film, LaBruce talks about being rejected by two subcultures before he started queercore. “I would get beat up for ‘looking queer’ at hardcore shows,” he said. “And I would get kicked out of gay bars for wearing swastika earrings.”Leyser also fell between two worlds as a punk-loving gay teen growing up in Chicago in the 90s. He found the first inklings of a connection between gay and punk cultures through the work of untamable artists like film-maker John Waters and writers like Jean Genet and William Burroughs (whom Leyser had made an earlier documentary about). “Often when history gets written, these outlaw elements get overlooked,” the director said. “They brush the dirt under the rug rather than celebrate it. In my film, Bruce LaBruce talks about embracing the criminality of gay sexuality, which is what Genet had done.”The early queercore artists not only spread their gospel through zines and films, but also in art and music, all of which were inspired by earlier work from the Dadaists, the Situationists and the Sex Pistols. LaBruce’s clearest role models were seminal John Waters films like Multiple Maniacs and Pink Flamingos. “Waters did the full DIY aesthetic,” Leyser said. “He took all of his crazy friends and put them in front of a camera doing the most extreme things he could think of, like Divine eating dog shit or saying lines like: ‘The life of a heterosexual is a sick and sad existence.’”Waters, who appears in the film, also helped the director get financing for the project. An equally key role model for the movement, within the music world, was gender-transcending glampunk rocker Jayne County. Humor plays a key part in both artists’ work, as it does in later queercore projects. “Bruce LaBruce used humor as a weapon in his films to critique society, just like Burroughs used satire as the sharpest knife to cut through society’s facade,” said Leyser.LaBruce and Jones seeded the movement through their magazine, JD, which, depending on their mood, they would claim stood for JD Salinger, James Dean or Jeffery Dahmer. Their efforts spawned later zines, scenes, labels and bands in Chicago, San Francisco, Edinburgh and London.There was also a porn connection. In the late 80s, Jim Yousling, editor of the LA-based gay skin magazine In Touch, regularly featured rockers like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Henry Rollins in homoerotic photo shoots and interviews well before they became national names.In New York in the late 80s, Dean Johnson and his band, Dean and the Weenies, created Rock’n’Roll Fag Bar, inspiring the later NY club Squeezebox, co-curated by the musician who went on to write the glam-rock musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch. In a seminal crossover moment, Green Day invited queercore band Pansy Division to open on their 1994 breakthrough tour. Around the same time, queercore influenced the riot grrl movement, which has only widened its influence in the years since.Even at its most successful, queercore has never come close to intersecting with the gay or punk mainstream. Today, it’s at even greater odds with the talking points of LGBT politics, which center on what can be seen as a heteronormative agenda – getting married, having children and serving in the military. Many speakers in the film decry this “gay orthodoxy”, underscoring the fact that queercore has as much to do with sensibility as sexuality. “Ultimately, queercore relates much more to the punks than to the gay movement,” Leyser said.Even today’s “gay music” has become more mainstream, with the rise of such fresh-faced “queer pop” artists as Troye Sivan and Kim Petras. Leyser sees another example in Simon Vance Law, who has a hit in Europe with Gayby, which celebrates gay parenthood. “It’s so boring,” the director said. “If it was just him singing to his wife about taking care of their kid, no one would listen. The only value it has is that he’s gay, so straight people can think, ‘Oh that’s so sweet: gay people can be just like us.’”At the same time, more radical queercore artists such as Ssion and Arca are getting increasing media attention. And Leyser cites artistactivist groups such as Germany’s Peng or Russia’s Pussy Riot as keepers of the queercore tradition.It’s notable that the movement, like punk in general, has managed to retain its radical edge 30 years after it started. “Punk has now greatly outlasted hippie culture because it allows people to have a catharsis,” Leyser said. “With hippies, people related to the free love part, but its peace and love message didn’t provide the catharsis that Western society really needs – which is to provide a good place to say: ‘Fuck you.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6519354ce8bb99b1e65d99e5be02ad01213c0ce4/0_390_6472_3883/master/6472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32de26601573fe44418344797338dbf4","title":"send us your questions for mike leigh peterloo interview","story":"The Observer New Review asks you to put your questions to the much-loved director ahead of the release of his new film, PeterlooMike Leigh is one of the country’s most beloved and respected film-makers.

The bloodiest political clash in British history, which led to the formation of the Manchester  two years later, saw government forces clash with peaceful protesters, killing an estimated 18 people and injuring more than 650.

We started quite slowly, we lost too many duels and twice in the first half we gave away the ball in dangerous areas and allowed Lyon to score both times.”Arteta claimed his side’s reaction in the second half was superb, not an adjective that many Mancunians present would have selected, although he was probably correct in saying City created more chances after the interval than before it, even if that was not saying a lot.“At half-time we had to react, but that is normal, whether Pep is in the dressing room or not,” Arteta said. “That happens almost every half-time, it is not a new thing, we just had to try and improve what we were doing.”For a coach with managerial ambitions, this first-hand experience was a considerable disappointment. “I can’t really explain why we began so slowly, but sometimes in a new competition it takes a while to get on track,” he said. “We were finding it hard to come up with the right pass, we couldn’t build up any consistency and Lyon were able to take advantage.The Lyon coach, Bruno Génésio, smiled politely when asked whether beating the early favourites for the Champions League constituted the greatest result in the club’s history. “We have some history and I’m not sure I would call this the greatest feat,” he said. “But it is an achievement and we should be proud of it.“We decided to play as high as possibly to prevent Manchester City building from the back and it seemed to work.

The border with France is a mile away but this is “Little Italy”, where migrants from Piedmont began arriving in the 1880s to make a living at the steelworks below. These days the factory is empty, rusting and a symbol of the days before Luxembourg nimbly recalibrated to create its wealth via the financial services the Italian influence remains vivid, though, and will come to the fore on Thursday in a way nobody could have foreseen.F91\u0026nbspDudelange against Milan presents the kind of European tie the modern-day system is designed to avoid. But the 14-times national champions have, against every expectation, reached the Europa League group stage and the identity of their first opponents has hefty historical resonance.Back in 1916, a club named Alliance Dudelange was created by some of the same workers who had settled on the slope they opted for the red and black colours of their favourite club from back home and that link with the Rossoneri has never quite disappeared. The current club was formed in 1991 through a merger with the two other teams operating in a town of 20,000 inhabitants that Milan should be visiting now sparks senses of destiny and disbelief.“Now and then, you wake up in the morning and think: ‘Is this … is this real?’” says F91’s president, Romain Schumacher, sitting in the offices of the insurance broker for which he is CFO in Luxembourg City, 12 miles to the north. “When we drew Milan I was sitting in a chair and looking like this for 15 minutes” – he mimics open-mouthed shock – “but then you have to get to work.”Schumacher was a player when F91 took their early steps, starting out in the second ision. A photo on the wall of the club’s training ground shows a tall, flaxen-haired footballer wearing their first, bright yellow and red, shirt. Earlier in his career he had played against Barcelona for the now-defunct Aris Bonnevoie in the Cup Winners’ Cup, at a time when it was easier for minnows to take a shot at the best. Nowadays, Schumacher, a charismatic character to whom anecdotes come naturally, runs F91’s operation and is a self-confessed Milan fan who used to visit San Siro up to a dozen times a year. “My sons’ bedrooms were always decked out in their colours,” he says. “But eventually I had no time to go as there was so much to do at this club.”Now he hopes the tools are in place to give his other love a fright. It has been some off-field effort since F91, who had already defeated Legia Warsaw in the third qualifying round, beat CFR Cluj 5-2 on aggregate in the play-offs a month ago. Several of the team are still semi-professional and the club had to swiftly contact eight of their employers to secure full-time release for the frantic months ahead Schumacher has also seconded staff from his own firm to assist an administrative team almost entirely manned by volunteers.Aside from the players and coaches, F91’s two full-timers are a groundsman and a laundry worker. Preparing for Milan’s arrival has required many fresh hands but the work has been done and 8,000 tickets have been sold for the match, which will take place at Luxembourg’s national stadium, Stade Josy Barthel.F91 have never been so popular. “We were not very well loved in Luxembourg until now,” says Schumacher, who proudly points out that they received a letter of congratulations from Grand Duke Henri after defeating Cluj. The lack of affection has obvious roots. Every serial winner, however small, tends to have a backer F91 happen to have a Becca.Flavio Becca, a real estate mogul and serial rattler of cages locally, began sponsoring the club in 1998 on the proviso that they were serious about winning things. They have missed out on the title six times since and although Schumacher says Becca has changed the face of Luxembourgish football there are plenty on a conservative domestic circuit who balk at the foreign players he has brought in and at his sizeable contribution to propping up a club budget that, at €3.3m last season, is nothing by European standards but deals them an advantage at home.Although the country’s football scene is developing at a quicker rate than that of almost any comparable nation in Europe – emphasised when Progrès Niederkorn knocked Rangers out of last season’s Europa League – there is a concern that F91 are growing too big for it and they have in recent years shown interest in joining the Belgian league only to be knocked back by their own federation.“I want Luxembourgish football to profit from our success,” Schumacher says. “It makes no sense to me if the other teams are all 20km behind. We want to help bring the country to its best level. If you look at the infrastructure of the stadiums, it is catastrophic.”F91’s own home ground, Stade Jos Nosbaum, would not pass muster in England’s top five tiers but serves as a reminder that this is, local gripes aside, a club achieving remarkable things. Inside what passes for the office, officials crack open bottles of dark Diekirch beer and reminisce over adventures past and present. Until this season, Red Bull Salzburg, defeated in 2012, were their biggest scalp now mobile phone footage is passed around of the current side bouncing up and down a bus at Cluj airport to the strains of “Sweet Caroline”.The setup is rudimentary but an attack-minded team – coached by the 37-year-old Dino Toppmöller, son of the ex-Bayer Leverkusen manager Klaus – has tools complex enough to trouble Milan and their other two group stage foes, Real Betis and Olympiakos.“At the moment it’s incredible,” Schumacher says. “Everything is Dudelange, Dudelange, Dudelange.” The thousand or so newcomers who built houses on that incline more than a century ago could scarcely have imagined their reminder of the country they left would bring something like this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2820ddf09e7e2dc4ed0e2bf0a9b4c38c8a40e05/123_13_1799_1079/master/1799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fdf3af3141a22fa9db85af688b8f395","title":"paul pogba thanks jose mourinho manchester united penalty young boys","story":"Paul Pogba has thanked José Mourinho for trusting him to take a penalty against Young Boys, with Manchester United’s manager returning the sentiment in a further sign that relations between them are easing.Pogba’s comments came after he scored twice in the 3-0 opening Group H victory at the Stade de Suisse on Wednesday, his second goal coming from the spot.“I didn’t have any doubts about taking the penalty,” he told MUTV. “I know I missed that one against Burnley – Joe Hart got me that time – but I won’t do the same mistake. I had the confidence of the players, they let me take it and I should thank them for this, as well as the manager – he let me take.”Mourinho in turn praised Pogba. “I like the player to have the courage to take a penalty after one that he missed,” he told MUTV. “He missed against Burnley. The next penalty the team has, he is there to take it, to make it 2-0 and to kill the game for us.”At the start of the season there was speculation Pogba wanted to leave United. Yet after the defeat of Leicester City in the opening match, Mourinho said he had never been happier with the Frenchman and their latest public words indicate a further upturn in the relationship.Pogba is intent on continuing the form that has given him four goals in six United games, having managed six last season for the club and nine in the previous campaign. His opener at Young Boys featured him making a run from midfield to near the area before a left-foot finish.The victory was United’s third in a row, all away from home, following successive defeats, by Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion.“When you win you are happy but we are still trying to get better,” Pogba said. “We are changing the team and the players that come in feel like they are already in the team and that’s what we need.”United’s next three group games are against the other sides in the group, starting with Valencia at home, followed by two meetings with Juventus.Pogba said: “We needed to start well. We did it and got the result we wanted. Maybe the performance should have been better but we have the result and the three points so we are very happy. I’m happy as well to score the goals that were decisive in the win.”United did not have any issues with the plastic surface. “When we trained the day before it was a bit strange because we are used to playing on grass but we had to win and the result was the most important thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57cfc9b45b6cf3336fde23b4c3430282d8306c5d/0_134_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=356d65e4399b0cfb7d2770c55b9102b5","title":"john lewis customer service carpet","story":"The stairs in our new house were slippery so we ordered a carpet runner from John Lewis.

One Labour official said the number of motions on Brexit was so vast that they could have difficulty devising other motions for debate on other topics.Last year in Brighton, delegates followed Momentum’s direction to save the leadership’s blushes and blocked any potential vote on Brexit. In Liverpool, delegates will arrive with an unprecedented mandate from members to put a second referendum on the table after a campaign led by the pro-Corbyn grassroots.“The numbers are completely crazy. I thought we’d get 50,” one pro-remain MP said.Many campaigners and MPs hope the efforts will resonate beyond the party conference in ways that could have a major and unforeseen effect on the parliamentary arithmetic.“It gives MPs some cover,” another MP said. “Some have resisted voting on anti-Brexit amendments because they will get grief locally for seeming to be disloyal. But if their CLP has put this motion forward, it gives them the freedom to vote with their conscience.”Chessum, a member of Momentum’s first steering committee, said he wanted to transform the pro-remain cause within the party into one that was explicitly leftwing, tribally Labour and pro-Corbyn.“I am a diehard remainer and a diehard member of the hard left,” he said. “There is no bespoke Labour Brexit on the table. There is no time, even with a general election.”Chessum argues he is giving the leadership space to change its position, rather than closing it into a corner. “The Labour right loves ‘Corbyn v the membership’. That’s not what this is.”The group is technically cross-party and has worked with other leftwingers and Greens. For the summer, it has been working in co-ordination and hosting phone banks for another explicitly Labour group run by Mike Buckley, a former aid worker and community organiser, who founded Labour for a People’s Vote this year.“There was nothing to rally behind,” he said. “The people talking publicly about having another referendum, however well intentioned they are, they are not going to gather the majority of Labour party members behind them because they are seen as being anti-Jeremy.”Both groups have regional organisers and have relied on sign-ups and their existing networks, in local parties and Momentum groups, some relics of the 2016 referendum campaign.For all the groups involved, there is no roadmap. The summer’s efforts have involved a painstaking task of identifying pro-European members in more than 600 local parties, through a mix of local contacts, friends of friends, and online signups, and getting them to champion a motion through their CLP.Buckley said that organising local parties has been “surprisingly difficult” and relied on local knowledge. Both groups have links with the main cross-party campaign People’s Vote, but maintain a public separation. Another mainstream group, Best for Britain, the anti-Brexit campaign that has the financial backing of billionaire philanthropist George Soros, has given £70,000 to Another Europe is Possible.Pro-European MPs have aided the groups in the background, helping them make connections, but have deliberately not led the campaigning.Though the groups are mainly run by young activists, it is older Labour members who have been the focus of some of the summer campaigning, because they make up the bulk of new members active in CLPs.The group that has most successfully used this tactic is the energetic pro-remain youth group For Future’s Sake (FFS) – a cross-party campaign which has close links to the official People’s Vote movement.Its young organisers have made provocative videos, deliberately designed to appeal to older members, placing the arguments about Brexit in the context of progressive political movements in British history, including the campaign for women’s suffrage and fighting the poll tax.FFS’s Liron Velleman has been co-ordinating its campaign on the ground to get CLPs to submit motions. “We get young people to sign up and then encourage older people from the CLP to get involved in the fight,” he said. “We tell them, our generation needs yours.”Previously unreleased data showed the average age of Labour party members and supporters who joined after 2015 is 51, and the most common age of this cohort to be 66. The project’s summer 2017 survey of Labour members revealed an average age of 53, with the most common age being 70.Now the local party organisation is over, campaigners from the main groups are turning their attention to the party conference itself. The first hurdle is ensuring Brexit is a topic on the agenda at conference, as one of eight topics chosen by members.Last year, Momentum steered its delegates to vote for other topics, including housing, NHS and the railways. That will not be repeated, its national co-ordinator, Laura Parker, said. “Last year, the context was very different. Now, it’s absolutely inevitable there will be a discussion on conference floor, I can’t conceive there won’t be – we’re 200 days away,” she said. “Without a doubt, there has to be a debate.”Momentum has not backed a new referendum and there is clearly some caution about doing so. Parker’s instincts are pro-Europe, but she is wary of restricting the Labour leadership’s political flexibility.“We are waiting to see what motions come to conference floor,” she said.Once Brexit is confirmed as a topic for debate in the ballot, delegates from those CLPs will meet trade union representatives and Labour’s Brexit secretary Keir Starmer on Sunday night to thrash out a compromise motion that could go to a vote.Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, an FFS co-founder, said the groups would be co-ordinating. “The one cast-iron agreement across all the groups is that a people’s vote is the way to solve the crisis,” she said.Some senior Labour sources cautioned that it was now uncertain if delegates would be responsive to either Momentum or any of the other campaign groups.“Delegates are totally unbiddable now,” one said. “Last year, there was some degree of predictability that most delegates would at least do what Momentum instructed, but that is no longer the case.”Key to the success of any motion or compromise is the support of trade unions. Campaigners have been closely watching both the Unite conference and the subsequent Trades Unions Congress, where union leaders accepted or put forward motions that could be a blueprint for the Labour outcome.One of the “big three” unions, GMB, has already officially backed a new referendum, after polling its members. Smaller unions have also been key players, most notably TSSA and its general secretary, Manuel Cortes, and Community, a centrist union with many Brexit-voting members whose industrial membership recently backed a vote on the deal.Unite, Labour’s most generous donor and the UK’s second largest union, left the door open to backing a second referendum at its conference, with a leadership statement saying it was “open to the possibility of a popular vote being held on any deal, depending on political circumstances”.That statement is now the most likely model for a Labour compromise. “The key voice in the room will be Unite,” one senior union source said.The third major union, Unison, the largest in the UK, has remained studiously neutral. “They will be in the room at conference, they might act as honest brokers, but they don’t want to be forced to take a position,” the source said.The final outcome may ultimately be a fudge, the party’s governing national executive committee could offer a policy statement, keeping a referendum on the table without endorsing it. Starmer and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have trialled that line in recent months.However, even if the NEC offers a statement, delegates could still push for an additional vote and a more radical motion.In the end, there is little will at the top of the party to prevent a Brexit debate taking place. “We would look ridiculous,” one source close to the shadow cabinet said. “The headlines last year were bad, but this would look terrible to outsiders watching.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d08374778fef4602cfb829e1df3b5e6ff2af62/0_150_2833_1700/master/2833.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f450b67b7961cf6200150b40845e350","title":"macron urges eu leaders to stand firm against theresa may brexit","story":"French president says EU should resist prime minister’s calls for compromise on BrexitEmmanuel Macron has appealed to his fellow European leaders to maintain a principled approach to Brexit in response to Theresa May’s demand for compromise and accusations that the French president wants to make Britain suffer.Macron, who is fighting a rearguard action against the rise of populism in Europe, said blocking any attempt by the UK to pick and choose elements of EU membership had to be the priority in the dying days of the Brexit negotiations.“May spoke last night,” Macron said of the UK prime minister’s presentation to the leaders in Salzburg. “My first wish is to stay united and to have a common approach, the 27. It is essential. The second thing is that we remain coherent. The solution must be found. The third thing is that we need to have a real retirement agreement by November.”A number of fellow EU leaders have conceded that compromise from both sides is needed to reach a deal both on avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and on the future framework of a trade deal.The nationalist prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orbán, who has sparred with Macron over migration, told reporters he was getting close to building a majority of member states in opposition to “a camp of prime ministers” who believe the “British must suffer”. “I don’t like that approach at all”, he said.Over coffee at the end of a dinner that finished after midnight, May insisted the UK had moved its position and it was the turn of Brussels to reciprocate.There is a consensus among the 27 member states that the central planks of May’s Chequers plan on trade are not workable, but with the encouragement of Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, some have suggested the EU should seek to bridge the gap with fresh proposals.Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian prime minister, said: “You know that, as before, the approaches are very different. But to report something positive, inside the room, away from the hard media statements outside, I think both sides are aware that they will only reach a solution if they move towards each other.”Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, told reporters as he arrived at a summit that he believed “compromise from both sides, not from one side” was necessary. But when asked why the EU had not budged, he added: “We have some colleagues around the table who think the same about Theresa May.”The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, whose country is an advocate for offering May a counter-proposal in the coming weeks, said that avoiding cherry-picking by the British while keeping them close and avoiding a no-deal scenario was a difficult balancing act.The EU is aware of the domestic dangers facing May as she approaches the Conservative party conference and beyond. The usually outspoken European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said of May’s brief speech: “It was interesting, it was polite, it was not aggressive. She is doing her job.”Earlier, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said he would like to see Britain hold a second referendum on membership of the EU.May specifically ruled out a second vote in her comments at dinner. But Babis told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We hope that finally we will reach a deal but I am very unhappy that the UK is leaving, so it would be better maybe to make another referendum and maybe the people in the meantime could change their view.“Europe has a lot of problems. We have problems with Mr Trump about tariffs, sanctions with Russia, Brexit, migration and so on. For Europe, it’s quite a difficult time. We were shocked when the referendum was announced that there were so many people practically unhappy. Even the chief of commission didn’t understand.”Babiš said a second referendum would “solve the problem quite quickly”, but he also said there would “hopefully” be a deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bdcdeb7a36c280cac4a411f4fd24794cdcee59e/0_16_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f622485c23d082e73477852a865ec9","title":"danny cipriani left out england rugby squad","story":"Danny Cipriani has been left out of the first England training squad since his two convictions for common assault and resisting arrest. Cipriani has since made a flying start to the season with Gloucester but he is the eye-catching omission from Eddie Jones’s 36-man squad which includes Manu Tuilagi and the suspended Chris Ashton.Cipriani is England’s incumbent fly-half, having made a first start in a decade against South Africa in June, but in August he was arrested following a nightclub incident during Gloucester’s pre-season tour of Jersey. He was fined a total of £4,000 and found guilty by the Rugby Football Union of “conduct prejudicial to the interest of the game”.This month Jones revealed he had since visited Cipriani and that he would “make a decision on whether he’s going to add value to the team”. He also added that: “If a guy gets in trouble all the time you’ve got to have second thoughts about it. We will make a decision on whether he’s going to add value to the team.”Jones does not name his squad for England’s autumn internationals until 18 October – this is a three-day training camp in Bristol where the players will, among other things get accustomed to their new defence coach, John Mitchell – but while Cipriani’s hopes of retaining his place are not over, his omission would suggest his chances are damaged.Tuilagi meanwhile, is rewarded for showing some semblance of early-season form – he has started all three of Leicester’s matches and scored a fine try against Newcastle – and is included by Jones for the first time since he was sent home in disgrace after a late-night drinking session last August. He has not played for England since a replacement appearance against Wales during the 2016 Six Nations and not started since the summer of 2014 but Jones’s decision to cast his eye over him makes obvious sense with exactly 12 months to go until the World Cup.“It’s the first time in the three years I’ve been in England that Manu’s been fit,” said Jones. “He’s put together a series of games and we’re looking forward to him continuing on that run. He’s got the opportunity to come in and show us what he’s got.”Ashton’s selection is not surprising in that Jones had hinted at including him a couple of weeks ago but he is currently in the middle of a seven-week selection for a tip tackle during pre-season and will not have played a competitive match at all this season before Jones names his autumn squad. He was included in Jones’s August training squad however, in what constituted an immediate recall following his summer move from Toulon to Sale.Among the other notable inclusions is Michael Rhodes, Saracens’ uncapped South Africa-born flanker who may make his debut against the Springboks in England’s opening autumn fixture on 3 November. Billy Vunipola is in the squad, as is Zach Mercer and Joe Cokanasiga but their Bath teammate Sam Underhill is a surprise omission. As are the Exeter pair of Luke Cowan-Dickie and Sam Simmonds – though the former suffered a rib injury at the weekend and the latter missed out through illness.The Wasps pair of Joe Launchbury and Brad Shields are both included despite carrying injuries while Danny Care, George Kruis and Jack Nowell all return the squad. Dan Cole is still not in the squad though, nor is James Haskell following his summer move to Northampton.Jones added: “It’s a chance to get the players thinking about England and the way we want to play for England and the way we want to beat South Africa. These players have the opportunity to press their chances for selection ahead of the first Test so they will have to be enthusiastic and ready to give their best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdec9203ad7ed817ccd0916405163834d6888f36/0_210_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1524b941a478057b6c0930ef5620568f","title":"labour pledges ban on tv gambling adverts during live sports","story":"Tom Watson announces a number of policies designed to tackle addiction ‘epidemic’ Gambling companies will be banned from advertising on television during live sports if Labour wins the next general election, as part of a crackdown designed to tackle an addiction “epidemic”.Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, accused the government of letting the UK’s estimated 430,000 problem gamblers down, as he announced a number of policies that would tighten up betting regulations.The list of proposals, unveiled days before the party’s annual conference in Liverpool, include:Watson said: “Problem gambling is Britain’s hidden epidemic and we must treat it as a public health emergency.”He said existing regulations, introduced under the previous Labour government in 2007, were “not up to the job of protecting addicts”.“Gambling companies have to take more responsibility for harm caused by their products and contribute more to research and treatment,” he said.“We must also face up to the negative effect the explosion in gambling advertising has had and act accordingly.“The refusal of the current government to address any of these issues is letting problem gamblers and their families down.”Labour said gambling ads would be prohibited from “whistle to whistle” of sports events, citing claims from academics that gamblers are more impulsive and reckless when betting on live games.As it stands, betting companies voluntarily restrict their advertising to live sports only.Research by the  earlier this year found that this agreement still allowed for up to 90 minutes of gambling ads during the World Cup in Russia, prompting concerns about the impact on children.Several senior figures in the gambling world support restricting their own ability to advertise, amid concerns about their public image in the wake of the debate over fixed-odds betting terminals.William Hill’s chief executive, Philip Bowcock, said the industry should “collaborate with government to reach a long-term solution that also addresses public concerns”.But a government gambling review concluded earlier this year that there was not enough evidence to support new curbs on advertising.Broadcasters have also lobbied hard against a measure that would crimp revenue from gambling ads, worth up to £200m a year, according to a senior industry source.Chris Skidmore, Conservative vice-chairman for policy, said: “Labour liberalised the gambling market when they were in power and have admitted that they were wrong.“We are correcting Labour’s mistakes – ensuring tighter rules on gambling advertising, increasing protections around online gambling, launching a multimillion pound awareness campaign, commissioning research on the harms of problem gambling and slashing the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals, which were introduced under Labour.“This Conservative government is working to build a fairer society and ensure the most vulnerable are protected.”A spokesperson for the Advertising Association said Labour’s proposal would “have a damaging economic effect on our UK commercial media landscape, as well as make watching live sport more expensive and less accessible for the UK public”.Labour also backed calls from the GambleAware charity to make firms pay a mandatory levy to fund research and treatment.Other measures include asking banks to help customers block gambling transactions on their debit cards, a service already offered by Monzo and Barclaycard.Labour would also ban the use of credit cards to place bets online."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a02336220a4423de8a190875a636fab3c81a38aa/0_27_900_540/master/900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9702910541295fa1ee845b3ec0a02311","title":"tartuffe rsc buoyant satire of modern religious hypocrisy","story":"The Swan, Stratford-on-AvonThis striking new take on Molière by the writers behind Citizen Khan sends up religious phoniness and secular pretensionThese days, every classic play seems to be updated or “reimagined”. In the case of this new version of Molière’s Tartuffe by Anil Gupta and Richard Pinto, who collaborated on TV’s Citizen Khan and The Kumars at No 42, it makes total sense. What we see is a satire on modern religious hypocrisy that respects Molière’s flawless comic structure.The action has been relocated to a Birmingham suburb where a British Pakistani family live a life of comfortable affluence. Imran, the parvenu patriarch, was once proud of his Norwegian spruce decking, but has fallen under the spell of a seemingly straitlaced holy man, Tartuffe. Not only does Imran decide the family has to live as “real Muslims”, he also plans to marry his progressive daughter, studying the plight of women in sub-Saharan Africa, to Tartuffe and even signs over his property to the two-faced intruder.This is not the first time the play has been given an Asian context. In 1990, Jatinder Verma did a production set in Mogul India with Tartuffe as a saffron-skirted fakir for the National Theatre. The virtue of this new version by Gupta and Pinto is that it attacks both religious exploitation and secularised sophistication without condescension. In fact, it goes out of its way to make clear that Tartuffe is an aberrant con man rather than a genuine product of Islam. In one of the most potent lines of the production, Imran’s closest friend asks Tartuffe “how the most tolerant and academically inquisitive religion in the world ended up being hijacked by people like you?”Gupta and Pinto’s shrewdest stroke is to elevate the cleaner, Darina, into a pivotal figure. Hilariously played by a busily hoovering Michelle Bonnard, she here is a Bosnian Muslim who sees through Tartuffe’s fakery and the family’s social pretensions. She caps Tartuffe’s quotations from the Qur’an about female modesty by arguing that there is nothing to prove women should cover their hair or head. At the same time, she sees through the absurdity of Imran’s bromance with Tartuffe by comparing them to George Clooney and Brad Pitt – if the last two were Pakistani Muslims.Molière’s ironically happy ending has been ingeniously rewritten and even evokes a sliver of sympathy for Tartuffe. But Iqbal Khan’s buoyant production, like the text, gives full value to the set pieces, including the famous scene of Tartuffe’s attempted seduction of Imran’s wife. Asif Khan endows Tartuffe with just the right blend of outward sobriety and furtive lechery as he hops around in his leopard skin underpants. Simon Nagra as Imran exudes the guilt-ridden gullibility of a Birmingham businessman anxious to return to his Muslim roots, while Sasha Behar as his wife suggests a strong woman perfectly capable of outwitting Tartuffe on her own terms.One or two minor characters are strenuously overplayed and, though Sarah Sayeed’s music is good, it works overtime to remind us of the eclectic tastes of Imran’s family.The joy of the show is that it offers a vigorous new take on Molière’s play by reminding us that wealth offers no protection against a hostile environment and that all of the world’s religions are subject to slippery abuse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aeb7ebd336600913d86e840f0fd486b243cd316/0_526_4750_2850/master/4750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4111646750bafa68d38d0d6fc597bdd4","title":"north yorkshire lyke wake walk york moors","story":"Why would anyone want to hike 40 miles in less than a day? Because this ‘death march’ is the Yorkshire equivalent of climbing EverestAfter 28 hard miles, after cuckoos and curlews and dust and pain and sweat, Gerry Orchard crosses Wheeldale Beck over the stepping stones and sinks to one knee. This is no exhausted collapse it is the prelude to a song.“This yah neet, this yah neet,” he sings in a strong Yorkshire voice, “Ivvery neet an’ all. Fire an’ fleet an’ cannle leet, an’ Christ tak up thy saul …”The Lyke Wake Dirge, which dates back to the 16th century or earlier, was sung over the dead as part of local funeral custom. Since 1955 it has had a curious (after)life of its own, giving a name and a certain gravity to the Lyke Wake Walk, a challenge requiring walkers to cover 40 miles over the North York Moors, between the villages of Osmotherley and Ravenscar, within 24 hours. Singing is optional, though traditionalists with breath to spare may find the dirge soothing, a balm to sore feet and calloused souls.This, if I manage it, will be my first Lyke Wake Walk it will be Gerry Orchard’s 220th. He has made more successful crossings than anyone. When Bill Cowley, the North Yorkshire farmer who invented the Lyke Wake Walk, insisted that a “solemn silence should always prevail” upon it, he did not reckon with this man – 62 and whippet-thin – who is as fond of talking as he is of walking, and keen, whenever possible, to combine the two.“There’s a lot of stories that coffins were carried across the moors in days of old,” he says, “but sadly they’re not true. The real connection with the dirge is that toward the end of the Lyke Wake you feel like death. You look at those tumuli, the ancient burial mounds on the moors, and you think, ‘The guy in there is lucky. He has found peace, whereas I am still suffering.’”He chuckles. “One day, hopefully, when my time has come, they will bury me under there, and my ghost can heckle walkers as they go by.”We set off from Osmotherley at a little after 5am, choosing to walk west to east, towards the sea. High spirits, low cloud. It is cold and a little damp.“That’ll keep the snakes off,” says Gerry: adders are common on the moors. Six geese pass close enough for us to hear the shush of their wings. Bracken pushes, crosier-like, through the hillside. For its first nine miles, the walk passes through a landscape that is semi-agricultural and not unlike parts of the Highlands. One of the challenges and risks of the Lyke Wake is that it is not well waymarked but, here and there, on signposts for the Cleveland Way, some guerrilla hiker has screwed small wooden coffin shapes, painted black.In preparing for the walk, I had spoken with two men who were among the group of 13 who pioneered the first successful crossing, which took place on 1-2 October 1955. Bill Dell, now 78, was a boy scout from Middlesbrough. Malcolm Walker, 81, was a member of York Mountaineering Club (YMC). Both learned about the walk from the Dalesman magazine, where Bill Cowley issued a challenge to anyone who believed they could cover the distance in one day. It was much harder back then, Dell recalled: “There weren’t many paths. You were pushing through heather. We had a break at midnight in a couple of tents up on Blakey Ridge.”With the hotheadedness of youth, Walker and two others from the YMC decided to set off from this camp before the rest of the party were awake and crossed the finish line, as he recalled with some regret, three hours before everyone else.“I was in an awful state when I finished but the exhilaration was tremendous. It stretches the body of the average person to its absolute limit. For those of us who couldn’t aspire to climbing Everest, it was the greatest physical challenge we could hope to do.”The Lyke Wake is an odd mix of the attritional and the intense. You grind out the distance, always mindful you are walking against the clock.“It’s a war, not a battle,” says Orchard.It’s also psychological. If the idea of walking 40 miles is overwhelming, try to think of it as several shorter walks. Our plan is to stop, briefly, every time the route crosses a road. Gerry’s partner Julie meets us to replenish water bottles and hand out snacks from the boot of her car.This saves us carrying too much weight but even a supported walk can be tough. Three-quarters of the way across, I develop large blisters on the sides of each foot and will have to endure the last 10 miles in pain. The famous question posed in Corinthians, “O death, where is thy sting?”, finds a ready answer on the Lyke Wake Walk.But blisters are nothing. Gerry has seen walkers forced to give up with broken toes, broken wrists and, most commonly, utter exhaustion.“It can get highly emotional,” he says. “Grown men have been in tears.” The Lyke Wake can be bleak, the hours slow time snags and drags in the heather. There is a strong sense of the centuries collapsing into one another. A bronze age barrow, a medieval cross, the sinister pyramid of the RAF Fylingdales early-warning system … All are monuments raised by man, centuries apart – pagan, Christian, secular – yet each with the same twin purpose: hearkening to the universe while leaving some mark upon the Earth.Gerry will leave his mark, too – if only in the record books. Of the four “centenarians” – those who have completed 100 or more crossings – only two are still alive: Louis Kulcsar, now 80, who arrived in Britain from Hungary in 1956 as a refugee, is the other. Kulcsar, a retired baker, has completed the Lyke Wake 186 times, and has the distinction of having walked it without shoes and socks, an unimaginable feat on unimaginable feet he has also run it backwards. Gerry has walked the Lyke Wake so many times he could have walked from here to Papua New Guinea instead.At 8.36pm, in drifting fog, on limping legs, we reach the end: a stone marker just outside Ravenscar. “Stop the clock,” says Gerry, “we’re here.” It has taken 15 hours and 36 minutes. He hands me a patch in the shape of a coffin, and an official New Lyke Wake Club card. “Condolences,” it says, “on your crossing.” Now, if I wish, I can call myself a Dirger.Personal triumph, however, does not feel like an appropriate emotion at the end of the Lyke Wake. This isn’t a landscape to conquer. It is a memento mori on which one may, briefly, feel never more alive.

In the essay, he described himself as a victim of “mass shaming” and said he had endured “enough humiliation for a lifetime”.He wrote: “Even as I feel deep remorse about how I treated some people in my life, I cannot confess to the accusations that are inaccurate. What I do confess is that I was emotionally thoughtless.”The publication of the essay, which was hotly debated within the NYRB’s small team of editors, provoked a storm of debate about the extent to which men who had been the subject of #MeToo accusations of inappropriate or abusive sexual conduct should be allowed to rehabilitate themselves into society. It also raised eyebrows about Buruma’s editorial judgment.Buruma added fuel to the fire when last week he gave an interview to Isaac Chotiner of Slate in which he clumsily sought to justify the decision to publish. Though he praised the #MeToo movement, that has put the spotlight on the sexual misconduct of powerful men, as “a necessary corrective on male behavior”, he said: “Like all well-intentioned and good things, there can be undesirable consequences.”He went on to lament a “general climate of denunciation” and said that in the case of Ghomeshi there had been “undesirable, or at least unresolved, aspects to it”.Asked to comment on the numerous allegations of sexual assault by Ghomeshi – including punching women on the head – Buruma replied: “The exact nature of his behavior – how much consent was involved – I have no idea, nor is it really my concern.”Buruma, 66, has written often for the . He is author of several books including Murder in Amsterdam: the Death of Theo van Gogh and the Limits of Tolerance and is professor of democracy and human rights at Bard College in New York state.A statement from the NYRB, which is published by Rea Hederman, who bought it in 1984, was expected later on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7612e636dd90e7059ebfb76b4d45766b7b96ff5e/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb15334049b788d62cf123633f1da6db","title":"boorish tourists in venice targeted in mooted sitting down ban","story":"Residents’ groups are kicking back against the latest in a long list of banned activitiesAuthorities in Venice have proposed banning people from sitting and lying on the ground as the city pursues its quest to clamp down on what some officials describe as “boorish” tourists.The potential rule was suggested by the mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, and would mean transgressors being fined between €50 and €500 if implemented.Sitting down on the steps of monuments or those of the portico that surround St Mark’s square is already banned.The proposal is expected to reach a vote in the city’s council in October, although it faces opposition from councillors from the Five Star Movement as well as residents’ activist groups.“There is such a long list of things that are forbidden in Venice there is nothing left that you can do,” said Marco Gasparinetti, who leads the residents’ group Gruppo Aprile 25. “They would need to hire an extra 5,000 officers to properly enforce everything.”Authorities are also considering banning music on boats, the principal mode of transport for residents. People can already be barred from the city or fined for drunken behaviour and swimming or dipping their toes in the canals. Snacking on steps or while walking along the street are also frowned upon.Each summer, a group of so-called “angels of decorum” patrol the main tourist areas to ensure people are respecting the rules. Designated picnic areas, away from the hotspots, have been assigned for the purpose of sitting down and eating, although few people are aware of this.Venice has long struggled to manage a tourism industry that brings in about 60,000 visitors a day, many arriving by cruise ship. Paola Mar, the city’s tourism chief, told the Observer in July that the decorum rules were not about criminalising particular groups but “respecting” the city."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a23edd7b152d7f3b58ae062ce11cd60cf76dc392/7_0_2576_1546/master/2576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=426770d908604d18c844e473fefeb88d","title":"parallel lives matching portraits from south and north korea in pictures","story":"As South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, visits Pyongyang for the third summit with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, take a look at the photographer Ed Jones’s comparative portraits from the two countriesJones said of his photos: “You can put the pictures side by side but the people can’t stand side by side in real life and there’s something inherently captivating about that.”Lee Chi-yoon, an instructor at the Mokdong shooting range in Seoul, on 25 May 2017, and Kim Su-ryon, a staff member at the Maeri shooting range in Pyongyang, on 21 February 2017.Kim Kun-ho, 25, on his watersports boat on the Han River in Seoul on 19 August 2017, and Kim Il-soo on his tourist boat on the Taedong River in Pyongyang on 25 November 2016.Cpl Woo on the south side of the truce village of Panmunjom, within the Demilitarised Zone, on 2 August 2017, and Lt Kim on the north side of the village on 2 June 2017.Jenni Lim, 21, a student, at a computer lab at Yonsei University, Seoul, on 10 October 2017, and Ri Young-hwa, 19, a volunteer staff member and student, at a computer lab at the Scitech building in Pyongyang on 26 November 2016.Kwon Ye-seul, 30, at the Caribbean Bay waterpark south of Seoul on 6 August 2018, and Ri Song-hui, 21, at the Munsu water park in Pyongyang on 22 September 2017.Yoon Hyerim, 10, after a dance performance at Dongdaemun Design Plaza during Seoul fashion week, on 20 October 2017, and Kim Song-jong, nine, after a dance performance at a Children’s Day event in Pyongyang.Kim Young-hoon, a lifeguard at the One Mount water park in Ilsan, on 30 September 2017, and Choe Un-hwa, a staff member at the Munsu water park in Pyongyang, on 22 September 2017.Lim Jun-beom, 24, a student, in the Sinchon area of Seoul on 5 May 2018, and Pak Kum-ryong, 23, also a student, in a public square in Pyongyang on 22 September 2017Hong Sung-cho, 35, with his son Hong Jinu, two, at a supermarket in Bundang, near Seoul, on 1 September 2018, and Han Gwang-rim, 34, with his daughter Su Ryon at a supermarket in Pyongyang on 4 June 2017.An unidentified pump attendant at a petrol station near Goyang on 15 September 2017, and Kim Su-hyang, 18, at the petrol station where she works on the road between Pyongyang and Nampho on 24 July 2017.Kim Si-eun, 49, at the Spam factory where she works in Jincheon, south of Seoul, on 28 August 2018, and Hong Kum-ju, 27, at the food factory where she works near Wonsan on 11 April 2017.Bang Sung-hee, a tour guide, on the viewing deck of the 63 Building in Seoul on 8 September 2017, and Choi Hee-ok, also a tour guide, on the viewing deck of the Juche Tower in Pyongyang on 28 November 2016.Retired R Adm Park Sae-hun holding a placard during a rally in Seoul demanding the redeployment of US tactical nuclear weapons in South Korea, on 12 September 2017, and Ri Kum-hui after a military parade and mass rally on Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang on 15 April 2017.• This article was amended on 20 September 2018 to correctly identify Jenni Lim and Ri Young-hwa in their corresponding photos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05b46866ad5d0cc446f63cd18209d70a7b1f94ed/533_953_4853_2912/master/4853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e2a6fb4bb1062d122c00bff0b95ff23","title":"romanians in london brexit immigration photo essay","story":" meets members of the second largest community of British immigrants, who share their concerns ahead of Brexit in an uncertain climateby  Lisa O\u0027Carroll and  Sean SmithRomanians recently overtook the Irish and Indians as the second biggest immigrant community in the UK, but they are among the most vulnerable in the country after Brexit, according to a leading charity advocating for east Europeans in the UK.Many fill vital jobs that keep Britain’s supermarket shelves stocked, the elderly in care homes fed, and hotel rooms clean, but there have been fears that social and economic isolation among those in the low-skills sector would prove a calamitous mix for the many who would wish to remain in the country after Brexit.“The majority of EU citizens are not very well informed about Brexit and the settled status and Romanians are no exception. The language barrier, the fact that most of Romanian citizens don’t follow UK media at all, makes them quite vulnerable,” says Florina Tudose, an outreach worker with the East European Resource Centre, which has repeatedly raised concerns with the Home Office.“From our field research and extensive outreach within the Romanian community, we’ve noticed that many Romanians think that the settled status will be an automatic process, that as long as they pay taxes and are law-abiding citizens, everything is going to be OK,” she says. accompanied Tudose to meet some of the Romanians in communities in two areas of north London and found these fears were borne out.One woman, in her 40s, in a Romanian butcher’s shop explained she had no worries about Brexit.“I lived in Italy for 17 years, I didn’t know if I was illegal, nobody cared, I wasn’t stopped once, why should it be any different here?,” she says.Others wrongly believed the Home Office knew who they were and, as long as they paid taxes, registration would be automatic.“They will send us letters,” one 20-something shop assistant tells Tudose. “I am not worried at all about Brexit, why should I be? I’ve been here nine years and pay taxes and they will see that,” she says, betraying an alarming lack of knowledge about the Home Office plans or the consequences of not registering, which could include deportation or denial of re-entry into the country after a holiday.“Sadly,” says Tudose, “You hear this a lot. How are the Home Office going to get to these people? This is why we are worried.”A closer look at the Romanians interviewed by the  reveal that all have come to Britain to better their lives, not to take benefits.Several parents tell heartbreaking stories about leaving children behind with grandparents, so desperate have they been to provide for their families.Others complained that British people were ignorant about Romania and Romanians, with one protesting: “if Romania is as bad as the British think why has Prince Charles bought so much property there?”“What will England do without us?” says Dragoș, who works in a Romanian restaurant in Dollis Hill, north London, an area popular with Romanians.He was lured to the UK from Germany by a large nursing home group in November 2016.“It wasn’t fair. Last year in November, December, during the bad weather, they all called in to say they couldn’t come in. There was only two centimetres of snow. I had to take my car and personally pick up other Romanians. We couldn’t not go to work. These are elderly people, some have dementia, in my country you are one with the elderly, you have responsibilities and you get that drummed into you. Our work ethic and sense of responsibility is higher than it is here.”Asked what he thinks the British think about Romanians, Dragoș says elliptically. “Every shepherd has its black sheep, so do countries.” He is referring to the “criminals” in his community, who he says give “Romanians a bad name”.He shows me videos of fancy cars and lavish mansions in his town Țăndărei, known as the “Beverley Hills for Romanian gangsters”. It is a narrative that fits well with Brexiters and one that is often heard in the Romanian community, says Tudose.Dragoș, like others, sees himself as a highly mobile worker feeding his family back home where his wife and seven-year-old daughter still live.“We don’t have any future in Romania because of the corruption,” he says.Over the past 20 years Dragoș has lived in Greece, Cyprus, Belgium, Holland, Malta, Italy and Germany. He speaks five languages and thinks Britain would “be in trouble” if it pulled up the drawbridge to EU citizens.“Where will they get the women for all the low-skilled jobs?” If we go home, who is going to do the jobs? It is a bit racist, but it is their own decision. We are all here to work, we pay taxes, to pay rent, we pay insurance, buy food, pay bank fees. There will be a price to pay.”Hannah, who declined to be photographed or named, has been in Britain for two years and she is considering going home as she has only one friend in London.She typifies the type of hard unsung work that is done on a daily basis by EU workers, mainly east European, to keep the shelves full in supermarkets, the rooms clean in hotels and the streets free of rubbish.She worked for 18 months in Aldi in Swindon shifting crates of chilled food.Hannah says: “The job was terrible. It was very hard work, in a warehouse kept at between zero and two degrees. You had to work very hard every day, must pick up 2,000 boxes, boxes of milk, pizza, cooked meats, juice, yoghurt.“I had a target per hour to pick up 300 cases, if you do not make that target you go home.“You were put on trial for three months and if you didn’t make the 300 crates per hour every day you didn’t get a job. I was determined to get the job so I picked up 400 crates an hour, more than I needed.”In her 18 months in the warehouse she says there was just one British worker. “He lasted three days.”She hated the job she says and she was lonely, but she did it for the money, £12 an hour.In a good week she could make close to £500, more than the monthly wage in Romania but the tyranny of poor employment options made it impossible to leave.“It was a good rate, but one day I looked at myself in the safety shoes, gloves and hi-vis jacket and thought: I’m a healthy bright woman I can’t believe I am doing this.” She thought of going into cleaning, but then realised at £7 an hour “it wasn’t much”.Roxy, as she is known, with a masters degree in agricultural engineering under her belt, first came to Britain for adventure. She has been working on the harvests in a berry farm in Kent since 2010. She didn’t intend to stay, but like many EU citizens in Britain, has settled here.She is earning good money compared with what she could make back home, but she’s fed up with the way Romanians are treated, not on the farm, but by the wider community and is unsure of her future here.She says: “I am happy here, I just don’t like it when people say: ‘You are Romanian, you come here just to take our jobs, you are gypsies, you take benefits’.“I have not taken £1 here without working for it. Any English person who comes here and asks for a job at the farm, will get a job with open arms, but they are not coming and still people in this country say we are stealing their jobs.”Was she surprised by the vote to leave the EU?“No,” she says, “because you can see it on people’s faces. They hate us. In the supermarket you see how they look at you when they hear you speak Romanian, it’s better just to shut up. They do not like us.”Roxy says she has not experienced racism and stresses that her employers and all the English people on the farm “treat everyone equally”. The raspberry and soft fruit farm’s owner has frequently expressed fears that he will not be able to recruit staff after Brexit.But she says the perception of Romanians in Britain is otherwise ugly.“British people say they are not racist, but they think we are here as slaves just because we do this work and then they treat us like that. I don’t speak for me or mean the farm, but the general people.”She says fewer Romanians are now coming to Britain as word has got back that it is not all a bed of roses for agricultural workers, despite the lure of good money.Roxy, who is a team leader in the Kent berry farm, says she needs 20 more people to cope with this year’s crop “but they don’t come here” – British or eastern Europeans. “They don’t like the rain, the mud, the hard work”.“If they want to come here to work hard, yes, they should come. But if they want to come here because of some romantic dream, no, it is hard, it is not easy, you’re not in your own country, British people are grumpy and cold towards you.”Roxy arrived in the UK after the principle agricultural recruitment agency Concordia, offered her a job after she graduated with a primary degree in agronomy .At the time a first job in Romania would have earned her £300 a month and with the promise of the same amount a week in England, she made the journey to Kent. It was hard work, but an exciting adventure, she explains.Her day starts at 4am, when she gets up at the house she shares with her boyfriend in Sittingbourne. She is on the farm at 5.45am to lead her team of 40 through aisles and aisles of raspberry plants under polytunnels.Then have a 15-minute tea break at 8.30am and continue to 11am when they have 30 minutes for lunch with a further tea break at 1.30pm. Normally the day ends at 3pm but with so much produce, they continue for another hour during the peak harvest.By the time Roxy gets home at around 6pm she just has time to “shower, cook and eat and then go to bed around 8.30pm to 9.30pm”.Despite the gruelling hours, she appreciates her life in Britain. She says: “I would like to stay here, it’s already our home in a way, but this Brexit, we are not sure we want to make a life here.“Do we want to get a mortgage? We could get one, but next year they could say we can’t stay here, so we have no security.“Sometimes you just want to pack your bags and leave and say: ‘Okay, I’ve had enough’.”It wasn’t easy for Cristina to leave Romania – she needed to make money and had to leave her daughter at home in order to make it work.“It was really hard. I didn’t know anyone here,” she says.“I didn’t know much about Britain. I knew something about the Queen, I knew it was expensive, but that I would earn more money here.“Then when I got here I realised it was not so easy to save.”When asked if the savings are for her daughter, Cristina begins to cry. “It is very hard to be here without her. I need the money for her school. It is a very sensitive subject. It is a big sacrifice.“It is why I am here to pay for my daughter to have private music, to learn foreign languages, she’s also learning taekwondo.“If I wasn’t here she would have none of these things. I am doing this for her. I would like her to come here but because of Brexit I cannot be certain. She is in primary school now. I’m not going to bring her here and then we find out we have to leave,” she says.Life is still hard for Cristina, but better than back home, she believes.She lives in a shared house with six people, each in a room of their own.Living on the outskirts of London costs £600 a month in rent and she hardly ever goes out to socialise or see the sights in the capital as she works from 7am to 7pm six days a week.“I see this as a time in my life I have to make sacrifices,” she says.Moving back to Bucharest wouldn’t make economic sense. She would have to pay £400 a month in rent and would never earn enough money for her daughter and 72-year-old dad, who is on a pension of €200 (£180) a month.“He couldn’t survive without my money,” she says.Does Brexit make her feel unsettled? “It depends on whether I can work any more, but I’m not scared about it.”She hasn’t heard of “settled status” immigration ID, which would be mandatory under current proposals for all EU citizens, bar the Irish, from summer 2021.“Everyone is very confused. I think that’s because of the people in charge,” she suggests.Cristina doesn’t read Romanian or British newspapers or media, where Brexit is headline news every day, because it makes her “anxious”.When Tudose explains what settled status is she says she is willing to apply for it but predicts there is going to be a lot of fraud, people looking to borrow passports and national insurance numbers to get the new identity.Ultimately she hopes to return home, but for now her daughter and father need her wages in London.Sebi, as he is known, has just arrived in London to work in a Romanian butcher’s shop in Burnt Oak. He stands at the counter, while his boss is telling the East European Resource Centre about hate crime that morning when two women shouted at them “to go home” in the lane beside his shop.Sebi, like Cristina, came to Britain to give his child, a 13-year-old-boy, a better life.“I want to secure a future for him, to send him to university.”He is from Botoșani, the poorest part of Romania, and the lack of work prompted him to leave years ago.He has worked on markets selling vegetables all his life, but in Romania he was earning just £8 a day “and that would be on a good day”, Sebi says.He adds: “I lived in a village outside the town with my son and parents and would have to pay for the bus out of that as well as buy utilities, food and clothes.”In London he hopes to earn around £1,200 a month, of which £300 is committed to a single room in a house share, gas and electricity on top of that would still leave him with enough to repatriate, if he does not spend money on going out.He is now on a trial work period at the shop but is full of hope for what he can earn his family. “I am willing to work hard. I want to stay 20 years here until my retirement.”Like Cristina, he tends to stay in the area and has seen none of the treasures of London’s museums and galleries, restaurants and shops, or the capital’s nightlife.“I am afraid to spend money right now,” he says.He hadn’t heard of Brexit and it was a friend who hooked him up with the Burnt Oak job.If he wasn’t in London, he would be somewhere else in Europe earning for his parents and son. He spent a year in Turkey and two years working in a market in Poland.Brexit has changed everything for east Europeans, says Cristina.“When I came to the country, everybody spoke normally to you. There was no big difference if you had papers or not. People just treated you as people and liked immigrants. We worked hard and cleaned properly. British people didn’t know how to clean.“Now, 18 years on and we have all the rights to work, people treat you like an animal,” she says.But she says British people have never tried to understand Romania.“Somebody asked me a few years ago: ‘Did we have TV in Romania?’ I asked them do they own two properties. If Romania is so bad why does Prince Charles love it so much?” she says, quickly doing a Google search on her phone to show his health retreat in the bucolic Transylvania.Cristina says she has not been subjected to racial abuse, but her friends have, particularly those living outside London. “The day after the referendum, they said people said they didn’t want to serve us.”She thinks that many Romanians have returned home because London is now so expensive to rent and because of the uncertainty of Brexit.Christina says: “Now everyone is so scared. People from Bulgaria, Ukraine, Lithuania, Poland, because they do not know what is going to happen.“I tell people it will be okay and they say: ‘No, you need permanent residency, you could be stopped, you could be deported.’”She managed chambermaids for three years in the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch, London, and then in a rubber factory in Doncaster where she was paid £10 an hour.Christina, who is from the city of Târgoviște, came into the country with a sports team in 2001 on a 15-day tourist visa and went on to spend most of her life in the UK in cleaning jobs, working in hotels as well as jobs in coffee chains.“The standard of cleaning by British workers was so bad,” she says in reference to one hotel in Stansted where she worked. “The floor manager was English and she didn’t care about the standard of cleaning.” Romanians care and make people come back to clean properly if rooms are not done right.”Like many Romanians interviewed by the , Cristina left her child behind to come to Britain to make a better life for her son. She was here for two-and-a-half years before he could join her.“It was so hard to leave him. I didn’t want to do it. I had days when I just did my job and I would cry all day,” she says.But she was determined she wanted her son to have something better and after a stint in London went to Barcelona, Spain, and then they went back to Romania in 2009 and opened some food shops.A year later they returned to London to run a restaurant in Dollis Hill with her husband and her two children.She has not heard of the settled status scheme that the Home Office was about to launch, but says London is where she intends to stay while her younger child remains in school.“I don’t have an option. We are going to Romania on holiday, my son says: ‘Mum, when are we going to go home?’”Ovidiu is said to be one of the best known Romanians in the community in Britain, having lived in the country for nearly 40 years. He risked his life to escape the terrors of Romania’s communist dictatorship in 1979.He speaks seven languages, has a thriving bakery business in north London and was once a partner in a chain of pizzerias.But his arrival on a boat from eastern Europe was pure fluke.His wife had died in an accident leaving him with five small children, the youngest just six months old, to bring up on his own. After six years as a widow, and with the Ceaușescu regime in its first flushes of dictatorship, he decided his best chance was to leave the country be secreting himself on a ship heading to Freiberg in Germany, where he had some friends.“The truth is 1979-1980 were really hard,” he says.While on board, the ship was rechartered and he ended up in Turkey and then – by chance – in Kent, having lost half his body weight as a stowaway.“It was a huge risk. We had political prisons. You could have been sentenced to 15 years in a labour camp or disappeared.”He went straight to Amnesty and after three weeks he got a job in the Basel St Hotel behind Harrods in London, giving him a start in the hospitality trade that was to last decades.As for Brexit, he says: “I don’t know if the government is prepared. Romanians work everywhere, in hospitals, coffee shops, garbage, they work in Asda, Iceland, some are in good positions, working in management, in homes for the elderly. The English aren’t going to take those jobs. They won’t do the shit jobs.”“I think Brexit is done to get rid of all the people on benefits,” he adds, and goes on to complains about fellow Romanians who come to the UK to take advantage – as he sees it – of the British system. “I have five children and am a single parent but I did not take any benefit for all that time. People can be entitled to benefits but the English government doesn’t check.”Theology postgraduate Cătălin has been in the UK on and off since 2006, initially on a seasonal agriculture workers’ scheme which allowed temporary immigration from Bulgaria and Romania ahead of full accession to the EU.He and his wife are now British citizens and will be here at least until they retire.Cătălin believes the UK seasonal work is less attractive, largely because the pound is so weak. In 2006 the pound would buy €1.46. Now it will buy just €1.12 and the price of accommodation and food has gone up.But the big appeal for Cătălin was a career. He progressed from picker, to supervisor, to team leader to line manager and is now a farm manager, running a £7m turnover section of the berry fields where he manages a team of 260 people.He is from a middle-class family who could afford to send their son to university, but Cătălin says such a career trajectory would not have existed at home. “Here I could build a career on my own steam. In Romania you need to know someone to help you. You would never have become a farm manager in 12 years,” he says.From the beginning the money was relatively attractive with wages of £350-£380 a week on the fruit farm in Herefordshire compared with the £200 a month on offer in Romania.“With the money I was able to buy land in Romania, plant cherry trees, renovate my father’s house, buy new furniture and put in central heating,” he says.“When I think of Britain then, the prices of food and fuel were lower, you could buy a lot more and save a lot more. There was never any racism towards us.”Cătălin thought he would eventually go home but a growing family and a good career made him rethink his plans, and he became a British citizen – an expensive insurance policy he took out against Brexit.He paid £1,273 for each application, plus £150 each for the English test and £50 each for the life in the UK test. Not a trifling figure. “I was quite stressed about it, I took it very seriously,” he says. “It was a lot of money. I paid taxes for 12 years and just to secure my future I had to pay that.”He works hard but he likes his life in a quiet village in the West Country. “It’s clean, there are plenty of green areas and parks and we have friends in towns around here.”Many Romanians are returning: Cătălin has a friend who runs a haulage company which cannot hire drivers and the economy back home is getting stronger.

If registered as foreign agents, Xinhua and CGTN would have to disclose their budgets and expenditures as well as include disclaimers identifying the outlets as foreign agents on all broadcasts.“Countries should perceive media’s role in promoting international exchange and cooperation in an open and inclusive spirit,” Geng said at a news briefing. “They need to facilitate rather than obstruct media’s normal work, still less politicising their role.”The news comes as relations between the US and China have hit a low over an escalating trade war. Geng’s comments also struck some as ironic, given China’s often restrictive media environment.Last month, the US embassy in Beijing said it was “deeply concerned” when a US journalist for Buzzfeed News, known for her reporting on human rights abuses in Xinjiang, was denied a visa to continue working in China. Other foreign journalists have also been effectively barred.Last year, Russia’s state-run RT Television was ordered to register under Fara after a US intelligence report said RT and the website Sputnik news were part of a misinformation campaign during the 2016 US presidential election.Chinese media operating in the US have not been accused of interference, but critics cite expanding efforts to influence public opinion through Chinese and English-language news from Chinese state outlets.Paid inserts of the government-run China Daily have appeared in major newspapers such as the New York Times and the Washington Post. CGTN has claimed it reaches 30m US households a year. In 2016, Xinhua paid for a mega-screen in New York’s Times Square that played a video promoting “China’s historical role and standing in the South China Sea” on loop.In January, a group of US senators including Marco Rubio and Patrick Leahy wrote to the US asking the Department of Justice to assess whether state-controlled Chinese media should be registered under Fara.They also asked the department to assess whether the dissemination of Chinese state media, including the inserts from the China Daily and the use of social media, complied with the law. Both Xinhua and CGTN have Facebook pages.Citing a report last year from the National Endowment for Democracy, the senators said China was exploiting “glaring asymmetry” by raising barriers to external political and cultural influence at home while simultaneously taking advantage of the openness of democratic systems abroad.”The US Department of Justice has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b9836a84116c48abee03d8745412d81fe7a197d/0_183_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45c9c5714c8a52d517cf84ae49df7ed6","title":"brussels urged to investigate czech pm over business empire","story":"Andrej Babiš’s Agrofert given €75m of EU subsidies in 2017, prompting conflict claimsBrussels is being urged to investigate the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, over an alleged conflict of interest after transparency campaigners claimed new evidence of rule-breaking.Babiš, a billionaire businessman, who founded the Action for Dissatisfied Citizens party, became prime minister of the Czech Republic last December, but was soon embroiled in a scandal centred on alleged €2m EU subsidy fraud.The latest allegations, from Transparency International, go further by putting the spotlight on his entire Agrofert business empire, a conglomerate of 230 companies ning food, chemicals and media. Agrofert has rejected the claims as false.When he was finance minister in 2017, Babiš put Agrofert into a trust, to comply with new Czech legislation against conflicts of interest. But campaigners at Transparency International say he remains the “beneficial owner” of Agrofert in breach of domestic and EU law. They say the claim is based on research of company documents in Slovakia, as the Czech equivalents are not available to the public.“On one hand he is sitting in EU meetings, where he decides about the subsidies in his pocket,” said David Ondráčka, director of Transparency International in the Czech Republic. “And at the same time he uses these subsidies to fund his political career, where he is dominating over his opponents.”The Czech Republic is one of the biggest per-capita recipients of EU funds, along with Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. Agrofert received 1.9bn Czech crowns (£68m) of EU subsidies in 2017, three times more than in 2012, according to Transparency International.The allegations come amid tensions between Europe’s traditional parties and anti-establishment rivals that are often critical of the EU, but want to keep European funds flowing. Questions have been growing over cronyism in Hungary, as it emerged Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán’s friends and family had been awarded public tenders worth millions.Agrofert rejected in a three-page statement what it called the “false claims” made by Transparency International, which it argued were based on a misinterpretation of the term “final beneficiary” in Slovak law.“Andrej Babiš has no rights that would allow him … any decisive influence on the administration of the trusts,” it said. “Mr Babiš is not in breach of the Act on conflict of interest.”In an emailed statement to the  on Wednesday, Babiš said: “Transparency International spreads nonsense and keeps coming with such statements when there is a European summit or other events just like today when I travel to Salzburg.”He said he had put the company in a private trust fund and given up his business before entering politics in 2014.He also accused Transparency International of running a politically motivated campaign against him and being “easily influenced” because it received funding from the EU and ministries led by the Social Democrats, the junior party in his coalition – and political competitors.“TI does not have any evidence for their words because there cannot be any evidence. I fully respect the law,” he said.

Moon was fulfilling a long-held dream to visit Mount Paektu, which straddles the border between North Korea and China. At the summit the two men held hands and thrust them into the air as they posed for a photo with their wives, the lake in the background.The highly symbolic trip capped a three-day visit by Moon to North Korea, the first by a South Korean leader in 11 years. After two days of talks, Kim pledged to close a missile testing site that was crucial to North Korea’s development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and offered to shut the country’s only known nuclear complex in exchanged for unspecified “reciprocal measures” from the US.Observers said these measure fell short of expectations in Washington. But inter-Korean relations continue to grow closer, and the trip to Paektu highlighted the close relationship between the two leaders. Moon is an avid hiker and during his first meeting with Kim, in April, he had expressed his desire to visit the mountain, the highest on the Korean peninsula at 2,500 metres (9,000ft).“I have a dream that I have not been able to fulfil for a long time, which is trekking Mount Paektu,” Moon said at the time. “I believe Chairman Kim will make that dream come true for sure.”The trip to the summit on a sunny morning was less of a trek than a photo op. Both Kim and Moon wore black overcoats and black leather dress shoes, and they travelled to the top by cable car. Outings like this have helped build trust between the two men, something Kim still lacks in his relationship with Donald Trump.The mountain is featured heavily in North Korean propaganda, and Kim has made trips to its summit after nuclear tests or major announcements, most recently when he declared the country’s nuclear arsenal complete. North Korea’s two previous leaders, Kim’s grandfather and father, are said to have been born in its shadow. This has been used to bolster the Kim family’s claim to a sacred bloodline, though the account has been disputed by some.Paektu is also a significant symbol in the South, where it is mentioned in the country’s national anthem. Although Moon could have visited the summit sooner from the Chinese side, he had wanted to go by “stepping on our soil”, Kim Eui-kyeom, a South Korean presidential spokesman, said at a briefing.Moon was scheduled to fly back to Seoul on Thursday afternoon and he will meet Trump in New York next week during the UN general assembly. The US has invited North Korea’s foreign minister to meet the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, next week in an attempt to restart talks between Washington and Pyongyang."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8cfb9ce5a486c5b8771506b7d9521b7edac4b5/0_180_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce975b8f102bcc669e9226d31a7702b0","title":"israelis experience slice of virtual reality of palestinian home life","story":"‘The under-layer is very tragic,’ says artist whose living rooms expose deep ideAn art exhibition in Jerusalem that gives Israelis the chance to experience a Palestinian family’s living room – by wearing virtual reality goggles – has laid bare the entrenched separation of two societies that live side by side but, increasingly, worlds apart.The Israel Museum, where the exhibition is being held, is less than two miles from Arab neighbourhoods in Jerusalem where thousands of Palestinians live. And it is only six miles from the West Bank village where the family who agreed to be filmed for the project live.“On the surface, the exhibition is not threatening, it’s almost even naive. But I think the under-layer is very tragic, disappointing,” the artist, Daniel Landau, said.It is part of a exhibition in the museum’s youth wing that explores human encounters, with other works placing the spotlight on the impact of smartphones on relationships or interactions with strangers in the street.Landau’s room, called “Visitors”, has been sliced down the middle, with one side decorated like the home of a Jewish family and the other as a Palestinian home. Virtual reality glasses give visitors a 360-degree view of the homes and they can listen to stories from family members.More than 200,000 people have visited in the past three months, said Landau, who has often gone to hear feedback. “The initial response is that they say: ‘I’ve never been into an Arab house. I’ve never met Arab people. I’m surprised to see how family-like they are.’”Israelis and Palestinians – societies that once knew each other intimately – have never been as physically ided as they are today. After two intifadas, Israeli military crackdowns and ensuing bloodshed, there have been moves for complete separation.Israel has built a concrete barrier and barred most Palestinians from entering. It has banned its own citizens from entering Palestinian-controlled West Bank cities. Gaza, which is geographically disconnected from the West Bank, has been put under blockade and few can leave.Even in Israel’s majority-Arab cities, and in Jerusalem, there is little interaction between neighbours. Palestinian anti-Israel boycott movements have gathered strength and among Israelis, “coexistence” is often considered a politically loaded and isive term.The two families Landau filmed for the project live just tens of metres apart but have never met because they are separated by the wall that ides the West Bank. Landau said the Palestinian family had been granted special permits to travel into Israel to visit the museum this month.Inspired by his experience of growing up in a Jewish Jerusalem area where he had a friend in a nearby Palestinian village, Landau had hoped to find families there for his project, but he said the situation was too tense.A large part of the work, Landau said, was to touch on internal rifts in Israeli society, namely its Jewish population from the Middle East and north Africa whose “Arabness” had been sidelined.Mizrahi Jews were expelled from Arab countries or chose to immigrate to Israel after its creation. But they have long faced economic, cultural and political marginalisation from the Ashkenazi elite of European origin.This had led to an “impossibility encapsulated in the Israeli society. This kind of lovehate. This kind of appreciation for the east but actually a sort of rejection.“It’s the story of the Arab Jew. Half of us are very connected to Arab culture, language, music, mentally,” he said. “That’s what I wish we could bring – more empathy, accepting to the local culture. The potential of what could happen when we cooperate. Rather than bringing western values, consumer culture into this meeting point.”Landau said he noticed that Mizrahi Jews who experienced the virtual reality homes had felt nostalgic. “They say: ‘That’s how my grandfather used to decorate his house, that’s how he used to talk about his kids.’”Raji Sebteen, 55, the Palestinian man who had his home and family filmed for the project, said the exhibition was a “good way to ask others to believe in peace”.“It’s a good feeling,” he said, when asked about the thousands of Israelis who had now seen inside his home.“You have to understand that people are fearful. They are scared because of the situation … because of mistrust planted inside them, it is not easy,” he said, adding that any Israeli would be welcome to visit his home in real life.Ido Harari, a 43-year-old Israeli academic visiting the museum with his young daughters, said hostility had grown between both sides and attempts to return to a pre-state situation where Arabs and Jews mingled was “a bit romantic”.“I don’t know how much it is based on actual possibilities we have today. I have Arab acquaintances, not Arab friends, unfortunately. I don’t know if you would get invited,” he said.“Me and my friends are on the left side of the left wing. We don’t think of ourselves as Zionists. Our goal is one state with Jews and Arabs living as equals together. Still, most of our friends, they are not close friends with Arabs.”As his eight-year-old held the goggles up to her face, Harari said: “My daughter is really excited about this room. So it probably works.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa56215d40211f05222509acd1a60b8173fc763/0_0_5079_3047/master/5079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba6d406a74347b2a4723f575757645eb","title":"seven in 10 eu workers in uk would be barred under brexit proposals","story":"Most would not meet migration advisory committee’s guidelines in future, says IPPRThe majority of EU workers in the UK would not be eligible to work in the country following Brexit if they were subject to proposals put forward by the government’s chief migration advisers, analysis by a leading leftwing thinktank shows.EU citizens currently in the UK are expected to be protected under the terms of the UK-EU withdrawal agreement but findings by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) illustrate how proposals by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) will potentially restrict businesses recruiting migrants from the EU in future.In its report on EU migration after Brexit, published on Tuesday, the committee recommended lifting the cap on highly skilled workers applying to take up jobs in the UK but also backed maintaining the salary threshold of £30,000.The committee also recommended only allowing in iniduals at level three or above on the nine-level regulated qualifications framework (RQF).The findings will likely enflame concerns from business leaders over proposals they have already branded “ignorant and elitist”.Marley Morris, IPPR’s senior research fellow, said: “The new proposals from the migration advisory committee would have a dramatic impact on the UK’s labour force and on employers. Our analysis suggests that a large majority of migrants from the EU employed in the UK would not meet the criteria proposed by the MAC.Officially known as the European Union (withdrawal agreement) bill, this will be the primary piece of legislation to enact the agreement the UK secures to leave the EU, and the ensuing transition period.That depends on what the final deal is. A white paper published on Tuesday mainly takes in areas already dealt with by the initial agreement with the EU – reciprocal citizens’ rights, the transition period, and the orce bill.Only after parliament has approved the deal negotiated with the EU. It must then be passed before 29 March 2019, so the withdrawal agreement has legal effect.Dominic Raab, the new Brexit secretary, reiterated his warning the UK could withhold the £39bn final settlement if the EU fails to agree a trade deal. He also said there would be “no wholesale removal of rights of EU nationals” if there was no deal. He also said the implementation bill would reinstate parts of the European Communities Act – which first took the UK into the then common market – which is being repealed by the EU Withdrawal Act, so EU law can still apply during the transition.“While of course EU citizens currently in the UK will be protected by the UK-EU withdrawal agreement, the MAC’s recommendations would have significant implications for future EU migrants. Overall, these proposals would see a major shake-up for our immigration system, with sectors such as hospitality, logistics and wholesale feeling the squeeze.”Morris said the IPPR would support a different approach to managing migration post-Brexit. “Rather than simply cutting off low-skilled EU labour, the government should consider ways to incentivise employers to pay more and train more, by offering advantages in the visa system to responsible businesses,” he said.The MAC report shut down a wide range of claims made about the impact of immigration in the run-up to the Brexit referendum.The experts found that the overall impact of migration from the European Economic Area was “small in magnitude when set against other changes”, adding that “migrants have no or little impact” on the employment or unemployment outcomes of the UK-born workforce, and that migration does not force down wages to “any great extent”.The advisers also found that the fall of the pound after the referendum, driven by uncertainty over the future of the UK economy, has had a larger impact on wages and employment opportunities than migration ever did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad3070511f1d86d20c49c1eb3cd50b0e5b646d04/0_1329_3648_2186/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07ac56feb66cba9e9748226ae9eab167","title":"shinzo abe set to be japans longest serving pm after winning party vote","story":"Reelection as Liberal Democratic leader means Abe is likely to overtake previous record and use mandate to revise pacifist constitutionAbe’s victory – taking 553 votes out of a total of 807 – means he is assured of continuing as prime minister and is expected to use his mandate to push ahead with controversial plans to strengthen the legal status of Japan’s military, known as the self-defence forces.Speaking on the eve of the vote among LDP MPs and party members, Abe said he was determined to “build a new country together”, adding: “I promise to take the lead in handing over a proud and hopeful Japan to younger generations.”Abe, a conservative who has devoted his political career to loosening the postwar shackles on the self-defence forces, easily beat his nearest rival, former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, who had voiced concern that the country had not been given enough time to debate constitutional reform.Abe’s victory on Thursday effectively extends his term in office by another three years. If he is still in office in November 2019 he will overtake Taro Katsura, who was leader for 2,886 days – spread over three terms – in the early 1900s.Abe, who has survived two cronyism scandals, spent a tumultuous year in office from late 2006, but has not lost an election since he became prime minister for a second time in December 2012.He has quietly dropped plans for a comprehensive revision to the war-renouncing clause in the constitution, insisting he simply wants to confirm the legality of the self-defence forces, which are not recognised by the current document.He has also said he would retain passages that forbid Japan from waging a war of aggression.Article 9 of the current constitution, authored by US occupation forces at the end of the second world war, renounces war and forbids the use of force to settle international disputes.Abe, however, redefined the military’s role three years age with the passage of a law allowing it to take part in collective-self defence. In theory, that means Japanese troops could come to the aid of an ally under attack even if its own territory is not threatened.The constitutional change would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Japanese Diet and a simple majority in a national referendum.Any move to strengthen the military’s status could damage Abe’s standing, however, particularly among older voters who have formed an emotional attachment to their country’s postwar pacifism.The change could also test Tokyo’s relationship with South Korea and China, both victims of Japanese militarism in the first half of the 20th century.Analysts pointed out that most voters were more concerned about the economy and population decline.“They simply do not see revision as a top priority for the government and Diet,” said Tobias Harris, a Japan expert at Teneo Intelligence in Washington, adding that constitutional revision was a “costly distraction that could trigger a backlash vote”.Wire agencies contributed to this report."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3635602.1537428701!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and may meet amid stark divisions over irish border","story":"British prime minister Theresa May, arriving at an EU summit dinner in Austria, has called on fellow European Union leaders to follow her lead and adapt their Brexit negotiating stance to get a good deal. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Theresa May and Leo Varadkar attend a bilateral meeting during the informal summit of European Union leaders in Salzburg, Austria on Thursday. Photograph: Leonhard FoegerReuters A bi-lateral meeting between Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and British prime minister Theresa May has begun in Salzburg this morning.Last night stark isions over Brexit and the future of the Irish Border were evident at an EU summit in Salzburg as Ms May told fellow leaders that a border on the Irish Sea was “simply not acceptable” to her.Mr Varadkar told reporters that no progress had been made on the backstop since March and that the Government was making preparations for a no-deal outcome in the talks on the UK’s departure from the bloc.“I don’t think anyone wants to contemplate a no-deal scenario,” he said. “I don’t believe a no-deal scenario is where we’re heading but certainly Ireland is prepared for it.“We’ve already started the process of hiring hundreds of people to staff our ports and airports. We’ve already started to approve the IT system, the infrastructure that may need to go into place. I want to emphasise that’s in the ports and airports for eastwest trade. We’re not making any preparations for a hard border.”Ahead of the dinner, sources said Ms May would tell her fellow leaders that: “It has been clear from the outset that we can never accept a border on the Irish Sea. . . A customs border would undermine our constitutional position.”She was also expected to say that “the commission is proposing I should assent to legal separation of the UK into two customs territories. That is simply not acceptable”.This was seen as a response to attempts by the chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier to “de-dramatise” the issue of controls on the Irish Sea in the event of Northern Ireland remaining part of the customs union and single market after Brexit.Mr Barnier has insisted in recent weeks that such controls need not take place on the Border or be seen as a border, or have any implications for the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.Ms May was having none of it, with sources saying she remained solidly committed to the British pledge in December to a “backstop” for Northern Ireland, which both sides differ sharply on the shape of.Sources close to the prime minister accepted, however, that London would be bringing forward proposals on the regulatory control dimension of their backstop proposals and did not rule out that some such controls could be carried out in the Irish Sea.On the overall deal Ms May was expected to reiterate her commitment to getting agreement.“We have a shared history, and shared challenges . . . and we have a desire for a shared future,” she said. “The onus is on all of us to get this deal done.”There were no responses at the dinner to Ms May’s speech, which will be discussed by the 27 remaining states at their lunch today after she leaves Salzburg.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryEPATo become a “normal country” is the dream of more than one republic. The world is familiar enough with the German case. Having atoned for the war and put Europe first, its next step as a common-or-garden nation is to pursue its narrow interests without embarrassment.Because he is so peculiar, we cannot credit that Donald Trump’s project is the normalisation of his own country. For all their shock value, that is what his foreign policies amount to: the restoration of the US as a selfish state among selfish states, not an overworked governess with the entire free world as her mewling wards.This realpolitik can be self-defeating. It misses the national interests that are served through such nominally high-minded works as the Paris climate accord. But it is still more coherent than its critics. Liberals chafed at American power until its threatened retreat, at which point Nato and the Washington Consensus on trade became sacraments to be saved from populist menaces. As for mainstream Republicans, at least Trump does not go in for mystical hokum about the US as a special nation ordained to uphold freedom.Realism has more going for it, though, than internal coherence. It also fits the external conditions. To lead a world order takes a nation in the full plumage of its powers. That is a better description of the US in 1948 than 2018, much less 2048. Trump’s infidelity to the postwar system is disquieting, but perhaps he is doing through choice what future presidents will have to do through necessity.Pax Americana is not the natural order of things. It is a phase born of the most extreme circumstances. The US accounted for a third of the world’s output when it set up the Bretton Woods institutions, revived Japan and secured Europe. Because its absolute power remained so awesome, we forget that its relative position began to decline soon after. It now accounts for about 20 per cent of global output. It does not have the wherewithal to underwrite the democratic world forever. At some point, a president was going to construe the national interest in narrower terms. The most recent three were elected on a pledge to do so.Whether Trump-as-statesman understands the relative decline he has lived through – he was born in 1946 – Trump-as-politician understands something just as relevant. The taxpayer still awaits the peace idend that was said to be in the mail when the Berlin Wall turned to debris.The US has spent most of the post-cold war era in expensive conflicts in another hemisphere. These “forever wars” rolled on as the home land endured a financial crash and the kind of infrastructure that should be beneath the dignity of the nation that built the Hoover dam.The two trends – relative decline and domestic exhaustion – have created the best atmosphere for realpolitik since the post-Vietnam years. The difference is that this time it should last, as China and other powers trim America’s room for manoeuvre.There is no demand for isolation. There is plenty for a focus on interests over values. Trump’s is the first (and therefore the worst) attempt to service that demand. There was no need to humiliate allies as blameless as Canada or to impose, as his government did this week, new limits on the annual intake of refugees. But the underlying logic of selfishness will outlast him.Realists smell a chance to temper the crudities of America First into a serious, interest-led, foreign policy. The foremost among their academic tribe, John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, each have books out to encourage their nation’s retirement from “liberal hegemony”.Even if the coming realism turns out to be an over-correction, a correction was due. Not long ago, George W Bush could describe freedom as the “design of nature” and Barack Obama could, with equal nonchalance, say that the arc of history bends towards justice. The arc of history does not bend towards anything.There are things to miss about these presidents – their personal class, their seasoned cabinets – but this teleological gibberish is not one of them. The postwar record suggests that ideals get the US into trouble more often than cold calculation does.Richard Nixon said that a leader can, at most, “give history a nudge”. He or she cannot alter the course of history so much as quicken a trend that is already in train. The structural trends of the world demand a more self-interested US over time.Each of Trump’s broken treaties and tariff rounds can be read as a nudge towards that destiny: a bid to make America normal again.

It is an important caveat, but the declaration appeared to break the logjam in nuclear discussions with Washington.President Donald Trump welcomed the move, tweeting that Kim had agreed to allow Nuclear inspections, subject to final negotiations, adding: Very exciting!Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also praised the important commitments, saying he invited his North Korean counterpart to meet next week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and representatives of both sides to meet at the earliest opportunity in Vienna, home of the International Atomic Energy Agency.President Moon collects water from Lake Heaven at the bottom of Mount PaektuWashington was ready to engage immediately in negotiations to achieve the North\u0027s denuclearisation by January 2021, Pompeo added - the end of Trump\u0027s first term.The process had stalled after the historic Singapore summit between Trump and Kim in June, when Kim declared his backing for denuclearisation of the peninsula but no details were agreed.Washington and Pyongyang have subsequently sparred over what that means and how it will be achieved, with the Trump administration consistently referring to the denuclearisation of North Korea specifically.For its part, Pyongyang - which wants a formal declaration the 1950-53 Korean War is over - has condemned demands for its unilateral disarmament as gangster-like.Experts remain sceptical, pointing out that closing Tongchang-ri, also known as Sohae, would have no impact on the North\u0027s ability to manufacture rockets. Pyongyang has used several other locations for missile launches and has repeatedly said it has no need for further testing.Many also believe that apart from Yongbyon, the North also has covert nuclear facilities.The North Koreans are offering gestures that mimic disarmament, arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis tweeted. They don\u0027t meaningfully constrain North Korea\u0027s nuclear programme.Their main purpose, he added, was to appease Trump, so that Moon and Kim can keep their engagement alive.This is what an Israel-style deal looks like with North Korea: They pretend to disarm and we pretend to believe it.Moon and Kim have sought to strengthen the North-South relationship at their Pyongyang summit, agreeing that the North Korean leader will visit Seoul at an early date.It would be the first such trip by a North Korean leader since the Korean War ended in an armistice, leaving the peninsula ided by the Demilitarized Zone and technically still in a state of war, and Moon said the historic journey could happen later this year.The two leaders also agreed to open a permanent facility for family reunions, work towards joining up road and rail links, and bid jointly for the 2032 Olympics.At a performance of the North\u0027s spectacular Mass Games propaganda display, Moon made an unprecedented address by a South Korean leader to a Northern crowd, telling them that Koreans had lived together for 5,000 years.I propose we move forward toward the big picture of peace in which the past 70-year-long hostility can be eradicated and we can become one again, he said, prompting rapturous applause.On Thursday, Moon and Kim, accompanied by their wives, visited Mount Paektu on the Chinese border.Beyond the pomp and pageantry, Moon is keeping delicate denuclearisation talks with North Korea on trackThe 2,744-metre (9,003-foot) peak is considered sacred to all Koreans as the birthplace of Dangun, the legendary founder of the first Korean kingdom.According to Pyongyang\u0027s narrative, it is also where Kim Jong-un\u0027s father Kim Jong-il was born, at a secret camp where his own father, the North\u0027s founder Kim Il-sung, was fighting Korea\u0027s Japanese colonial occupiers. However, overseas historians say Kim Jong-il was born in the Soviet Union, where his father was in exile.South Korean tourists flock to see the mountain via China, but only a handful of Southerners have been granted access from the North Korean side, mostly for research purposes.Pictures showed Kim and Moon both in black coats on the crater rim, their clasped hands raised aloft, and the South Korean president expressed his hope that many of his countrymen would follow in his footsteps.Please review our commenting policyBrexit: EU leaders \u0026#39almost unanimous\u0026#39 in support for second UK referendum - latest newsChris Grayling admits he was \u0026#39wrong\u0026#39 to trust rail bosses over timetable overhaul following damning report by regulatorUK weather: More strong winds to batter Britain with \u0026#39danger to life warning\u0026#39 after Storm Ali kills twoAircraft forced to emergency land on residential Texas streetTom Watson suggests Jeremy Corbyn adviser is peddling \u0026#39fake news\u0026#39 over claim that secret service is trying to block a Labour government Leaked Tory dossier reveals secret plan to replace Theresa May in April and ranks her possible successors Ian Paisley avoids by-election by 400 votes after failing to declare Sri Lankan holidaysComment: May misses what Thatcher understood: people want a home of their ownSNP ministers \u0026#39unlikely\u0026#39 to meet target of superfast broadband for every home by 2021, says auditComment: Big tech\u0026#39s suppression of conservative voices is the greatest threat to free speech we faceComment: It is not just illegal immigrants who should be worried by the Trump administration\u0026#39s get tough policyShrewsbury baby scandal at maternity unit expands to 100 casesBritain is willing to walk away without a deal, Theresa May warns EU leaders in SalzburgSmoking will be \u0026#39eradicated in England by 2030\u0026#39This conference season, don\u0026#39t miss out on Front Bench, The \u0026#39s morning politics newsletterProblem with migrants?

The new chain\u0026nbsphas been the subject of weeks of speculation. It\u0026nbspis the result of more than two years of planning, working with over 350 supplier partners, and at a launch in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, on Wednesday, the focus was on the “Britishness” of the brand and lower prices. Jack’s will be the “cheapest in town”, according to the supermarket’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, through a combination of deals agreed with suppliers and lower operating costs at its pared back stores. “It’s very simple to run, it allows us to lower prices,” he said. Supply costs will be reduced due to changes to packaging, but no products will be supplied to Jack’s at a lower value than they are sold to Tesco, Mr Lewis said.The new stores will also offer a much smaller range of products than a traditional Tesco branch, with around 2,600 against the tens of thousands on sale in Tesco. Of the 2,600 product lines, 1,800 will be Jack’s own-brand. Meanwhile, eight out of ten products at Jack’s will be made, grown or reared in Britain, and most of the packaging reflects this, with Union Jacks adorning several items. This focus on Britishness has “nothing at all” to do with Brexit, Mr Lewis said, but reflects customers’ preference for locally sourced food and drink.Jack’s will be targeting “price sensitive customers”, and will\u0026nbspopen accordingly in areas with poorer populations.The Chatteris store has been created at a site previously earmarked for a new Tesco, which was mothballed four years ago, and the Immingham, Lincolnshire branch, which also opens on Thursday, uses a similar space. Of the 10 to 15 Jack’s shops planned for next year, five of them will be repurposed Tesco properties, some of which will be mothballed sites, but most of which will be current Tesco  stores.Tesco expected to launch new discount storesJamie Oliver is the new face of TescoCan Tesco\u0027s discounter Jack\u0027s succeed where others have failed? In terms of competing, Mr Lewis said he is not concerned about the risk of losing custom from Tesco to Jack’s: “I’d rather cannibalise myself than have somebody else cannibalise me.”As if to prove this belief, the company will open at least one Jack’s “right beside a Tesco”.In terms of competing with Aldi and Lidl, which are rapidly eating up market share in the highly competitive supermarket space, Jack’s will offer the lowest prices within the local area around each store, rather than competing on a national level. The new brand will not offer any online element, aside from an in-store app which will allow customers to scan products as they shop.The group said no jobs will be lost through the creation of Jack’s, although some staff took voluntary redundancy rather than staying on as Jack’s employees or moving to another Tesco site.The company said between 20 and 25 jobs will be created per new Jack’s store, meaning the total number of new roles created could reach 375.\u0026nbspHowever, the lower price offering will also mean lower wages for staff, Mr Lewis said, “because working conditions will be different”. Employees will be offered a base rate of pay, rather than the usual benefits package Tesco staff get. The Jack’s brand is being launched as part of the group’s centenary celebrations, and has been named in honour of Tesco founder Jack Cohen.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/10/13/university-graduates.jpg","title":"students clearing universities a level results day scramble degree places","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Universities feeling the pinch will have taken generous view of entry qualifications\u0026nbspto fill places\u0027Click to followThe IndependentA record number of students have taken up places on degrees through clearing this year, official figures show,\u0026nbspas universities were left scrambling to fill vacancies on courses. \u0026nbspOne month after A-level results day, 60,100 people have found places at British\u0026nbspuniversities using\u0026nbspthe process,\u0026nbspaccording to figures released by Ucas university admissions service.The number of students placed in a UK university after applying directly through clearing,\u0026nbsprather than through the main scheme,\u0026nbsprose by 6 per cent, from 13,640 last year to a record 14,410.Universities have been competing to attract would-be students amid a fall in applications, which has been fuelled by a decline in the UK’s 18-year-old population\u0026nbspand uncapped student numbers.This summer, there were still places available on degree courses at elite universities through clearing – as they\u0026nbsptried to recruit students who pay up to £9,250 a year in tuition fees.Professor\u0026nbspAlan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, told The Independent: “Universities lower down the pecking order will have been feeling the pinch and will have had to take a more generous view of entry qualifications in order to fill their places.”But he added that students would also have taken the opportunity to “trade up” through clearing – amid a falling population and a rise in university degree places on offer.“Tuition fee income is essential for universities to balance their books and in the circumstances I think that analysis would show that universities are both admitting applicants on lower A-level grades and taking a wider range of qualifications and experience into account,” he said.In total, 426,730 students from the UK were placed at UK universities – a drop of 3 per cent on the same point last year, the latest Ucas figures show.Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the higher education regulator Office for Students, said: “With record numbers of clearing places available and no cap on students numbers, prospective students can choose provision which suits their circumstances and ambition.“It’s important that universities and colleges consider how they can best improve the choice and flexibility of the courses they offer. Crucially, prospective students should have access to excellent information, advice and guidance in order to understand what options are available.\u0026nbspThis will help ensure that people from all ages and all backgrounds can make the most of the life-changing opportunities offered by higher education.”UK news in picturesStorm Ali has hit the British Isles bringing winds of up to 100mph.

The new chain\u0026nbsphas been the subject of weeks of speculation. It\u0026nbspis the result of more than two years of planning, working with over 350 supplier partners, and at a launch in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, on Wednesday, the focus was on the “Britishness” of the brand and lower prices. Jack’s will be the “cheapest in town”, according to the supermarket’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, through a combination of deals agreed with suppliers and lower operating costs at its pared back stores. “It’s very simple to run, it allows us to lower prices,” he said. Supply costs will be reduced due to changes to packaging, but no products will be supplied to Jack’s at a lower value than they are sold to Tesco, Mr Lewis said.The new stores will also offer a much smaller range of products than a traditional Tesco branch, with around 2,600 against the tens of thousands on sale in Tesco. Of the 2,600 product lines, 1,800 will be Jack’s own-brand. Meanwhile, eight out of ten products at Jack’s will be made, grown or reared in Britain, and most of the packaging reflects this, with Union Jacks adorning several items. This focus on Britishness has “nothing at all” to do with Brexit, Mr Lewis said, but reflects customers’ preference for locally sourced food and drink.Jack’s will be targeting “price sensitive customers”, and will\u0026nbspopen accordingly in areas with poorer populations.The Chatteris store has been created at a site previously earmarked for a new Tesco, which was mothballed four years ago, and the Immingham, Lincolnshire branch, which also opens on Thursday, uses a similar space. Of the 10 to 15 Jack’s shops planned for next year, five of them will be repurposed Tesco properties, some of which will be mothballed sites, but most of which will be current Tesco  stores.Tesco expected to launch new discount storesJamie Oliver is the new face of TescoCan Tesco\u0027s discounter Jack\u0027s succeed where others have failed? In terms of competing, Mr Lewis said he is not concerned about the risk of losing custom from Tesco to Jack’s: “I’d rather cannibalise myself than have somebody else cannibalise me.”As if to prove this belief, the company will open at least one Jack’s “right beside a Tesco”.In terms of competing with Aldi and Lidl, which are rapidly eating up market share in the highly competitive supermarket space, Jack’s will offer the lowest prices within the local area around each store, rather than competing on a national level. The new brand will not offer any online element, aside from an in-store app which will allow customers to scan products as they shop.The group said no jobs will be lost through the creation of Jack’s, although some staff took voluntary redundancy rather than staying on as Jack’s employees or moving to another Tesco site.The company said between 20 and 25 jobs will be created per new Jack’s store, meaning the total number of new roles created could reach 375.\u0026nbspHowever, the lower price offering will also mean lower wages for staff, Mr Lewis said, “because working conditions will be different”. Employees will be offered a base rate of pay, rather than the usual benefits package Tesco staff get. The Jack’s brand is being launched as part of the group’s centenary celebrations, and has been named in honour of Tesco founder Jack Cohen.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/10/17/arctic-monkeys-tranquility-base-hotel-and-casino.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6534776  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Arctic Monkeys – Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp; Casino  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/10/17/arctic-monkeys-tranquility-base-hotel-and-casino.jpg","title":"mercury prize 2018 shortlist arctic monkeys lily allen noel gallagher who win","story":"Created with Sketch.Winner will be announced tonight at the ceremony in LondonClick to followThe Independent CultureMercury Prize 2018 shortlist: Arctic Monkeys, Lily Allen and Noel Gallagher all up for this year\u0027s awardArctic Monkeys, Florence \u0026amp The Machine, Lily Allen, Noel Gallagher and Novelist are among the shortlisted artists on this year’s Hyundai Mercury Prize.The shortlist was picked by a panel of 12\u0026nbspexperts judges from\u0026nbspthe music industry, including broadcaster and DJ Clara Amfo, jazz musician Jamie Cullum, singers Lianne La Havas, Marcus Mumford and Ella Eyre, and music critics Will Hodgkinson (The Times) and Harriet Gibsone (deputy editor,  Guide).\u0026nbspThe shortlist was selected from over 200 albums entered for the prestigious music award, narrowed down to 12 after months of listening.

They now intend to examine the data in greater depth to learn more about the Milky Way’s history.“The discovery was easy the interpretations harder. And the full understanding of its meaning and implications might take several years,” Said Dr Amina Helmi from the University of Groningen, who also contributed to the research.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/08/07/11/maroon-5.jpg","title":"super bowl 2019 maroon 5 halftime show performer adam levine who","story":"Created with Sketch.Los Angeles based pop band to perform in AtlantaClick to followThe Independent CultureMaroon 5 formed in Los Angeles in the 1990s.

the chaos of the UK crashing out next March.But the report, written by Lord Kerr, the former diplomat who wrote the Article 50 exit notice, after discussions with constitutional and legal experts, dismisses that claim as false.Insisting recent polls showed that “people want the right to decide”, Lord Kerr said: “The die is not irrevocably cast, there is still time.“If there is a majority in parliament for a people’s vote, there are multiple routes to securing one and, as the process unfolds, more opportunities for the House of Commons to assert its will may emerge.“Should the UK need

opportunities.”Lord Kerr also repeated his insistence that the Article 50 notification could, if necessary, be revoked unilaterally to halt the Brexit process – a “cost free” option.Downing Street has been accused of suppressing legal advice that Article 50 can be withdrawn, even without Brussels’\u0026nbspagreement.The report also suggests the preferable question on the ballot paper for a fresh

crack down on people smugglers advertising their services to people in developing countries via Facebook in a bid to stem the flow of undocumented migrants to the UK at its source.The UK has identified 539 social media pages – the vast majority on Facebook – which it says are used by people illegally offering others transit to Europe.“We must now match our pursuit of people smugglers and traffickers with a renewed effort to prevent immigration crime from occurring in the first place,” Theresa May told EU leaders at a migration summit in Salzburg“To achieve this, we must tackle the enabling environment – all those factors that make it far too easy for criminal networks to emerge and grow, putting migrants’ lives at such risk.”Groups are openly advertising illegal transit services on Facebook with “travel agent” style ads, with some even offering discounts for children.The Government has tried to partly blame criminal gangs and “people smugglers” for refugees and migrants travelling to Europe.Many people are however fleeing conflict zones or economic and social turmoil and lack other means to reach Europe to claim asylum.\u0026nbspThe Government is also funding advertising and outreach campaigns in countries like Ethiopia and Sudan to convince would-be migrants that it is a bad idea to come to the UK.\u0026nbspSpeaking at the Salzburg summit the Prime Minister offered to share UK expertise on cyber-policing with other countries, stating that “online platforms have no respect for borders”.\u0026nbsp She said cooperation in this and other areas would be unaffected by Brexit. \u0026nbspThanks in part to populist governments exploiting the issue, migration is still at the top of the agenda at the EU level despite a massive fall in people

Treatment is patchy across the country and too often patients are misdiagnosed and not treated by specialists who can spot the signs.“Gambling companies have to take more responsibility for harm caused by their products and contribute more to research and treatment. We must also face up to the negative effect the explosion in gambling advertising has had.”The package follows a year-long consultation with charities, specialists in gambling addiction, gambling organisations and addicts themselves.It also comes as in-play betting becomes an increasingly prominent part of the gambling scene, with TV ads urging punters to place wagers on the next goalscorer or the final result.UK news in picturesStorm Ali has hit the British Isles bringing winds of up to 100mph.

It is our opinion that without gambling adverts there would be a lot less risk of initiating the young and the vulnerable to gambling activities by normalising a potentially harmful behaviour.”Labour meeting on deselection rule changes ends in stalemateSchools \u0027must be accountable for off-rolled pupils\u0027 exam results\u0027Labour activist claims party failing to tackle sexual harassmentOver 150 Brexit-related motions submitted ahead of Labour conferenceThe policy institute Money and Mental Health, which contributed to the review, said: “Adverts with specific offers, like free bets when registering for an online account, can lead consumers to gamble more than they intend to.“Their frequency and timing, such as late at night when people with mental health problems are vulnerable and more likely to respond, can create challenges to gambling responsibly.”Under Labour\u0027s proposals, bookmakers would still be able to offer odds on sporting events during play, but would not be allowed to advertise them for a specified period before and after games or during half-time or other breaks.A similar scheme floated in Australia would outlaw ads from five minutes before kick-off until five minutes after the final whistle.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/21/un-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/21/un-1.jpg","title":"putin erdogan syria idlib sochi russia turkey talks","story":"Created with Sketch.Gathering is second in 10 days for the Turkish and Russian leadersClick to followThe IndependentBattle for Syria\u0027s last major rebel bastion on hold as Putin and Erdogan meet to discuss next movesThe leaders of Turkey and Russia are meeting in Sochi on Monday for hastily arranged talks\u0026nbspover the fate of Syria’s last major rebel stronghold.For now the impending\u0026nbspoffensive on Idlib province, touted for weeks by Damascus and its Russian and Iranian backers, appears to be on hold as a result of Turkish diplomatic agitation and military manoeuvres.Turkey is struggling to prevent an onslaught by pro-Damascus forces on the rebel-held Idlib province, but its moves may have also escalated the potential dangers of the conflict.“We will continue our efforts with Iran and with Russia,” Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at a press conference in Islamabad late last week. “We will continue our efforts on international platforms as well.”In recent days, Turkey has begun fortifying positions in Idlib ahead of the Russian-backed Syrian government offensive. Turkey\u0026nbsphas amassed armoured vehicles, artillery guns, and tanks along the border with Syria, with some equipment moving across the frontier, according to Turkish news outlets and video footage posted to the internet.It has transferred arms and ammunition to its Free Syria Army (FSA) rebel allies, pro-Ankara newspapers reported, though some experts say the distribution of weapons won’t affect the outcome of any conflict. \u0026nbspIdlib province on 11 September in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensive (Getty)Turkey has also begun to bolster a dozen outposts it operates in and around Idlib with additional troops and military vehicles.

But Turkey’s moves have upped the geopolitical cost of any attempt to take Idlib by the pro-Assad camp that includes Russia, Iran, and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, as well as Iraqi Shia militias backed by Tehran.Around three\u0026nbspmillion Syrians live in Idlib province, a hilly agricultural region by\u0026nbspthe Turkish border. Many of the displaced have resettled in the province from other parts of the country or were forcibly relocated there from opposition enclaves recaptured by Damascus.Turkey, the primary patron of the Syrian opposition and the host to 3.5 million displaced Syrians, has vehemently opposed the regime offensive to retake Idlib. The US and Europe have urged a political solution over Idlib and warned against the military campaign. US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley repeated warnings that any use of chemical weapons by the regime would trigger a response by Washington.The UK on Saturday warned of an impending humanitarian crisis amid reports of attacks on hospitals and clinics in rebel-held territory. “The UK has been clear that a man-made catastrophe in Idlib is entirely avoidable,” Alistair Burt, Middle East minister, said in a a press release. “We support the urgent diplomatic efforts being made by Turkey and the UN.”Ankara worries in part that another bloody confrontation in Syria could flood Turkey and Europe with hundreds of thousands of fresh refugees.Airstrikes in in Idlib, northwestern SyriaAlready, thousands of displaced Syrians have relocated from the southern edges of Idlib and northern Hama province to the Turkish-controlled Afrin district adjacent to the border, said a source in Afrin. On Friday, Turkey hosted a meeting of French, German\u0026nbspand Russian officials ahead of a possible meeting of those countries’ leaders over Idlib.In addition to a possible confrontation between pro-Assad forces and Turkey, Idlib could be the flashpoint for a conflict with jihadi forces that dominate parts of the province. In recent days, al-Qaeda’s international supporters on social media have also blasted fellow jihadis in Idlib for allowing Turkey to dispatch armoured vehicles and trucks carrying tanks into Syria, as depicted in videos posted on social media.A 13 September statement signed by 15 prominent al-Qaeda supporters questioned Hayat Tahrir\u0026nbspal-Sham (HTS), the jihadi group that is a dominant player in Idlib, for granting Turkey access to the province.Mr Oliver suggested Turkey could be bolstering the observation points for fear of attacks by jihadis as well as to stymie Damascus’s offensive. “The internal problems for Idlib are huge,” he said. “We are talking about an area that has FSA factions, HTS, you have Isis\u0026nbspcells, you have other small entities.”For now Turkey’s moves have complicated plans to retake Idlib. Syrian civilians have begun to mass around the bolstered observation points in hopes that they won’t be struck by government and Russian warplanes. Thousands of Syrians who have fled the attacks of the regime and Russia are settling in the areas where the Turkish army\u0027s military posts are, because they think it is safe, the pro-government Vatan newspaper reported, publishing photos showing people purported to be sheltering near the outposts.On Friday, for the second week in a row, thousands of Syrians in the province took to the streets in peaceful, colourful demonstrations that recalled the first months of the 2011 uprising against the Assad family’s decades-long dictatorship. “For the time being, everything is postponed,” Mr Oliver said. “There is no final agreement and no final disagreement.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/15/251230075-files-this-photograph-taken-on-september-12-2017-shows-rohingya-refugees-arriving-by-boat.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/15/251230075-files-this-photograph-taken-on-september-12-2017-shows-rohingya-refugees-arriving-by-boat.jpg","title":"un myanmar rohingya genocide united nations","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentInternational Criminal Court to investigate Myanmar’s Rohingya deportationsThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has launched a preliminary investigation into the Rohingya crisis to determine whether the mass deportations of Muslims from Myanmar into Bangladesh was a crime against humanity.Chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspif the evidence collected in the initial probe was sufficient, it would pave the way for a full-blown investigation.Myanmar\u0027s military has been accused of a horrifying list of\u0026nbspviolations, including rape, murder, torture and the burning of Rohingya villages, leading about 700,000 people to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.Ms Bensouda said she will look at reports of “a number of alleged coercive acts having resulted in the forced displacement of the Rohingya people, including deprivation of fundamental rights, killing, sexual violence, enforced disappearance, destruction and looting”.Suu Kyi defends jailing of journalists who covered Rohingya killingsICC rules it can investigate crimes against RohingyaJournalists covering Rohingya crisis jailed for seven years in MyanmarAlthough Myanmar is not a member of the Hague-based court, Bangladesh is.

May demands Corbyn and Labour rule out second Brexit referendum                Raab insists Brexit date will NOT be delayed - even if no dealAny deal had to be concluded in time for an expected special EU summit pencilled in for mid-November, according to officials.This signals the fact that a very, very serious discussion is about to take place, a senior Government official said.Mrs May delivered her ultimatum as she was given the floor at an informal summit in Salzburg to address the other 27 EU leaders about her Chequers plan for a future partnership for the first time.Emphasising that time was running out, she said: We all recognise that time is short but delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option.I know that for many of you Brexit is not something you want but it\u0027s important to be clear there will be on second referendum in the UK.The public has delivered its verdict and I as Prime Minister will deliver upon that - the UK will leave on the 29th of March next year.I believe I have put forward serious and workable proposals. We will of course not agree on every detail but hopefully you will respond in kind.The onus is now on all of us to get this deal done.Theresa May said delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option (Image: \u0026bullREUTERS)Mrs May also signalled her dissatisfaction with proposals floated by EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier for simplifying the so-called Irish backstop mechanism put forward for stop-gap customs arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit.The Brussels diplomat had suggested that digital technology could be deployed to check goods being shipped between the province and the UK mainland to avoid having any new border infrastructure between the two territories.Mrs May told the EU leaders: There are two elements to tackling the unique situation in Northern Ireland.We need a sustainable relationship that enables frictionless trade - that is at the heart of our white paper.But we also remain fully committed to the December joint report including a legally operative protocol for Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement.However the commission\u0027s proposal for this protocol that I should assent to a legal separation of the UK into two customs territories is not credible.Mrs May urged the EU to come to a deal to maintain the deep economic ties between us that so many jobs on livelihoods across Europe depend.She said that Europe as a whole will be stronger and better able to cope with the threats we jointly face by keeping the UK close.Theresa May is greeted by Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz at an informal summit of EU leaders  (Image: )                Brexit: Lord Adonis \u0027lives in a world of his own\u0027 says Brexiteer                Theresa May singles out Sadiq Khan in BRUTAL second referendum tiradeMichel Barnier\u0027s team have has suggested a digital solution to the Irish border (Image: EPA)She added: We have a shared history, we have shared challenges, my desire is for a close shared future.As she arrived at the summit yesterday afternoon, the Prime Minister insisted the Brexit plan set out in a Government white paper document and agreed at her Chequers country retreat was the only credible and negotiable plan on the table that delivers no hard border in Northern Ireland and also delivers on the vote of the British people.Dismissing Mr Banier\u0027s proposals, she said: We cannot accept is seeing Northern Ireland carved away effectively from the United Kingdoms customs territory.And she also repeated her insistence that there is no chance of a second referendum being held.I want to be absolutely clear: this government will never accept a second referendum. The British people have voted to leave the European Union and we will be leaving on the 29th of March, 2019, he said.It\u0026rsquos now a matter of trust in British politicians that we should deliver on the will of the people.Theresa May pictured today before she left for the key EU summit in Salzburg (Image: )Mrs May\u0027s broadside at Brussels followed a demand from EU Council President Donald Tusk for the British proposals to be reworked.But he also appeared to offer hope of fresh EU concessions by insisting that Brussels\u0027s negotiating position had to evolve.Warning that there was less and less time to reach a deal before the UK\u0027s March 29 2019 exit date, Mr Tusk confirmed he would propose an emergency EU Brexit summit in November.The Brexit negotiations are entering the decisive phase.Various scenarios are still possible today but I would like to stress that some of Prime Minister May\u0027s proposals from Chequers indicate a positive evolution in the UK\u0027s approach, as well as the will to minimise the negative effects of Brexit.He added: On other issues such as the Irish question or the framework for economic co-operation the UK\u0027s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.Today there is perhaps more hope, but there is surely less and less time.Casting more doubt on the talks, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday claimed a Brexit deal was still far away.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, hosting yesterday\u0027s summit, raised the alarm about the damage a collapse in the Brexit talks could do to the European economy.We are convinced that we need a deal. We must do everything to avoid a hard Brexit. It would not just harm British, but would also cause damage for us in Europe, he said.We are striving to make a compromise possible. Michel Barnier is doing well, he has our full support. He has taken a step towards the British. Now we expect a willingness to compromise from the British hopefully to bring about a deal.We will propose today there is an extraordinary summit in November and if the member states support this, it will happen. Hopefully by then we will reach an agreement with Great Britain.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: I hope that we have an exit that takes place in a good atmosphere, with great respect for each other and that in certain areas very close cooperation is possible, namely in the areas of security - of domestic and also foreign security.Analysis by Macer HallFittingly, Theresa May last night made her latest pitch for an EU exit deal in a film location used for one of cinema\u0027s great escape scenes.In The Sound Of Music, the children of the Von Trapp family sing So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, good night while discreetly slipping away from Salzburg\u0027s Felsenreitschule theatre.Securing Britain\u0027s goodbye to the EU is proving to be a far more drawn-out process.In her address to EU leaders over a dinner of cream cheese and Wiener Schnitzel in Salzburg last night, she laid bare her frustrations with the glacial progress of the talks.EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier might have begun to hint at some flexibility - but British officials have yet to see any firm proposals.Mr Barnier\u0027s team have doggedly stuck to textbook EU tactics of dragging every round out to the last possible moment, and Mrs May is all too aware that Brussels will do anything possible to delay the departure process.Mrs May also suspects some EU officials are paying too much heed to the witterings about a second referendum from some quarters at Westminster.Macer Hall quizzes Prime Minister Theresa May in Downing Street (Image: Tim Clarke)Yet behind the increasingly curt exchanges about timing, officials are understood to be making progress on details.And while Mr Barnier\u0027s initial proposal is unacceptable to Britain, they are hopeful a more serious plan deploying technology to solve the Irish border conundrum is on the way.Mrs May last night confirmed she will not tolerate a long goodbye and Brussels may be about to be forced to wake up to the realisation that Britain meant what is said when it voted to leave the EU.Behind their posturing is a recognition that time is running out and the EU could face a shattering financial blow as Britain holds back much of the promised \u0026pound39billion fee.EU chiefs are desperately trying to climb down without losing face.

This noise, you couldnt avoid it.Speaking at a pre-screening he described the experience of no one recognising him from his travel shows or Monty Python.They didn’t know what a great star meant and basically to them I was a really old bloke and with their reverence for age the minder would rather delightfully would take my arm and say Are you feeling tired?In the second episode, there is a small sequence, and we were stuck in this airport and just to pass the time, our Director Neil, had brought along some footage of Monty Python and showed one minder the fish slapping dance.And her only comment at the end was, “Was that a live fish?”Palins journey begins by boarding a train from Beijing to Pyongyang - North Koreas capital.Not yet under the microscope of their full-time minders, the change in the landscape is remarkable.A shore dominated by Dandongs high-rises faces greenery and scattered buildings across the Yalu River on the North Korean side.Immediately, everything looks dferent, its as  weve stepped back inside, Palin says.His first taste of North Korean hospitality arrives in the form of a series of border guards, all intent on checking and rechecking his documentation.Palin makes it clear early on he is not going to allow an oppressive totalitarian dictatorship quash his famous sense of humour.I was asked - did I have a bible with me? I would normally say yes, absolutely, Im a good Christian man, but no, thats the wrong answer here.The second taste comes during a lunch taken on the 200-mile train journey comes with a side order of Korean propaganda as the television touts images of nuclear weapons.Off the train he meets his two guides - who turn out to actually number eight.He finds himself in a city missing many staples of the west - there are very few cars, and absolutely no adverts save for party propaganda.State controlled newspapers are covered with news of the historic meeting between north and south which were occurring at the time, and Plain says he sensed a eagerness for more openness among the populace.Palin points out how, until recently, the city would have been a soulless landscape of grey Soviet-style apartment blocks.In a simple and effective solution, Kim Jong-il commanded the whole lot was painted bright colours.Palin provides no shortage of humour titbits, including one point when he finds himself mystied watching the robotic movements of the traffic controllers - all of whom, he notes, are young women.Theres rumour that Kim Jong-un picks them himself, he says.He visits a local school and marvels at the childrens ping pong skills.Its like a factory farm for ping pong players, he says.Viewers can also look forward to the drunken antics of May Day - an annual day off for North Koreans.The celebrations allow a powerful insight into what Palin says are normal people, living in an unusual place."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000394072374.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tony blair nick clegg and john major meet with european leaders in secret plot to keep britain in the eu","story":"The two former Prime Ministers and former Deputy Prime Minister have meet with senior politicians in Europe in bid to persuade them to stop the UK leaving the European Union.They have also been working with other prominent Remainers including Peter Mandelson.The mission was begun by Mr Clegg independently but he has taken on the role of informal co-ordinator of the group,  reported.In recent weeks Clegg he met Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister and the foreign policy team of the French president, Emmanuel Macron.He has also met senior German politicians including Bundestag president Wolfgang Schäuble and Peter Altmeier, the German economics minister.Last week Blair met senior politicians in Germany and Austria and Italy’s new interior minister, Matteo Salvini as well as the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.Both have said they would be looking for Article 50 to be extended so a deal can be struck to remain in the EU that addresses concerns about immigration.“The aim of the visits is to persuade EU leaders that British politics has made the option of remaining inside the EU viable,” said Mr Clegg.“It is a question of pressing them to keep open the extension of the article 50 process beyond the March deadline to give UK negotiators more time including to prepare legislation on a people’s vote.“We cannot just turn the clock back to just before the 2016 referendum.“There would have to be some changes of freedom of movement - we cannot just put Humpty Dumpty back together again.”Mr Blair, who met Barnier on 18 July, said the main focus of his meetings was discuss a new common approach to immigration in the UK and EU.“You cannot deal with this Brexit issue unless you deal with the questions of immigration and the anxieties that gave rise to it,” he said.At a meeting on Wednesday night in Salzburg, Austria, Theresa May will have a chance to try to persuade other EU leaders to adopt her Chequers plan to for the future relationship with Brussels."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dk-graphic-page14may.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jacob rees mogg column theresa may brexit","story":"The Prime Minister will head to the continent on Thursday to visit Salzburg — like Bath, a world heritage city — to discuss her Brexit or Chequers proposals with other leaders of European governments.To date the EU has been officially dismissive of the main elements of Chequers, the complex customs arrangements and continued use of European Rules to secure access to the single market.Michel Barnier, who led the negotiations for the EU, has been clear that the EU cannot accept this position.The UK must either be in the Single Market with all that goes with it — including free movement — or it may have a free trade deal instead.In a sense, he is the keeper of the Orlamme for the EU.Historically, this was a sacred banner carried into battle for the kings of France when no prisoners were to be taken.The heads of government may be more conciliatory and keener to help a fellow leader, not least as most of them face their own domestic dficulties.It is also the usual form for the EU to make a deal.It protests that it is strictly a rules-based organisation to maximise its negotiating strength but then, like an honest costermonger, makes the necessary trade.At the same time the British Government seems desperate to agree something on almost any terms.Chequers rubbed out the Prime Minister’s red lines to leave the UK “half in, half out” subject to EU regulations in crucial areas of the economy, and to the European Court of Justice.The vassal has been put in chains.This desperation means it will be important to watch carefully what comes out of Salzburg.Any deal will be hailed initially as a triumph because of the hostile comments made not only by Mr Barnier but, in his recent state of the Union speech, by Jean-Claude Juncker.Overcoming these obstacles will be portrayed as a triumph for British diplomacy.Those who hope that Brexit will continue to mean Brexit will need to stay awake.The first item to watch out for is money. There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs. Wages are rising. Growth is strong.Now we see French companies such as Chanel stampeding to invest billions here.

And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism. But we will avoid the same fate only  the state adopts a new approach on immigration, including more political honesty, tighter border controls and an emphasis on British values.That is not racist. As the public knows, it is a recipe for greater harmony.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And Downing Street then ­produced its convoluted alternative.Except the EU, in the form of Michel Barnier, now believes in the fantasy island unicorn model too. The trouble being it wants it used between Britain and Northern Ireland instead of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.And the DUP, whom Theresa May needs for her survival, won’t wear that. Nor should they, since it ides the UK.Funny though, isn’t it, how Brussels move the goalposts when it suits them?

So we applaud Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s imaginative plan to sort the latter.The new lelong insurance system he is considering, compulsory for all workers unless they take a risk and opt out, looks a practical idea to fund part or all of an OAP’s care costs.It would give them peace of mind that they wouldn’t have to spend their savings or the proceeds from their home.Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Regardless, it is to Mr Hancock’s credit that he is starting a grown-up conversation at last over future funding of health.For too long progress has been stymied by the Left using any change to the NHS as a political weapon.But the structure of a health service designed in 1948 now needs a radical rethink.It is time reality dawned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The public has delivered its verdict, and as Prime Minister I will deliver on that. The UK will leave of 29th of March next year.”Her remarks came as:EU chiefs’ hopes of delaying or even reversing Brexit have been bolstered by Labour leaders such as London mayor Sadiq Khan giving their backing to a second referendum – dubbed a People’s Vote.Mr Tusk savaged the two most important parts of Chequers – a common rule book on goods and a new customs relationship - with a thinly veiled demand for more big concessions from the PM, and also over the Irish border.But he kept open a thin thread of hope for Mrs May by also praising some other elements of her softer Brexit blueprint.Declaring that the Brexit negotiations were entering “the decisive phase”, Mr Tusk said: “I’d like to stress that some of Prime Minister May’s proposals from Chequers indicate a positive evolution in the UK’s approach as well as a will to minimise the negative effects of Brexit.By this I mean, among other things, the readiness to cooperate closely in the area of security and foreign policy.“On other issues such as the Irish question or the framework for economic cooperation the UK’s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.”The EU boss also issued another dire warning on how time was almost up, with just six months to go until Brexit day on March 29, saying: Today there’s perhaps more hope but there’s surely less and less time.“Therefore every day that is left we must use for talks.”WHY is the EU wasting time pressing for a border between Britain and Northern ­Ireland? It’s a non-starter.No Government could consider it. Especially not one entirely reliant on the votes of those most vehemently opposed to splitting up the UK, the DUP.This cannot be news to Brussels. They cannot believe Theresa May will surrender and collapse her Government.Why persist with it? The answer must be: to run down the clock — until, at the last minute, Mrs May agrees virtually anything to avoid a No Deal.Which is why Donald Tusk also still insists key areas of our wildly over-generous Chequers offer must be “reworked”.Mrs May has gone as far as she can. Two Cabinet figures have quit already. She must insist it’s take it or leave it.Only Britain has made genuine compromises in this negotiation, as despondent Brexiteers know only too well.It’s the EU’s turn.A deal must be cracked by the end of the Autumn, he added, and confirmed a final emergency summit would be held in mid November in the hope of sealing it.And EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker also added to the pressure on Mrs May by saying that the UK and EU “are far away” from a deal still.The long-feared for rejection comes just 10 days before the Tories’ turbulent annual conference begins – plunging Mrs May into a fresh confrontation with her angry party.Hardline Brexiteer MPs and party members hate her Chequers blueprint, and even some of its supporters have insisted she must not concede any more ground to the EU.Hitting back at Mr Tusk, No10 insisted Mrs May would not budge a further inch until she hears concessions from the EU first.The PM’s official spokesman said: “What I heard from Donald Tusk is a welcoming of the evolution of the UK’s position and him setting out his plan for a special summit in November when he is hopeful a deal will be done.“What this shows you is the EU is now ready to sit down and start to have a proper discussion on a future partnership.”“The PM has evolved our position. It is now for the EU to evolve it’s position.Earlier the PM joined Ulster Unionists MPs to throw out a fresh bid by Michel Barnier to set up a new customs border down the Irish Sea.Issuing a new pledge to “improve” the EU’s offer to resolve the Irish border stand off, Brussels’ chief negotiator suggested clever technology could replace hard border post between Britain and Ulster.But on her arrival at a summit of EU leaders at Salzburg, the PM said she still cannot accept any separation of the province from the rest of the UK.The DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds also angrily shot down the Barnier plan, saying: “It still means a border down the Irish Sea”.But Mr Dodds also dubbed it “progress of sorts” that Brussels is now ready to look at technological solutions, having already dismissed it a solution for the Ireland’s North-South border as “magical thinking”.At the leaders’ dinner last night, Mrs May also warned them that there will be no Brexit deal unless their “unacceptable” Irish Sea border demands are dumped.British diplomats hoped for warmer words from EU leaders over Chequers, at least until after the Tory conference in Birmingham.Earlier yesterday, former Brexit Secretary David Davis warned the PM she would fail to keep Chequers on the table, as EU leaders will pile ever more demands for more concessions from.Instead, Mrs May will be forced to “reset” and “step back to what Donald Tusk offered in March” - a Canada-style free trade agreement, Mr Davis argued.Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4s Today programme: All these things will come back and well see more and more pressure, and she will have a deal she wont be able to bring back to the House of Commons because itll be lumbered with loads of other EU demands.“So shes going to have to have something else.The ex-Cabinet minister, who resigned in protest over the Chequers plan in July, also said he had repeatedly told Mrs May there would be a pressure point late in negotiations.Mr Davis added: It’s always the case with the European Union that they move at the last possible minute - after theyve tested your mettle, after theyve taken you to the clf edge, and thats what will happen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And they’re right to be.As recently as 1991, a third of those aged 16 to 24 owned their own home.Now, that figure is ten per cent.For those aged 25 to 34, the rate has fallen from 66 per cent to 38 per cent.Home ownership rates in Britain are now the fourth lowest in the EU, and we have the second highest proportion of social housing, i.e., people living in homes provided by the State.Earlier this year, we at the Centre for Policy Studies commissioned polling asking young people how government could make their lives better.The top answer was clear — they want housing to be more affordable.And not via cheaper rents — by a three-to-one margin, they wanted the Government to prioritise home ownership.Strikingly, only three per cent of those aged 18 to 24 told us they never wanted to own their own home.They just can’t see themselves being able to afford it for years — often decades.This is a crisis with many causes.The persistent failure, stretching back decades, to build enough new homes. A dysal planning system.Existing homeowners who don’t want their communities disrupted or their views spoiled.A Labour government that made it much easier for buy-to-let landlords to snap up those homes that were being built, and much harder for first-time buyers to do the same — and a financial crash which made that problem so much worse. Yet it’s also a crisis with many solutions.Making it easier to extend or expand existing properties. Changing Green Belt regulations so we protect our most beautul countryside while building on pig farms, or beside railway stations or motorways or electricity substations or other decidedly non-green and unpleasant bits of land.Finding ways  to turn renters into owners, as Margaret Thatcher did with the Right to Buy for council tenants in the 1980s, with more than a little success.But the sad truth is that while the Government has succeeded in dragging up construction levels, it is still not thinking anywhere near radically enough.“Since my very first day in Downing Street, I have made it my personal mission to fix our broken housing system,” Theresa May told the National Housing Federation yesterday.But that mission is in grave jeopardy.A year ago, the Prime Minister endured a triple whammy of embarrassment in her party conference speech — being handed a P45 by a prankster, developing a crippling cough, then seeing the slogan behind her start to fall off.Mrs May bravely endured these trials. But she could do little about the fact that her promise in the same speech to “make the British dream a reality by igniting home ownership once again” was built around a £10billion expansion of the Help to Buy scheme.A scheme which pretty much every economist, including the Government’s own Office for Budget Responsibility, says is mostly serving to push up house prices and make colossally rich housebuilders even richer.Indeed, even as Mrs May was speaking, their collective share price spiked by £1BILLION.Yesterday, the Prime Minister ed to the subject.In a speech to the National Housing Summit, she promised another £2billion for social housing.But even on its own terms, Mrs May’s proposal isn’t a blunderbuss.It’s a pinprick. Not only is the £2billion spread over a decade but it’s a small fraction of the amount that George Osborne cut from the same budgets.And it fits a wider pattern. For all the Government’s rhetoric, the big ideas to get Britain building just aren’t there.One of the keys to David Cameron’s election victory in 2015 — right there on the first page of the Tory manesto — was a promise to extend the Right to Buy to housing associations and to build 200,000 starter homes.The commitment was to create two million more homeowners within five years.As of May 2018, not a single one of those starter homes had been built — and the expansion of Right to Buy is still lodged in the gullet of the Whitehall machine.It’s the same pattern on planning reform.Sajid Javid’s robust proposals as Communities Secretary to break up the oligopoly of the big housebuilders, free up more land and speed up development — all badly needed — were neutered by Downing Street, because it was paranoid about upsetting traditional Tory voters who don’t like the sight of bulldozers.When the Government’s new planning framework was announced in March, the headlines were about building more and higher-quality homes.But the small print made it so that councils could get away with building fewer houses, not more.I don’t doubt that Mrs May’s heart is in the right place.But  she and her team don’t pluck up their courage on housing — and take far more dramatic steps both to build more houses and create more homeowners — they’ll almost certainly lose the next election. More than that, they’ll deserve to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vexed issue. Complain about it and people will call you a racist.That’s a popular way of shutting down debate these days. Just screech “raaacisst” at someone.I’d go so far as to say it’s one of the reasons Leave won the referendum — because ordinary people were sick of being called racist when they simply worried about the millions of people who have arrived here in the past ten years.About seven million, in fact. An astonishing number.The Prime Minister is about to draw up her plans for immigration post-Brexit.She will be taking advice from the Migration Advisory Committee . It has suggested we allow in skilled workers who might be vital to our economy.It has also suggested we clamp down on low-skilled migrants.This seems to me a perfectly sensible argument. We should not entirely close ourselves off from the world. And there are foreign nationals here who do excellent work for our country. And pay good taxes.At the same time, the vast influx of low-skilled workers has had a terrible effect upon our country.Some towns — such as Boston in Lincolnshire — have been effectively taken over.And as the MAC found, the vast reservoir of labour has depressed the wages of British people at the lowest end of the scale. It has hurt the poorest of us.But it doesn’t only hurt us. You’ll have seen the squalid conditions in which a lot of these low-paid foreign workers live. This is exploitation, on a massive scale.How any leftie can support it absolutely befoggles me.Living below the minimum wage, crammed into rotten accommodation — all so companies such as Amazon can make a bigger profit.No wonder the big companies were the first to complain. Listen: Pay your workers a decent, living wage in future and shut up, huh?But this is an overcrowded country. It is ludicrous to suggest that the millions we have allowed in have not had a massive effect on our infrastructure.It’s why we need to pave over more and more of the countryside to build homes, for example. The MAC suggested house prices had risen as a consequence — and our homes already cost too much.There’s pressure on our schools, our hospitals and our transport networks.Well, with any luck this will all come to an end. Perhaps the Government might also abide by its pledge to get yearly immigration levels down to the tens of thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands as it is at the moment.But at the same time we should look after the EU migrants we have already let in, and ensure they feel secure and safe living in Britain.Do all that and I’ll be a happy man.

Making improvements in response to courier feedback is a top priority, such as the sickness, injury, maternity and paternity protections we recently introduced.Our door is always open for inidual couriers to speak to us about any issues theyre having.A McDonalds spokeswoman directed the Sun Online to Uber for comment on the protests, but added nothing on delivery impact had been flagged specically to them through their customer services channels.Couriers went on strike in Scotland earlier this month in protest over the planned wage change.And in 2016 and 2017 drivers and couriers demonstrated against pay cuts."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000284792579.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"high speed hose treat prostate","story":"It shoots a saline solution guided by a robot into the prostate in minutes rather than the patient having to spend a night in hospital.Millions of older men commonly struggle with a condition known as benign prostate hypertrophy — causing problems with urinating.The prostate gland becomes enlarged and presses on the tube that takes urine from the bladder.The speedy new hose treatment could bring relief to many sufferers.Guidance published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said: “This procedure uses a specialised system for the targeted heat-free removal of prostate tissue with the patient under general or spinal anaesthesia. “A probe is inserted through the urethra and into the bladder where its position is confirmed using a computer.”It added: “The old procedure normally involved an overnight stay in hospital.”Clinical trials for the “hosepipe” are still on-going and more evidence will be available about the treatment next year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are urging you to get yours serviced and to install audible carbon monoxide monitors in your home.It might just save a le.Schoolgirl Katie Overton went to bed excited about her little sister’s birthday party next day — but tragically the family never got to celebrate.The next morning, the 11-year-old was found dead in her bed, having been poisoned by carbon monoxide which had leaked from a faulty boiler at her home.Stepdad Paul recalls: “We’d been busy getting ready for Emma’s fth birthday party. We’d been baking cakes and blowing up balloons.“We went to bed as normal that night. In the morning we all got up and cracked on with the arrangements and we thought Katie was having a lie-in.“The house seemed very quiet. I popped out and when I came home, Katie still wasn’t up.“We were used to her having a lie-in at the weekend, but we felt something was wrong.”Mum Debra, 47, went up to Katie’s bedroom at the family’s rented terraced house in Southsea, Hants.Paul, 53, recalls: “Debs called out to me that she’d been sick in her bed. I ran upstairs and she was lying there, motionless.“I started shaking her, trying to rouse her. She wasn’t responding. Her body was cold.“I told Debs to call 999 and I spoke to paramedics on the phone. They told me to try mouth-to-mouth, but her jaw was locked. I knew then she was dead.“We had no idea why or what had happened. All of us were in a state of shock.”An ambulance rushed Katie to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, but within half an hour a doctor confirmed the family’s worst fears.Paul says: “He said there was nothing they could do for her. There was no obvious cause of death.“All we could think was that she’d been sick in her sleep and choked on it.“Because it was an unexplained death, we had CID come to the house. They asked us all sorts of questions, whether Katie had been having any problems at school.“They took away the mattress as evidence and the four of us were left in the house, with no idea the gas was still leaking.”To make matters even worse, rumours circulated around the area that Paul and Debra had murdered their daughter.Paul says: “A friend of Debra’s told us there were some lies going around. There was a lot of stares and whispering behind our backs.“It was incredibly hard to deal with, as we were grieving for Katie.“We were in a state of shock. She was a perfectly healthy girl and she seemed fine when she went to bed the night before.”Post-mortems do not routinely check for carbon monoxide poisoning, so no cause of death was given to her family.But around ten days later, Debra woke Paul early one morning complaining of a strong smell of fumes.He recalls: “I had a splitting headache and the house stank. I felt dizzy and sick.“I phoned our letting agent and said we thought something was seriously wrong with the boiler. An engineer came out and said he was going to put a carbon monoxide monitor by the boiler and we all had to leave the house. He left it running for ten minutes before going back in to grab it. He ran back out again and said, ‘I can’t believe any of you are alive.’“There was a lethal amount of carbon monoxide in the house. He kept saying he was surprised we were still alive.“I asked him  he thought it might have caused Katie’s death and he said, ‘Possibly’.” Paul phoned the police and even though Katie’s body had been cremated, they still had some blood samples. They later tested positive for carbon monoxide.An investigation revealed that faulty pipework on the boiler had been allowing the toxic gas to escape into Katie’s bedroom. Paul has been campaigning for tighter regulations to prevent deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning ever since Katie’s death in March 2003.She says: “He seemed very poorly. He didn’t have a temperature but he kept falling asleep and he’d vomit.“Then, I’d find him asleep in the dining room in a really strange position. Something just didn’t feel right.”The same morning, the carbon monoxide alarm at her home in Strood, Kent, started beeping. She says: “It wasn’t the continuous warning alarm but it was beeping as  it had run out of batteries.“I guess it just made me think and I had a niggling feeling it might be something to do with carbon monoxide. I rushed Aaden-James to A\u0026ampE. They took a blood sample and within five minutes he was on oxygen. He had to spend a couple of days in hospital.“Fortunately, he is OK and there are no lasting effects.”Tests later revealed the gas was leaking from pipes at the top of the boiler.Kirstein says: “If you don’t have a carbon monoxide alarm, get one now. I had one before, now I have three.”But latest figures show there are still around 50 fatalities a year in the UK.He says: “Fteen years on and the basic laws haven’t changed and people are still dying.“Katie’s death was preventable. We didn’t have a carbon monoxide alarm in the house.“We are all now living with a sadness that will never go away.”Paul adds that the tragedy has been particularly hard on Katie’s sisters, Sian, now 22, and Emma, 21.He says: “We want to make people aware of the dangers of carbon monoxide so no more families lose someone like we have.“Sometimes people will say to me, ‘It’s OK, I haven’t got gas, I’ve got a wood-burning stove.’“But carbon monoxide is produced by all solid fuels that burn. There are more carbon monoxide alarms around now than when Katie died, but in England, the law says they only have to be in properties that burn solid fuel.THE Sun is offering you the chance to win one of five brand new Ariston boilers worth more than £1,000 each.The Ariston Clas Net ONE comes with an industry-leading 12-year warranty.To be in with a chance of winning see thesun/aristoncompetition and answer two simple questions.“In Scotland, they have to be in all properties. The law in England needs changing — everyone should have one.“What about older properties? They often don’t have alarms. And what about your neighbour? We lived in a terraced house — the people next door may well have been poisoned as well.“Carbon monoxide goes straight through the brickwork. Please make sure you install an audible alarm in your home. If we’d had one, we would have been alerted to the gas and our beautul Katie would still be with us.”Paul also warns that gas safety ­certicates are not a substitute for ­having appliances regularly serviced.He says: “You can get a certicate without having a service. Of course, a lot of people choose this asSue, 45, had moved into a new-build home in Sale, Grt Manchester, with son Josh and now ex-husband Paul in 2003.She says: “I worked at home running a building firm. I’d get headaches and be queasy, dizzy and fatigued. I put it down to stress. I was forgetful, but thought I was getting dementia. Josh was six. He’d get stomach and head pains.Three years later, Sue was admitted to hospital TWICE with chest pain – and once collapsed – but each time doctors misdiagnosed cocaine abuse, let her rest then discharged her.“No one mentioned carbon monoxide and I wasn’t tested,” she says. But the warranty on her boiler then expired and Paul called an engineer, who found the leaky flue under the lounge floor.Sue still suffers memory, migraine and rheumatic trouble while Josh has poor concentration, and she thinks her family only survived because Paul would open windows a lot. She warns: “With smoke you get a warning but with CO there is no taste or smell. It is a silent killer.”“But what it means is that all these years after Katie’s death, an engineer can walk into a house, have a look at the flame and say, ‘Yes it’s burning a nice blue and it is safe.’“It gives you a false confidence. All gas appliances need to be serviced as per the manufacturers’ guidelines.“And get it done now, don’t wait until November when engineers are busy.

The electorate has clearly spoken.I would like to thank my true friends, family, the electorate who have stood by me with unwavering support.

He should demonstrate some humility.Mr Paisleys Commons ban has left Theresa May shorn of one of her 10 DUP MP confidence and supply allies during a period that could witness several crucial Brexit votes.An investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found the cost of the hospitality afforded Mr Paisley and his family may have been signicantly more than his £50,000 estimate.It found the Sri Lankan holidays included business-class air travel, accommodation at first-class hotels, helicopter trips and visits to tourist attractions for the North Antrim MP and his wider family.The trips also included meeting with Sri Lankan governmental figures.Mr Paisleys threshold for registering such hospitality in 2013 was around £660."},{"url":null,"title":"van driver soaks schoolboy driving through puddle storm ali","story":"The clip - filmed yesterday as deadly Storm Ali caused chaos in the UK - was posted on Twitter with the caption: Get back to class ya wet wipe”. It shows the driver pulling out at a junction before driving straight towards a large brown puddle at the side of the road.He then speeds up after seeing three young boys with backpacks on just inches from the puddle.One, who appears to be aged around 15, can be seen trying to shield himself as the water completely drenches him.The Ford driver then laughs before the video - believed to be filmed in Edinburgh - cuts out. The clip was uploaded by @pammy_caton to Twitter yesterday afternoon where it has since attracted over 162,000 views.The 22-year-old electrician has since received dozens of messages trolling him - although at no point does he admit being behind the wheel.One Twitter user, @staceyjaxx451, wrote: “Thats real clever…”@stevieberwick said: “What a c***y thing to do.

Will it be discussed?Absolutely. To some extent the summit has morphed into a key Brexit staging post.There won\u0027t be any formal conclusions or formal changes to the position of the EU - this is an informal summit and the rigidity of EU processes mean they cannot suddenly change course.But there could be subtle indicators of positions being moulded.:: Any key moments to look out for?Yes - at the leaders dinner Theresa May had 10 minutes to state the UK position.It\u0027s the first time that the leaders have all met as one since Britain\u0027s Chequers proposal  was revealed back in July. She eyeballed her colleagues with a detailed explanation of what that means.She is understood to have told them that neither side can demand the unacceptable of the other and she told them that there would be no second referendum in the UK and no delay to the UK\u0027s departure. Towards the end of the summit the 27 remaining members of the EU will meet without Mrs May to discuss Brexit.After that President Tusk and Mrs May will have a 10 minute meeting.There she will hear, in private, what the 27 think, collectively, of her position. Immediately afterwards she will give a news conference.:: Are the two sides really worried about there being a \u0027no-deal\u0027 clf-edge withdrawal?Yes. President Tusk made that very clear in his letter to EU leaders: \"Unfortunately, a no deal scenario is still quite possible. But  we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe.\"In my sideline chats, EU and UK diplomats are even more blunt. A \"no-deal\" by accident is unnecessarily possible - each blames the other\u0027s intransigence.At the main summit - the remaining 27 EU leaders will meet without Mrs May but with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier to discuss what they call the \"state of play\" of the negotiations.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"It prompted the resignation of then Brexit secretary David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson, both of whom thought the proposal did not deliver the Brexit people voted for.And the EU side has consistently said Chequers isn\u0027t workable because it ides the integrity of the EU\u0027s single market by \"cherry picking\" the favourable parts of it.:: What\u0027s holding things up?There are two singular and distinct problems holding up the Brexit process.The first is part of the orce deal - the actual process of Brexit - and it\u0027s the \"Irish backstop\" problem.Britain has committed to leaving the single market and the customs union.By definition that means checks need to take place at hard borders between the UK and the EU unless or until some sort of mutual trade deal can be established. It is known as the \"backstop\" because it is a fallback position that the EU insists must be \"legally operable\" in case no better arrangement in the form of a trade deal  materialises.But it is a problem on the island of Ireland where no one wants to see the a  of hard borders between the north and the south.The EU\u0027s answer is for Northern Ireland to remain in the EU customs union. They say that checks can take place as goods pass between the British mainland and Northern Ireland and point out some agricultural checks already take place.The UK says that is not possible because putting Northern Ireland in a separate customs zone breaks up the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The second problem relates to the framework for the future relationship. This needs to be ironed out and put in a formal text - a political declaration - as part of the Brexit process.However the British Chequers proposal for the future relationship does not fly with the EU side.They think it represents a partial customs union on goods but no customs union on services and no freedom of movement.That, for Brussels, is cherry picking and undermines the integrity of the EU - other countries will want the same they fear and the whole single market/customs union project falls apart.It is quite easy to find compromise on the political declaration or to fudge it and deal with it later, post-Brexit day. It\u0027s much harder with the Irish backstop which is more binary and immediate.:: How\u0027s the relationship between the two sides?Not great. The British perception that the EU side isn\u0027t budging despite signicant compromises on their part is a source of huge frustration.The EU is angered by suggestions in the UK, by the Brexit secretary and prime minister no less, that they won\u0027t pay the \"exit bill\"   there is no deal.The EU was alarmed by Michael Gove\u0027s suggestion that whatever deal is done on the future framework, it can always be unravelled after Brexit day. ."},{"url":null,"title":"never miss update things you","story":"NewsNever miss an update on the things you care about - sign up for newsletters from the MirrorGet updates straight to your inbox - whether you like Politics, football, showbiz gossip, travel or want to know the latest breaking newsShare\u0026nbspByNicola OakleyHead of Audience16:17, 22 AUG 2018Updated14:44, 7 SEP 2018NewsOn the go?

EU chief Donald Tusk slapped down the Prime Minister’s blueprint as leaders arrived for a crunch showdown in Salzburg. But, over dinner in the Austrian city, Mrs May indicated the UK would walk away  EU bosses fail to support her Chequers proposal by mid-November. She said: “We all recognise that time is short but delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option. “I know that for many of you Brexit is not something you want but it’s important to be clear that there will be no second referendum in the UK.  “The public has delivered its verdict and I as Prime Minister will deliver upon that. “The UK will leave on March 29 next year.” The PM also warned EU leaders not to split the UK as a solution to customs arrangements on Northern Ireland\u0027s border with the Republic, which forms the UK\u0027s only land frontier with the EU. She said: “The Commission\u0027s proposal for this protocol – that I should assent to a legal separation of the United Kingdom into two customs territories - is not credible.” Brexiteers and Remainers have blasted her proposal, known as the Chequers plan because it was agreed at the PM’s country retreat. But, speaking over a slap-up meal of cream cheese with a tomato and courgette salad, followed by Viennese schnitzel with parsley potatoes, she insisted: “I believe I have put forward serious and workable proposals. “We will of course not agree on every detail but I hope that you will respond in kind. “The onus is now on all of us to get this deal done.”  Earlier, EU Council President Donald Tusk dealt the latest hammer blow to the PM’s favoured withdrawal plan. Hours before her RAF jet even landed in the Austrian Alps, where the Sound of Music was set, he welcomed a “positive evolution” in Britain’s position, “as well as the will to minimise the negative effects of Brexit”. But he added: “On other issues, such as the Irish question or the framework for economic cooperation, the UK’s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.” Revealing plans for an emergency EU Brexit summit in November, Mr Tusk warned: “Today there is perhaps more hope but there is surely less less and time.” EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker claimed the EU and Uk were “far away”.

The government today launched the biggest review of the railways since privatisation after a scathing watchdog verdict on disruption on Thameslink and Northern Rail. But asked by the BBC  he would consider his position Mr Grayling said: My job, my position, is to get this sorted. Instead he blamed fragmented decision making and said: I’m not going to point the finger at iniduals. It\u0027s a system problem, it\u0027s the way the whole industry works, that\u0027s what the review says. Mr Grayling has spent six years in the Cabinet, one of the longest-serving current ministers round the table, despite being infamous for his failed policies.   He held the Justice Secretary job for less than three years yet his prisoner book ban, court fees and a training deal with Saudi Arabia have all been ditched.   A \u0026pound23m prisoner tracking scheme he unveiled was also axed, while the Court of Appeal slammed another legal aid cut that forced domestic violence victims to show evidence to get a lawyer.  The Office of Rail and Road  today published its report into what went wrong with the biggest rail timetable change in a generation, which was introduced in May. It blamed rail industry “failures” for the chaos which caused misery for passengers, but also said Mr Grayling\u0027s Department for Transport  was aware of the risks and its slow response aggravated the challenge of rewriting the timetable. The report added: Had the final decision by DfT to phase the introduction of services been aligned with the schedule for developing the timetable in August 2017, the unpredicted consequences for the Thameslink timetable may have been avoided and the consequential risks of a timetabling failure on the scale experienced would have been greatly reduced.  Mr Grayling also refused today to heed Labour\u0027s calls for rail nationalisation. He claimed that since privatisation the railways have enjoyed unprecedented growth and success and we’re now a victim of that success. The Tory minister told Sky News: I’m very much a believer in public-private partnership… it’s not that state ownership is a panacea. However, he added: I think now the structure that was created 25 years ago in which you have fragmentation of track and train in dferent parts of the industry is no longer delivering for passengers. Train operators, Network Rail and the Department for Transport and even ORR itself were all criticised for making mistakes in the hard-hitting report, which came nearly two months after Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told MPs: ”I don’t run the railways.” The hapless cabinet minister dubbed ‘failing’ Grayling shunted blame for the rail timetable chaos into the sidings when he appeared before the all-party Commons Transport Select Committtee. Today - in the wake of the report - Mr Grayling announced a wide-ranging review into the running of the railways, which came under fire from Labour and rail union leaders. It will be led by Keith Williams - deputy chairman of John Lewis and former chief executive of British Airways - who will be supported by an external panel. But Andy McDonald, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary, said: “Rail passengers don’t need another review from the Tories to tell them that rail is broken. Another review is meaningless in a year of rocketing fares, failing franchises and timetabling chaos. “Another review lets Chris Grayling off the hook. The railways need a Labour government which will deliver public ownership of rail.” And Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said: ”The announcement of yet another so-called ‘independent’ review of a system that is broken beyond repair is a total distraction.  “The railways should be publicly owned, safe, secure and accessible for all and not a vehicle simply for private greed.” He branded the ORR report a “whitewash” that ignored the “dire consequences of nearly twenty five years of privatisation, fragmentation and exploitation on Britain’s railways.” In the timetable chaos passengers on Northern and Thameslink networks were particularly badly hit, leaving tens of thousands stranded by reduced or cancelled services. The ORR report says that during the planning stages the industry placed engineering and planning concerns ahead of serving its passengers, and that was made worse by the poor information train operators provided when disruption happened. It states that a key issue was an apparent gap in industry responsibility and accountability for managing systemic risks, and adds”that needs to change.” Professor Stephen Glaister, inquiry chairman, said:“The May 2018 timetable was meant to offer more services and reliability, but in reality it led to major disruption for passengers. “Central to the issues were that good intentions and over-optimism within the rail industry about its ability to recover missed deadlines left no time to uncover and fix problems.

The human smuggling gangs peddle their services like travel agents across social media, with 539 pages referred to Europol by British police last year. One page even offered discounts for children. The Prime Minister urged EU leaders to confront social media sites hosting the sick ads over dinner in Salzburg. She said tonight: “We must tackle the enabling environment – all those factors that make it far too easy for \u0026shycriminal networks to emerge and grow, putting migrants’ lives at such risk.”  The ads paint a picture of safe, comfortable travel to the EU. But, in reality, refugees and economic migrants clamber aboard ramshackle wooden and inflatable boats, packed tightly together for the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean from the North African coast. Most have no lejackets and last year an estimated 3,500 migrants drowned attempting the crossing. About 1,000 victims had perished by June this year trying to reach the EU. A senior UK official said of the social media posts: “They are appearing in a form that we would consider adverts and are clearly designed to make the idea of being smuggled into Europe an attractive and largely risk-free choice, which clearly it is not. “That is why we want these things removing as soon as possible.” While some other social media sites also hosted ads for trafficking, the official added: “In the majority of cases we are aware of it has involved Facebook.”  The attack by the PM is the latest blow to Facebook, which has previously been accused of taking too long to take down child abuse images, far-right content and terrorist videos. The tech giant has also faced claims of tax avoidance for switching revenues between dferent countries which, experts said, could be done to minimise tax payments. It denies avoiding tax and insists it pays all money due. But in 2014, it forked out just \u0026pound4,327 in Britain, and in 2016 it coughed up \u0026pound5.1million on sales of \u0026pound842million and \u0026pound58million profit. Earlier, EU Council President Donald Tusk hailed a fall in the number of illegal migrants making their way to Europe. Numbers dropped from two million in 2015 to fewer than 100,000 this year.

The party also plans to ban the use of credit cards to place bets which will slash billions of pounds of transactions a year. The pledges come as part of a radical crackdown on the gambling industry designed to tackle an “epidemic” of addiction. Branding problem gambling “a public health emergency”, Deputy Labour Leader Tom Watson said that Labour’s next manesto will also boost NHS resources for research into and treatment of gambling addiction, funded in part from a compulsory 1% levy on operators’ gross gambling yield. Labour will also bring in new rules enabling addicts to tell their banks to block online gambling transactions.  He also repeated Labour’s call for Premier League football clubs to end sponsorship deals with gambling firms, and pledged legislation  they do not act voluntarily. In-play betting has become an increasingly prominent part of the gambling scene in recent years, with TV ads in the run-up to games and during half-time urging punters to place wagers on the next goalscorer or the final result. Labour’s review uncovered concerns that, with instant online betting now widely available via smartphones, the ads may present a risk to gambling addicts, young people and those with mental health problems. Research by Goldsmiths University’s Professor Rachel Cassidy estimated that gambling advertising increased six-fold between 2007 and 2013. And recent analysis found that 17% of all adverts during the football World Cup in Russia were for gambling. Mr Watson said: “Problem gambling is Britain’s hidden epidemic and we must treat it as a public health emergency.

In a keynote speech today, Theresa May boasted that tackling Britain’s housing crisis is her “personal mission” in a keynote speech. The PM also claimed that her government has committed billions of pounds to getting more homes built. But shocking statistics buried in an official Government report reveal how the Tories have dramatically cut the amount of new cheaper housing rented out to poverty-stricken Brits. Independent housing experts said our findings exposed a “huge drop” in available social housing.  Labour Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey said the figures proved the Tories have made the housing crisis “worse” not better. When the Tories came to power in 2010, there were 270,000 new homes a year rented out by councils or housing associations to Brits on lower incomes. The following year, in 2011/12, this was cut by 3,000. In 2012/13 the 2010/11 total new homes was slashed by 36,000. Every year since 2010 there have been further cuts to the number of social houses let, according to the report by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. By 2016/17, there were 70,000 fewer new social rent homes available compared to 2010. In total, there have been 213,501 fewer cheaper houses since the Tories came to power.

But speaking to the BBC just before the dinner, Mr Muscat said: “There is a unanimous – or almost unanimous, I would say – point of view around the table that we would like the almost impossible to happen, that the UK has another referendum.  “That being said, I don\u0027t know what the result would be, whether it would be any dferent from the first result. “I think most of us would welcome a situation where there is the possibility of the British people putting things into perspective, seeing what has been negotiated, seeing the options and then deciding once and for all.” Mr Babis claimed a fresh vote would “solve the problem” of Brexit. He told the BBC: “I\u0027m very unhappy that UK is leaving so it might be better maybe to make another referendum and maybe the people could change their view.” The comments were seized on today by campaigners who want a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s deal with Brussels - a so-called \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027.  Despite Brexit formally happening in fewer than 200 days, Eloise Todd, chief executive of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: There is still time for the UK to check with the people  Brexit is what they still want. Even EU leaders are now saying they would accommodate that  we wanted. It comes as EU leaders met last night and today to thrash out their response to Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan, drawn up at her country retreat Chequers. Mrs May was meeting Irish leader Leo Varadkar this morning before talks with EU Council President Donald Tusk to wrap up the informal summit in Salzburg. She was then due to hold a press conference in the Austrian city this afternoon. The summit in Salzburg is the first of three crucial meetings with the other 27 EU leaders. If they reach agreement on a Brexit deal, it will then have to pass a vote in the UK House of Commons - where Labour and scores of Tories are threatening to reject it. The UK\u0027s current Brexit plan is based on a deal Theresa May drew up at Chequers, her country retreat, in July 2018. At the time it was seen as a major sht to soft Brexit - prompting hard-Leaver Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign. The \u0027Facilitated Customs Arrangement\u0027 is a bid to solve the biggest problem of Brexit - how to stop a hard border between Northern Ireland and either the EU, or the rest of the UK. It would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. Under this plan, the UK would share a common rulebook with Brussels for goods, including agricultural and food products. Britain would also collect some, but not all, customs tarfs on the EU\u0027s behalf. Parliament would technically keep the right to block future rules. But Tory Brexiteers said this olive branch would useless in practice. They forced Theresa May to amend the plan to say the EU should collects tarfs on the UK\u0027s behalf. Mrs May insisted this didn\u0027t scupper her plan. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier disagreed, and has continued to suggest there will be a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Remainers and Labour have also opposed the Chequers plan, saying it leaves Britain half-in-half-out of the EU in the worst of all worlds.  With a November deadline to agree a deal with the EU looming, and the plan facing a vote in Parliament after that, the UK is now ramping up plans to leave in March 2019 with no deal. Last night Mrs May shot down calls for a second referendum, telling EU leaders: Delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option. “I know that for many of you Brexit is not something you want but it’s important to be clear that there will be no second referendum in the UK. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker described Theresa May\u0027s presentation to EU leaders in Salzburg as interesting. It was polite, it was not aggressive, she was doing her job, he told reporters as he arrived for a second day of talks.

Mum-of-four Nikki O\u0027Neill, 46, from Bournemouth, says she became addicted to the low-fat snacks - which were previously \u0027free\u0027 to eat on the diet plan - as they satisfied her sweet tooth. She munches her way through six or eight yogurts daily, but says on a bad day she can consume three or four multipacks. Slimming World announced on Monday that Muller Lights now have to be counted as 1 \u0027Syn\u0027 each, within a member\u0027s daily allowance of between five and 15.  If Nikki continued to eat her way through multipacks, she would now far exceed her maximum Syn allowance before counting any other treats. A plain vanilla Muller Light contains 99 calories per pot, meaning 24 would add up to an intake of 2376 calories in yogurts alone. Despite her addiction, Nikki, who works in a school as a kitchen assistant, has managed to lose a huge amount of weight on the plan.  She told : I\u0027m devastated by the news. I\u0027ve been doing Slimming World for five and a half months and I\u0027ve lost almost three stone. I never liked yogurts until I joined. I have a sweet tooth so I soon realised that this would be a great replacement for sugary snacks. Most people on Slimming World might have one or two low fat yogurts a day, but Nikki confesses she eats between six and eight Muller Lights daily. On a bad day I could easily get through three or four six-packs, she said. That adds up to between 18 and 24 yogurts in as many hours.  Nikki explained: I would usually have two for breakfast mixed in with oats, then a couple for lunch and dinner. The rest are in between meals - probably every half an hour when I am home in between my jobs. I have the fruit flavours in the morning and during the day. Then in the evening I love the orange or caramel ones with added chocolate bits. I\u0027m gutted, though, as they have just brought out banoffee flavour and I would have lived off these!  Nikki estimates she spends upwards of \u0026pound30 per week on the light desserts - and she panics  she doesn\u0027t have any in the fridge. Every night, pretty much, my husband will ask  we need anything from the shops and yogurts are always on the list, she said. The school worker is mum to Luke, nine, Holly, 10, Jack, 13 and 28-year-old Liam and says she is renowned for her addiction among her friends and family - who think it\u0027s hilarious. I was gutted when I heard they were to have Syns but I also found it so funny that friends and family tagged me in posts about it, she said.  I genuinely worry what I will have as my go-to sweet snack now. It\u0027s going to be a really hard habit to break, that\u0027s for sure. I will have to savour each one instead of having four or five in a row! When asked  she\u0027s tempted to carry on eating the yogurts excessively, given how much weight she\u0027s lost, Nikki had a logical answer. To be honest,  I cut down to, say, six a day, that will probably make a big dference to my weight loss. A Slimming World spokesperson said: “We routinely review our guidance for all food products to ensure it includes the most up to date information and advice, and incorporates feedback from our members and Consultants.

Researchers say they have now narrowed a decades-long search for the Endeavour to one or two archaeological sites. The Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project  however have warned they are yet to “definitively” confirm whether the wreck has been located. The director of the Australian National Maritime Museum, Kevin Sumption, described their findings as promising. He said ers in the US were currently working to confirm whether one of five shipwrecks is the Endeavour by gathering samples from the location. “It’s not definitive that this is Endeavour,” he said. “We’re carefully gathering very specic samples of timber and we’re going to conduct forensic analysis to see what we have. Most of the ships that were scuttled in Newport in August 1778 were built of American or Indian timbers [but] the Endeavour was built in the north of England of predominantly oak.  “With some good detective work we can sample the timbers of this promising site [and] then we might have evidence that this ship is at least British in origin.” The discovery has stirred hope that the remains could be excavated in time for the planned celebrations in 2020 of the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook’s arrival in Australia. More details of the ship are set to be released on Friday with researchers saying they will provide a three-dimensional image of the site located off tiny Goat Island in Narragansett Bay in Newport. The scientists have cautioned that time has taken a considerable toll on the remains. The ship, one of the most famous in naval history, was used by Captain Cook on his first voyage of discovery to Australia from 1769 to 1771.

Emma, 38, says she wants her son to enjoy days of \u0027fun and freedom\u0027 and \u0027playing in the wild\u0027, Hull Live reports . Stanley is a June baby and so is one of the youngest in the school year. He does not have any additional needs, but his parents believe it is in his best interests to start school next year, once he is five and at compulsory school age .  In her blog, Dirt, Diggers and Dinosaurs , his mum explains her reasons for holding him back by applying to defer his admission to school for a year. She starts by saying: We’ve done something that many of our friends and family will view as controversial. We have decided not to send Stanley to school this year. Instead, he will be starting next September when he is five. For the extra year he will be attending preschool part time, playing, bonding with his brothers, playing, exploring, enjoying days out, playing, growing and developing at his own pace. She then answers some of the questions she says she\u0027s been asked.  No, Stanley does not have any special educational needs. No, we haven’t ‘held him back’ because he was struggling at preschool. No, it’s not that we can’t bear to let him go, and I want to keep him a baby. No, we aren’t doing it for ourselves and not thinking about what’s best for him. No, we’ve not thrown our dummy out because he didn’t a place at our first choice of school this year... he did. No, we’ve not done what’s easiest for us.   As you can probably tell from the answers above, I’ve had a bit of an ear bashing by some which I hope is mostly fuelled by misinformation and misunderstanding, she says. Explaining her decision, she said: The plain fact is, he’s four. We’ve simply chosen not to send him to school early, we are sending him at school age which  you go back a generation was the absolute norm. I personally believe that in the UK all children start school too early and that we’d be better off following our European neighbours whose children start school at aged seven when they are emotionally and physically ready.  We were recently informed at a preschool parents evening that Stanley  would soon cope with starting school, as he’s really bright. This really hit home for me, a four year old shouldn’t have to cope with anything. Emma, from Hull, Yorkshire, who is expecting another baby, says she decided to write the blog to let other parents know it is possible to prevent your child from starting school at the age of four, as she believes it\u0027s not widely known. This year three set of parents have successfully applied to Hull City Council to defer their child\u0027s entry to school. Emma said: I’ve had two relative strangers - who I only know through ious kids clubs - tell me that they think it’s amazing, and one who asked me to email her the info so she could then look into it for her daughter. She had no idea that the option was available, which I think is a massive issue. Thanks to a change in DfE legislation, we not only have the choice whether to start his school journey prior to CSA or at CSA but also have the right to request admission into Reception class at CSA rather than Year One, ensuring that he will not lose a vital whole year of early education. I think an extra year of being a child with no responsibility or pressure can only be a good thing. When I read articles about phonics tests in Year one ages five and six and SATS at ages six and seven it makes me so sad. When did being a child become so target driven? Aren’t we told by midwives and health visitors that ‘they all learn at their own pace?\u0027 Why does this suddenly change when they enter the school system? The extra year at home will be an extra year of developing emotionally and at his own pace. An extra year of learning through play, exploration and love.  A controversial decision which is a big \u0027gamble\u0027 Emma said she 100 per cent believes she has made the right decision for Stanley, but admits there is a big gamble involved. She said: The BIG gamble in all of this and the only thing that regularly niggles at me is whether we will get offered our first choice school again in the next round of admissions. If we don’t, then will our offered school be happy to support a CSA Reception start, or will they be championing Year 1? The LEA and school would have to provide evidence that missing a whole year of education would be in his best interests. I guess we’ll just have to face any obstacles, and fight the battles as we get to them. However Emma signs the blog post off by saying as she sits there writing the post and watching Stanley performing a puppet show for his brother using three toy dinosaurs, she knows with all certainty that this is the best thing for her child.

Jurors were shown footage of Mohammed Abdul, 21, allegedly driving his Suzuki Vitara past bouncers and into revellers. CCTV footage appears to show the vehicle coursing down an alleyway packed with clubbers before later ploughing into the venue itself. From a camera inside Blake\u0027s in Gravesend, Kent, the vehicle\u0027s front lights can be seen getting closer and closer as dancers mingle, unaware the Suzuki is hurtling towards them.  One man can then be seen spread-eagled on the bonnet, swept off his feet as the Suzuki rams into him from behind. Others are seen fleeing to safety as security guards appear in hot pursuit of the car, shortly before midnight on March 17 this year. The car can be seen reversing, its registration plate hanging off at an angle, as patrons stagger to get to their feet. Some clubbers can be seen appearing to swarm the vehicle and showering it with a volley of thumps, while others look visibly distressed in the corner of the nightclub.  Abdul is on trial at Maidstone Crown Court for attempted murder over the incident which left eight people injured. The court heard he had been ejected from the venue at around 11.40pm for being too drunk. His trial was told that while in a rage and acting aggressively, he threatened bouncers, telling doorman Peter Muro: If I can\u0027t come in I\u0027m going to come back and shut this place down and kill you guys. Abdul ed in his vehicle around 10 minutes later and drove at speed down a narrow alleyway by the side of the club, with door staff and clubbers jumping or being pulled out of the way, prosecutor Simon Taylor said.  The alleyway housed a marquee attached to the club with a dance floor and DJ booth, and it was filled with revellers there to see grime rapper Giggs. Abdul, of Deptford, south-east London, accepts he was the driver of the vehicle and has admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving, jurors heard.

But Domestos believes that a clean and safe toilet should be within everyone’s reach so it is helping to answer the public’s prayers. Its Use Our Loos campaign, launched earlier this month, is inviting businesses across Britain to sign up, open their cubicles and welcome everyone - customers and non-customers - to use their loos. And they’ve also agreed to feature on the Great British Public Toilet Map – a free interactive street map developed by Domestos and Public Convenience. The map - the UK’s largest database of publicly-accessible toilets - includes lavs that are located in local businesses as well as those at bus and train stations, shopping centres, libraries, leisure centres and hotels.  And it’s compiled using information from councils, the businesses themselves and YOU! As well as using the map to discover nearby loos, the public can help improve the service by adding new locations or flagging loos that have closed. Anyone can go on the website and add or edit the correct information about the toilet such as who can access it, opening hours, or facilities available. Just click on the Great British Toilet Map image below to reveal the map and find your nearest available toilet...   By visiting toiletmap.org.uk on a computer of smartphone, your device will automatically find your location and reveal your nearest available toilets. Users can also look for loos before leaving their home or office by typing in a postcode to search other areas.  As well as pinpointing the exact location of nearby public toilets, helpful information is featured about each one including whether there’s a charge and  it has an attendant. There is also a tool which lets users set preferences to highlight any specic needs they might have, such as whether it has disabled access and baby changing facilities, and what the opening hours are.

When there are more than one million people on council house waiting lists and tenants are struggling to pay sky-high rents, a few words of synthetic compassion and a woolly promise of extra money won’t cut it. The Prime Minister dangled the offer of an extra \u0026pound2billion for housing associations but this will not be available until 2022 and will be spread over six years. Even  this cash does materialise it will hardly compensate for \u0026pound25billion cut from the housing budget since 2010.  Nor was there any acknowledgement from Mrs May that her government had raised council house rents, overseen a rise in homelessness and broken its promise to build a like-for-like replacement for every council house sold under right to buy. She then had the gall to claim the Tories were the champions of social housing.  To build the homes needed requires real ambition, not platitudes and piece-  meal funding.

These US giants make millions of pounds in profit in this country but drag their feet when it comes to paying their fair share of taxes. Starbucks will tell you its use of clever and complicated accounting methods is all above board. However there is a big dference between what is legally right and what is morally right.  While these firms employ expensive accountants to minimise tax bills it is left to the rest to plug the hole in the Treasury coffers.

CCTV, released by police, shows the deeply distressing last few moments 25-year-old Inna Petrova has with her tiny child, clutching her tightly, before she hands her over. The unemployed painter at one point can be seen turning her back on Natalia Zhdanova who has flown 1,970 miles from St Petersburg to Omsk collect the baby. But then Inna kisses her little one for the last time and hands over the child, who is cocooned in a bright pink wrap. Natalia then used a faked birth certicate - which listed the baby as hers - to show airport security before flying back to her home city with the child, police say.  Inna - who later said she was “hysterical” at giving away her child - is seen wiping tears from her eyes on the video, released by the Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes in Russia. She now admits she was wrong and says she wishes she could wind back the clock. Ahead of the child\u0027s birth, Natalia had sent Inna a payment of 3,000 roubles - just \u0026pound34. Natalia, a 43-year-old teacher, is said to have empty nest syndrome now her after her adult son left home, and wanted one last baby. She already bringing up another adopted daughter. Now both women have been formally detained as a criminal probe is launched under Russia’s child trafficking laws. They could each face up to ten years in jail.  Investigators say that Natalia posted an online advertisement saying: “Hi everyone! My husband and I would very much like to get a baby aged 0 to 3 months. All the documents for adoption are ready. Please send a private message for details. Girls, darlings, please help.” Inna - at the time pregnant after a short relationship with a man she met at a local cafe - replied: “Hello, I would like my daughter to be adopted. Please do so, I am not able to raise her, no chance”. She told police she lived with her mother and sister in a cramped apartment and they were furious when she became pregnant. They were adamant she should not keep the baby. Omsk prosecutor Vasily Gumenyuk said: “During our interrogation, the biological mother of the baby explained that she lived in a rented apartment with her mother and sister. “Both were strongly against the baby and put strong psychological pressure on the future mother.  “The young woman failed to get a job, and she was not married to the father of her baby. “He knew about her pregnancy but did not plan to support her. “She decided to give away the baby to the teacher from St Petersburg.” The baby deal would have remained secret but for Inna and her mother telling their landlady - who immediately informed police. Officers knocked on Natalie’s door in St Petersburg one week after the airport exchange. Inna said: “All the way through my pregnancy, my mother and sister were attacking me. “They wanted me to have an abortion. “My mother threatened me, saying ‘If you give birth, just don’t come back home, I won’t let you in!’” She said: “They told me a baby is not a toy.” “I posted in my social network that I needed help and Natalia Zhdanova replied.” She admitted she could have given the child up at her maternity hospital but chose not to and instead to hand the baby to Natalia who she had not previously met.  She was paid 3,000 roubles - sent in advance allegedly to cover the cost of nappies - but claimed Natalia also promised to help her and her family find jobs in St Petersburg. Asked about the moment she handed over the child, she said: “Of course it was hard. “I was in hysterics in the airport when it happened. “But Natalia’s  flight has already been announced, I had to give her my daughter so  could catch their plane. “My daughter was nine days old. I would have given her away earlier but we stayed in the hospital for a week, and then we lived at home for several days, but it was just impossible to be there because of constant scandals.” She said: “When the story became known, a friend of my mother said that she would have helped us.

Amnesty International has today demanded that Microsoft carries out a full investigation, claiming that investigators found youngsters being horrically treated. The charity alleges that children in the Democratic Republic of Congo  are toiling for 12 hours a day in cobalt mines in order to source metals used to make computer products. They are not even given gloves or masks to protect them from toxic dust, it is claimed, putting their health at serious risk. In testimony released by Amnesty International, a 14-year-old named Paul, who started working in mines when he was 12, said: I worked in the mines because my parents couldn’t afford to pay for food and clothes for me.  There is lots of dust. It is very easy to catch colds. We hurt all over. Amnesty claims it has studied public records to discover that cobalt mined in the DRC is used by some of the world\u0027s biggest tech companies. After sharing its concerns with these electronics giants, it says Microsoft has taken little action, despite its competitors responding to the allegations. A statement said: After raising our concerns, some companies we spoke to have taken steps to investigate their supply chains and have helped by publishing lists of their cobalt smelters and refiners in line with international standards.

Two were very dangerous and the third was the goal.“Fraser is definitely a leader but we must be careful with him because he had two cruciate ligament problems so it has not been easy for him to handle this psychologically.”Ahead of Saturday’s trip to face bottom side Falkirk, Csaba has decisions to make in his midfield.After his dominant 20-minute display at Tannadice, Fyvie will be in contention to start and Csaba also revealed Sam Stanton is close.“It is good that he is making competition.

It has been handed in to the council.A spokeswoman for the Highland LGBTI forum, which is organising the rally, said Mr Morrison was entitled to his opinions,\"I have no problem with him or the people who have signed the petition holding their views and I totally respect that but there are a lot of other people who don\u0026rsquot hold those views,\" she said.\"You will always get people who don\u0026rsquot like LGBT stuff.\"Referring to his comments about people frolicking on rainbow-coloured floats, she said: \"Basically this is a celebration and  he doesn\u0026rsquot like people dancing and enjoying themselves, I could see that would be a problem for him.\"She said there was nothing illegal about the proposed parade.\"Obviously, nothing untoward will be happening during the march,\" she said. \"It will be totally family-friendly.\"He has a moral objection which is his personal objection and he is perfectly entitled to that.

first","story":"\u0026nbspA DOCTOR and a former detective have joined forces to launch Scotland\u0027 first absinthe blanche using ingredients hand-picked from around their 500-year-old ancestral home by the shores of Loch Ness.The couple, Lorien and Kevin Cameron-Ross, creators of the award-winning Loch Ness Gin, developed the recipe for Loch Ness Absinthe, both distilled at their home on the banks of the loch, following a trip to the birthplace of the spirit, Val-de-Travers in Switzerland.It was there Lorien learned to fine-tune the craft of making absinthe which was first used as a medicinal remedy by a French doctor living in the country, Pierre Ordinaire around the 1790s.Although best known as absinthe verte, the notorious \"green drink\", popular in the late 19th and early 20th century among artists and writers in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh and Ernest Hemmingway among its devotees, the couple decided to create their own Scottish blanche recipe.Blanche absinthe dates back to 1910 following the ban of green absinthe in ious countries \u0026ndash although not in the UK \u0026ndash due to unproven fears it had hallucinogenic properties resulting from the use of thujone, a component of wormwood.This led to the illegal production of clear absinthe in Switzerland, making it harder for the authorities to identy.Lorien said: \"We are really proud of our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe, boasting our very own homegrown botanicals including wormwood mixed with nearby fresh water which flows into the famous loch.\"We felt there was gap in the market for an absinthe blanche in Scotland, a drink I really enjoy, so decided to put the wheels in motion last year and began to research its history and fully understand the craft of creating and distilling it.\"Loch Ness Absinthe, with a ABV of 53 per cent, is less potent that absinthe verte, which is usually around 72 per cent.The couple, who are firm believers in mindful drinking where you drink less and enjoy yourself more, recommend that Loch Ness Absinthe should be enjoyed slowly as an aperit, ideally in a mix of one-part absinthe to three parts iced water, poured over a sugar cube on the glass\u0027 rim.Lorien continued: \"I\u0026rsquove worked really hard to get the recipe for our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe exactly the way I wanted and in the process perfected the art of distilling it to get the exact results I was looking for.\"With the help and support of Kevin, I\u0026rsquove created a drink that I\u0026rsquom really pleased with, which has already received fantastic feedback, leading to us driving our plans forward to launch even more products in the near future that will continue to be inspired by the loch and the land around us.\"Thursday 20 Sep 2018

march","story":"\u0026nbspA GAY pride march in Inverness could get the green light as early as this week.The planned Proud Ness parade, which is expected to take place in Inverness on October 6, has been overshadowed by a row between religious objectors and counter petitions.The row erupted last week, shortly after Donald Morrison, a home mission worker with the Free Church of Scotland , submitted a petition of around 600 to 700 names opposing what he deemed the \"unsavoury event\".The move sparked a furious response from other sections of the community, with three separate petitions launched supporting the Gay Pride march. They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Thursday 20 Sep 2018 10:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

McKenna’s ascent has been rapid as the defender has started every game he has been fit for.Aston Villa and Celtic’s rejected bids were the latest in a number of moves for the centre-back.Hull City had three bids, with the final in excess of £1m, knocked back in January and Swansea City also made an approach for McKenna during the summer.McInnes said: “Scott deals with everything in his stride.“We are not dealing with someone who is a standard footballer.“He is something a bit special.“All he thought about was getting himself ready for the St Johnstone game.“They don’t make them like Scott too often these days.“He is a brilliant boy.“With all the experience I have in the game I can say to Scott with so much confidence that his time will come. Scott backs himself and trusts me.”McInnes recently claimed that McKenna, contracted to the Dons until 2023, will eventually leave Pittodrie on a “big ticket” move to the English Premier League.That could be as early as January  a club come in with a bid that meets the Reds’ valuation, early enough to find a replacement in that window.McKenna’s  from injury was a welcome boost at a time when eight players were ruled out for the trip to St Johnstone by injury or suspension.McInnes said: “Scott’s level of performance has been outstanding since he got into the team.“Defensively we have not been too bad and it has not been our biggest area of concern.“However, Scott’s  gives everyone a boost.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen woman sentenced for nuisance calls to emergency services","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen woman has been given unpaid work and a supervision order after making nuisance calls to emergency services.Elizabeth Ewan or Slessor, 59, appeared in the dock for sentencing having previously pled guilty to making repeated calls to police and the Scottish Ambulance Service on August 27 or 28 last year when no emergency existed.Sentence had previously been deferred for a psychiatric report.Defence agent Michael Burnett said: “The issue is drink.”Sherf Sukhwinder Gill told Slessor, of Great Western Road, Aberdeen: “When you’re phoning the emergency services you’re preventing genuine callers from getting through and you must know that.”She ordered her to be supervised for 12 months and carry out 100 hours of unpaid work in six months.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/5ba0973c62722-705x564.jpg ","title":"daily lives explored as aberdeen photographer goes face to face for year long portrait project","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHundreds of portraits of north-east residents have formed part of a year-long photography project.Chris Henderson, a wedding and portrait photographer, has been photographing a person a day for the past year as part of a fun Instagram project.Every picture taken for Aberdeen photographer\u0026#8217s Instagram portrait project\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/every-picture-taken-for-aberdeen-photographers-instagram-portrait-project/embed/#?secret=ej47imVawl\" data-secret=\"ej47imVawl\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Every picture taken for Aberdeen photographer\u0026#8217s Instagram portrait project\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"The rules were simple – to shoot, edit and upload a portrait photo every day, to find a new subject every day with no repeats and no self-portraits being allowed.Uploaded on his Instagram account chrshndrsn, portraits involve a range of male and female subjects, and include a caption with information about how he met the person and some details about them or the conversation they had at the time.He began the project on September 13 2017, posting an image of fellow wedding photographer Calum Riddell.

He said: “There were a couple of times I had to chase people down the street saying ‘excuse me’.“I started off with friends and family and former colleagues, but people started coming to me.“The vast majority have been people who have approached me.“There’s no way I would have been able to do it myself just having to approach people in the street.“It ended up being a snowball effect.“The idea of doing a picture a day is not something I dreamed up, it’s something a lot of photographers do.” Working as a wedding photographer, Chris often has to work with a backdrop that is outwith his control, so the project allowed him to look at dferent technical aspects while fuelling his love for portrait photography.He said: “It ties in with my interests. I like taking pictures of people.“Taking a picture of a dferent person every day meant I couldn’t fall back on the same people every day. I’ve allowed myself a bit of flexibility as well.”Although two thirds of his portraits ended up being volunteers, it wasn’t always easy to get people to take part.Chris likened the process to the famine and the feast, and said there were times he struggled to get back to people in time and others when he had only six hours left to find someone.With the end of the project nearing, he will be relaxing for a bit, but hopes to continue on the project in the future.He added: “I definitely want to keep doing something. Who knows, maybe in three months’ time.”There will be an exhibition held at Foodstory, which will begin in early October, upstairs in the cafe.To view the project, visit www.instagram/chrshndrsn.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"every picture taken for aberdeen photographers instagram portrait project","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEvery day for the last year Aberdeen photographer Chris Henderson has captured a portrait a day \u0026#8211 here we show every single picture taken so far.Daily lives explored as Aberdeen photographer goes face to face for year-long Instagram project\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/daily-lives-explored-as-aberdeen-photographer-goes-face-to-face-for-year-long-portrait-project/embed/#?secret=jpVp6MTMOo\" data-secret=\"jpVp6MTMOo\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Daily lives explored as Aberdeen photographer goes face to face for year-long Instagram project\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"storm ali north east road shut after high winds blow down tree1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA busy north-east road has been shut this afternoon as strong winds have reportedly blown a tree down.Bus services and motorists have been erted after the tree fell on the A93 between Drumoak and Crathes.Stagecoach has apologised to passengers for delays and say their 201 and 202 service has been erted.Storm Ali: Winds of up to 75mph set to batter north-east as Met Office extends weather warning\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/winds-of-up-to-75mph-set-to-batter-north-east-as-met-office-extends-weather-warning1/embed/#?secret=G3o25CYrgX\" data-secret=\"G3o25CYrgX\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Storm Ali: Winds of up to 75mph set to batter north-east as Met Office extends weather warning\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u0026mdash StagecoachNScot  September 19, 2018\u0026mdash StagecoachNScot  September 19, 2018\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"storm ali watch people struggle to stay on their feet as ferocious wind closes va dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tV\u0026ampA Dundee has closed to new visitors after ferocious Storm Ali wind swept people off their feet outside.Staff at the venue, which opened over the weekend, say “exceptionally high winds” at the entrance mean they are preventing new access this afternoon.The Courier witnessed members of the public struggling to stay upright as wind whipped in from the River Tay.

The boys have been winning but you want to be involved.“It’s doubly frustrating, in a sense, because you’re well looked after at the club and there are people trying to help you and asking you how you are and you want to tell them you’re fit.“But it takes time and thankfully now I’ve got better in the last couple of weeks.“So hopefully I’ll get my opportunity soon and I can show what I’m about.”Boyle has seen fellow defender Mick Dunlop  from injury in the last couple of weeks and hopes he can follow in his footsteps back into the Peterhead team, although he knows he may have to wait for an opportunity to  when others have been performing well in his absence.Boyle added: “Mick Dunlop has managed to get back and he came off the bench and then started on Saturday.“There’s no saying that’s the path I’ll take but hopefully  we’re winning the game on Saturday then the manager will be able to put me on.“He might think there are other, better subs to make but I want to get on the park and play as soon as possible.“The team has been winning and it’s easier to get into a losing team but I want to get into a winning team because it’s better to play in a team like that.“I might have to wait for my chance but when I get it I hope to take it.”Peterhead are second in League Two with 13 points from six games ahead of Saturday’s clash with Berwick. Boyle is happy with their start and believes they can kick on due to the increased competition in the Blue Toon squad.The  of Dunlop and Boyle, as well as the signing of Ryan Dow, means there are plenty of people vying for a starting spot in Jim McInally’s team. Boyle believes having competition within the Balmoor squad will help the team push on in the coming weeks.He said: “We’ve done well in the league, it has been a bit of a mish-mash at times because of injuries.“But we have got results and performances have improved as the weeks have gone on and now we’ve gone from having two or three options on the bench to Saturday against Cowdenbeath where we had six or seven.“With everyone fit there is going to be competition and hopefully that can take us to the next level in terms of performance.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities.

May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust. The next championships will be held at Inveralmond Community High School, Livingston, on Sunday March 10 2019.More details are on our website \u0026#8211 www.thechampionships.Last March, 145 schools from Scotland and two from England were represented at the championships, with a category for all standards of playing.Five years ago we introduced a new category of \u0026#8216freestyle\u0026#8217.  The aim of this is to provide an opportunity for schools to showcase their other musical skills alongside those of their pipers.The Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust  hopes many young pipers and drummers from Mid Argyll \u0026#8211 with other musicians too  entering the freestyle event – will participate in next year’s championships.Patrick Gascoigne, administrator, Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"storm ali halts ardrishaig canal bridge resurfacing","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 18/09/18, 6:18 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOvernight improvement works on A83 at the Ardrishaig swing bridge have been postponed due to the expected arrival of Storm Ali.A BEAR Scotland statement said: \u0026#8216Please be advised that Wednesday night\u0026#8217s  planned overnight road improvements for a section of the A83 south of Ardrishaig have been postponed due to forecast inclement weather.\u0026#8217An overnight road closure was due to be in place during work to resurface a section of the A83 on approach to the bridge, which spans the Crinan Canal, but the road will now be open as normal instead.The project will now be carried out at a future date.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"things are heating up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/09/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Meet Ritchie Pannell and Sue MacPhee, the newest additions to the Lochgilphead community.Bringing their daughter Brie up from Glasgow, Ritchie and Sue are opening a stove showroom on Lorne Street, Lochgilphead named RS StoveCraft.Ritchie said: ‘Obviously this is a big change in lestyle and we wanted to pursue our dream of developing a showroom.

The Shanghai visitors were enthralled by the salmon cutting, curing and smoking process, every step seemingly captured on film \u0026#8211 except, of course, the mixing of the company\u0026#8217s secret salmon curing recipe. \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s based on salt and sugar\u0026#8217 was as much as Richard would reveal.There was a little puzzlement at the oyster sheds when it was explained that the iety cultivated are from the Pacic, but the sheer scale and emphasis on quality impressed them hugely. And the method of knocking oyster shells together to check for freshness is one that is certain to be deployed in the Shanghai fish markets.Lestyle guru Ya Shu said: \u0026#8216The system here is incredible. I have never seen anything like it.\u0026#8217It was back across to the restaurant to sample a mouth-watering selection of seafood dishes prepared by a team led by Calum Hall, Loch Fyne Oysters\u0026#8217 head chef.Before any food could be sampled, it had to be photographed. And filmed by mobile phone. And photographed some more.Plate after plate of food was served \u0026#8211 from langoustines to chilli and cheddar oysters, and from scallops to whisky-infused smoked salmon.The visitors thoroughly enjoyed it. \u0026#8216The food is very dferent from what we are used to,\u0026#8217 said Qui Qui. \u0026#8216But it is very good.\u0026#8217Ya Shu went from oyster sceptic in Shanghai to Loch Fyne Oyster lover. \u0026#8216I had a plate full of oysters, which I never liked before coming here, he said.\u0026#8216I also liked very much the smoked salmon, langoustines and scallops.\u0026#8217Well fed and watered, the group left Cairndow bound for Edinburgh while as the next leg of their 10-day UK tour, six of which were spent in Scotland and the rest in London.Chinese followers of fashion clearly like what Qui Qui does. A following of 566,000 people testies to her popularity. And with his words of wisdom on areas such as food, drink  and world travel, Ya Shu attracts no fewer than three quarters of a million followers to his blog.If just a fraction of these 1.3 million blog fans are intrigued enough to visit the UK, it will be money well spent for Visit Britain.These Chinese visitors fell in love with Scotland \u0026#8211 and not a blue-painted Australian in sight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish authors past and present celebrated at tarbert book festival","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/09/18, 6:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere are still tickets available to attend the ious workshops of the long-awaited Tarbert Book Festival.In its sixth round, the annual programme of literary and poetic expression will run from Friday October 26 to Sunday October 28 and host writers from all over Argyll.On Saturday October 27, Robert Louis Stevenson is the subject of the opening sessions of this year’s weekend with Liz Shaw bringing her historical novel, ‘No Safe Anchorage’, followed by Bella Bathurst talking about ‘The Lighthouse Stevensons’, and Joseph Farrell concentrating on a new account of the final years the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde author spent in the South Pacic, with his book ‘Robert Louis Stevenson in Samoa’.Closing the Saturday programme is an appearance by Bella Bathurst when she will discuss ‘Sound: A Story of Hearing Lost and Found’, which is her acclaimed account of the experience of going deaf in adulthood and how she eventually recovered.Tarbert Academy will host visits from Scottish poet, Stuart Paterson, and from the creator of the Sandy Seal books, Helen Cormack.Friday evening sees the awarding of the annual writing competition prizes in Loch Fyne Gallery.

Karen Wylie, 39, is hoping to raise \u0026pound80,000 to fly son Saul - who suffers from Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy - to America for surgery which will allow him to stand independently and potentially walk. The Post reported earlier this year on the family’s campaign to help Saul whose condition causes muscle stfness in his legs and arms, meaning he cannot stand or walk unaided. The family, from Tarbolton, are fundraising so they can travel the 4000 miles to Missouri for a spinal operation which would dramatically reduce Saul’s spasticity. They hope to take Saul to St Louis Children’s Hospital to see Dr TS Park, a pioneer in Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy  surgery. Karen said: “Our objective is to get Saul to the best possible stage to allow us to apply to St Louis Children’s Hospital for him to be evaluated for this le-changing surgery. This will involve intense physiotherapy blocks, the purchase of specialised equipment and working closely with ious professional therapists to get him strong enough. This will take some time but no dream will ever be too big for our boy, it might just take a little longer to get there.” Saul was born with twin brother Clay 12 weeks’ premature. Clay weighed 3lbs and Saul just 1lb. Clay was treated at Crosshouse Hospital near Kilmarnock for three months to allow his lungs to develop and learn to feed and has now made a full recovery. However, Saul was kept in Yorkhill Hospital for six months and spent most of his first year in hospital as he was so fragile. At 18 months old, he was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy. When Karen was pregnant with the twins, she and her husband Stuart were given the devastating news that Clay had a better chance of survival  Saul were to be terminated, something that was never option for them. Karen said: “We were told on several occasions that Saul was too tiny to survive but he continues to defy the experts and he is our little fighter.” Not a keen runner, Karen – who gave up work when the twins were born and cares for Saul on a full-time basis – is taking on the 10k with a group of 25 friends and her 66-year-old mum in order to raise the \u0026pound80,000 needed to take Saul to America. Karen said: “I am not a runner, but have been training three times a week for the event and can now manage to run 4.5 miles. My mum has never done anything like this before so is extremely nervous but very determined to complete the race for her grandson. “Our fundraising total is set at \u0026pound80,000 to cover my son’s surgery, specialised equipment, intense physio and a two- year rehabilitation programme. We have been campaigning for 18 weeks and have raised an incredible \u0026pound41,000 so far. “We have been overwhelmed by the kindness of friends and family who are willing to help raise funds for Saul’s journey, their generosity is very much appreciated and our family are exceedingly grateful to everyone who’s helped us on this journey. “We were extremely proud when Saul started school with his twin Clay and older brother Mylo, eight, this year. He attends Tarbolton Primary School and has several classroom assistants who support him depending on what activities are being done each day. “Like every parent we long for endless opportunities for our son. We are exceedingly grateful to everyone who has supported us on Saul’s journey to help make his dream come true – to walk like his brothers.” The run is on Sunday, September 30.

Eyewitnesses described a noise like an earthquake as the roof came crashing to the ground in Ayr\u0027s Phillips Square. Cars, including a Subaru Imprezza, were crushed underneath as the effect of Storm Ali was felt in full force. The impact of the storm blew the top of the flats off at around 1pm today. Resident David Hose, who stays on the top floor of the block, described the horrying moment.  David, 28, told the Ayrshire Post: It sounded like a mini earthquake, it was a bang like I\u0027d never heard before. I looked outside and couldn\u0027t believe what I was seeing. The roof was lying on the ground on top of cars and not far from the school playground. It\u0027s a miracle it didn\u0027t kill anyone. Gordon Baillie, 36, a night porter at Ayr\u0027s Mercure Hotel, added: I was sitting on the couch watching telly and heard a big bang.

My partner is still at work so he\u0027ll get a fright when he comes home. Emergency services have now shut off the road in a bid to clear the scene.

Mason recalls: “He got to be involved in some pretty exciting things by all accounts. “He was on duty for the state visit of Nelson Mandela and because of his work I was born down in London.”  But the former car salesman, who served Arnold Clark Toyota in Ayr and Kilmarnock, would become renowned for his service to Ayr Boswell. Mason said: “He set up the 1997s team with Stevie Devlin and brought through so many kids, myself included. “We’ll have so many memories - as diehard Ayr fans we loved going to Somerset Park. “It’s no coincidence that the last game we went to together was when we beat Killie and our picture ended up on the back page of the Ayrshire Post! “He was my dad, best mate and coach all in one.” A fundraiser of former Boswell players raised more than \u0026pound8000 at Dam Park this summer.

increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff

local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants,

customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum.

formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to

Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

This is the only means available of being able to control dogs causing persistent problems with livestock at the present time.  I believe this has stopped another attack by these dogs. Unfortunately, once these dogs have a taste for it, they are likely to attack again, and I fear the next time it may not be an animal, but someone’s child,\u0026#8217 he added,Andrew McCornick, NFU Scotland President said: \u0026#8216Livestock worrying continues to be a blight on Scottish agriculture, and greater sanctions and further public awareness are needed so dog owners are fully aware of their responsibilities to keep their animals under control.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

He said: \u0026ldquoWe are about to begin consultation on our plans for the next stage of development at the National Museum of Flight and warmly invite members of the public to come and hear our plans and tell us what they think.  \u0026ldquoWe are working with Hoskins Architects to design an entirely new hangar to be built on land right next to the museum\u0026rsquos home at East Fortune Airfield.  \u0026ldquoThis would provide a permanent home for the museum\u0026rsquos star attraction, Scotland\u0026rsquos Concorde, and help us protect other historically important aircraft which are currently at risk because they are displayed outdoors.  \u0026ldquoThe new building would enable us to signicantly improve the experience for visitors to the museum by creating a new entrance with better public facilities.  \u0026ldquoIt also presents us with the opportunity to rethink and enhance the presentation of the historic Second World War airfield, which is an important artefact in its own right.  The plans will be revealed for the first time on Tuesday at Haddington\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre.  The drop-in session, which runs from 3pm to 7pm, will allow members of the public to see the initial designs and also speak to members of the team behind the proposals.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.  Mr Lindgren\u0026rsquos funeral at Musselburgh Congregational Church and Seafield Crematorium was well attended by the community of Musselburgh and Fisherrow.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"relieve-the-gsa-of-responsibility-for-mackintosh-building-art-experts-suggestion-to-msps","story":"  Currently burnt-out, the Mackintosh Building is still at the heart, and perhaps is the soul, of the art school.  However, should the building, disastrously ruined by fire twice in four years, still be run by the educational institution?  That is the provocative question that will be posed to Members of the Scottish Parliament tomorrow by one of Scotland\u0027s leading Mackintosh experts, the writer and gallerist Roger Billclfe.  Mr Billclfe, a vocal critic of the GSA\u0027s responsibility for, and handling of, the building\u0027s first fire in 2014, has suggested in a submission to MSPs that the GSA should be \"relieved of the responsibility\" of the \u0027Mack\u0027.  He says that by the time the building is rebuilt - which GSA chair Muriel Gray said could take up to six years - it will have not been used as a place of teaching for more than a dozen years.  Billclfe believes that the building should be treated as a \"world class work of art\" and could be used as artist accommodation and for exhibitions.  : The Mackintosh Building will be rebuilt says chair  In the conclusion to his submission he says that, because of the unanswered questions around the 2014 fire, the GSA is \"unfit\" to be a custodian of the building.  Mr Billclfe said: \"Temporary accommodation put in force after the 2014 fire will likely have had to be replaced by more permanent arrangements.  \"This seems to be a suitable time to consider relieving the School of its responsibility for the Mackintosh building - something it is believed to have considered in the 1990s when it offered the building to a government agency - and removing the inherent dangers associated with its occupation by a large body of students.  \"This would remove from the School the apparent burden of running a major \u0026lsquomuseum\u0026rsquo and also satisfy the growing demand for access, particularly after the injection of \u0026pound30m of public, private and charitable donations to restore the building following the 2014 fire.\"  Mr Billclfe, whose latest book is \u0027Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Art of the Four\u0027, believes the Mackintosh Building, consumed in a blaze for which no cause has yet been established, should be rebuilt from the architect\u0027s plans.  : How the Mack will be remade: Muriel Gray interview  The Committee\u0026nbspis also hearing evidence from Eileen Reid, the former head of widening participation at the school, the architect Malcolm Fraser, and Stuart Robertson, director of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society.  The prospect of the GSA giving up their right to the building appears unlikely.  However, there was much anger expressed after the June fire, and how two blazes could have occurred in four years.  The first fire, in 2014, was sparked by an projector igniting some expanded foam being used by a student for a degree show.  Until the police and fire service investigation into the new blaze is complete and published, observers, the public and alumni are in want of reply to questions over cause and responsibility.  : The new Mack will be paid for by insurance and fund raising  A spokesman for the GSA said: \"The Mackintosh Building was commissioned and designed as an art school and GSA is fully committed to it ing as a working art school.\"  In the Herald on Sunday, the chair of the GSA board, Muriel Gray, was adamant the GSA will restore the Mackintosh Building.  Ms Gray said: \"This time it will be built with such knowledge and expertise that we have learned since 2014.  \"We are resolved that the Mackintosh comes back as a working art school, as a major player, a cultural leader for the city and the Scottish economy.\"  She added: \"Imagine the thrill of saying, \u0027We have an architect for this project: who is it? Charles Rennie Mackintosh.\u0027\"  \"The roads lead back to Mackintosh, absolutely and non-negotiably.  \"As far as we are concerned that decision we made in 2014 has just been interrupted.\"  It has been estimated that the cost could be more than \u0026pound100m, but Ms Gray said she hoped this would be met by insurance and a private funding raising initiative, rather than rely on public funds.  : Mackintosh expert on the rebuild at book festival  The building was insured through an Owner Controlled Insurance Programme .  This was held in the name of the GSA and Kier Construction Scotland Limited, which was in charge of the works at the building.  The restoration of the school following the 2014 fire was due to cost \u0026pound49m in total.  A paper for the Committee says that the GSA have \"communicated with donors regarding the 2018 fire and no donor has requested a  of their donation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-potent-questions-linger-around-the-mack-and-the-gsa","story":"  However, after two fires in four years, not only Mr Billclfe, who suggests the change in his submission to the Culture Committee of the Scottish Parliament, has expressed frustration and anger at the GSA.  In his submission, he says the Mack is a world class work of art - and should be henceforth treated as such.  He writes: \u0026ldquoIt would be unthinkable to restore a work of art from the National Galleries, say, and then offer access to it to the person who damaged it in the first place. But this is the scenario  the building is still to be retained by the School of Art on its current basis.  He also calls for a full investigation into the school\u0026rsquos administration at the time of the 2014 fire and subsequent refurbishment.  Billclfe, as others do, believes that the causes and circumstances of the original fire still pose many questions.  There is often anger when there are no quick or ready answers to potent and emotional questions. The world is waiting for the police and fire officers to investigate the ruins of the Mack, to find out what caused or accelerated the blaze this summer. I understand that the current theory is that the fire began in the roof of the east gable of the building, and then spread west and down to the ABC venue.

It followed a leak of papers from Brussels negotiators that the EU was edging towards a deal with the UK over Northern Ireland that would use technology to create a frictionless border.  The arrangement would maintain close alignment with the single market.  A newspaper report said the leak stated the solution was \u0026ldquospecically phrased for Northern Ireland so that it is not applicable for Scotland. A UK concern.  However Nicola Sturgeon has argued Scotland should be able to enjoy the same relationship as Ulster.  She tweeted in December \u0026ldquoIf one part of UK can retain regulatory alignment with EU and effectively stay in the single market, which is the right solution for Northern Ireland, there is surely no good practical reason why others can\u0026rsquot.  Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland yesterday, Mr Russell said: \u0026ldquoIf this is true then this is duplicity of a very serious degree by the UK government.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made it clear, both publicly and privately, over a long period of time, that whilst we entirely support a borderless Ireland...  there are advantages for Northern Ireland then Scotland could not stand idly by, and quite obviously so.  \"We voted, like Northern Ireland, not to Leave. Our economies are closely intertwined.  Asked whether there was a case for Northern Ireland having a unique arrangement given its history and its land border with another EU country, he said: \u0026ldquoWe would then border an EU country in those circumstances because the border would be in the Irish Sea.  \u0026ldquoBut it\u0026rsquos not an EU proposal. What the Times has reported is that the UK would be making it a condition that it [the deal] was written in such a way that Scotland could not take advantage of it.  \u0026ldquoIf they wanted to do that, they should have said to us - because there are open negotiations, the Joint Ministerial Committee is meeting - by the way, this is what we\u0026rsquore saying as part of the Northern Irish deal. They\u0026rsquove not done so.  \u0026ldquoNow that is neither fair nor welcome, and that is something we will be raising as a very serious issue.  He said he accepted there should be no border between Northern Ireland the republic, but he also said Scotland had voted heavily to Remain in the EU, and had long argued that a separate system for Scotland known as \u0026ldquodferentiation was possible.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have shown how that is possible, and we have published material on it. So  there\u0026rsquos an attempt to tie us to the UK, to drag us out against our will then we are absolutely right to object to that, particularly  it\u0026rsquos being done in secret.  Asked  the SNP would support a second vote on Brexit, Mr Russell said he would be \u0026ldquohappy to sit down with the LibDems and other proponents of a People\u0026rsquos Vote.

They, claimed the Lib Dem chief, had turned from \u0026ldquobroad churches into intolerant cults.  Which, of course, has left the fourth force in Westminster politics with a golden opportunity.  Yet despite the fact that loyal lieutenants were stressing how the party had doubled its appeal, from 7.4 per cent at the last election to 11 per cent-plus now - actually, a recent poll put the Lib Dems on just six per cent - the yellow peril is not picking up support anywhere near where it should be.  Sir Nick Clegg branded Jeremy Corbyn and Labour \u0026ldquopants, while he dismissed Theresa May and the Tories as \u0026ldquorubbish. Yet,  this is true, then the Lib Dem surge should be happening.

And he sought to pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn over the People\u0026rsquos Vote issue by telling the Labour comrades that  their leader does not back the second poll, then they should dump him.  But  the Lib Dems are to capitalise on the anti-Brexit sentiment, then they need an energetic, charismatic leader, who doesn\u0026rsquot fluff his lines, to lead the charge to keep Britain in the EU as soon as possible.

Tonight, the PM is expected to have face-to-face talks with Charles Michel, the Belgian premier, with further bilaterals with Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach, and Donald Tusk, the European Council President, tomorrow.  Mrs May is likely also to talk to other leaders in the margins of the summit in an effort to win backing for a plan which has met fierce resistance from within the ranks of her own Conservative Party.  Her message will be stark:  the EU does not show flexibility and the only deal she can take back to Westminster in November is an unsellable fudge, then MPs will vote it down and there will be a damaging no-deal.  In referring to the EU27\u0026rsquos improved offer, Mr Barnier also made clear that the \u0026ldquomoment of truth would come next month at the European Council. By then, he argued, it should be clear whether or not a deal can be done.  However, Brussels-watchers point out that there is a habit of the European Commission going to the brink and the Salzburg summiteers are expected to announce a special Council meeting in November, probably on the 13th and 14th, to formally seal a deal.  In an interview with the  today Mrs May said hers was the \"right plan\" for the UK while representing a \"good deal for the EU\".  She insisted: \"I\u0027m not going to be pushed away from doing what is necessary to get the right deal for Britain.\"  In her Die Welt article, the PM argues that the Chequers blueprint - a \"common rulebook\" for trade in goods and \"business-friendly facilitated customs arrangement\" - is the only way to resolve the thorny issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  \"It is profoundly in both sides\u0027 economic interest, it respects the integrity of the single market and, crucially, no one else has come up with a proposal that could command cross-community support in Northern Ireland that is the only true foundation for stability there.\"  She adds: \u0026ldquoTo come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same.  Ahead of today\u0026rsquos summit, Mr Tusk wrote to EU leaders said EU leaders should discuss arrangements for the \"final phase\" of the Brexit talks \"including the possibility of calling another European Council in November\".  He impressed on them the need for \"limiting the damage\" caused by Brexit and added: \u0026ldquoUnfortunately, a no-deal scenario is still quite possible.

He asserted Mrs May\u0026rsquos ultimatum of her deal or no deal was a false choice and predicted the EU would \"pile on\" extra demands on money, migration and other issues.  \"All these things will come back and we\u0027ll see more and more pressure, and she will have a deal she won\u0027t be able to bring back to the House of Commons because it\u0027ll be lumbered with loads of other EU demands, so she\u0027s going to have to have something else,\" he told BBC Radio\u0026rsquos Today programme.

The former Holyrood Presiding Officer\u0026rsquos remarks came as campaigners for a second EU referendum set out a roadmap to obtain a \"People\u0027s Vote\" giving the public the final say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations.  The People\u0027s Vote report, written by Scottish peer Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who authored Article 50, suggested the PM could be forced to concede a second referendum by a vote of MPs in Parliament or that she could even decide to call one herself.  And it insisted that the option of staying in the EU \"must be on the ballot paper\".  But Mrs May brushed aside the calls for a second referendum, saying voters had already made their decision.  \"When the referendum took place, we gave people the opportunity to make a choice. They made that choice,\" she declared.  \"This was probably the biggest exercise in democracy in our country\u0027s history. If we were to go back on that vote, it would destroy trust in politicians.  \"My answer to the People\u0027s Vote is that we\u0027ve had the people\u0027s vote - it was the referendum - and now we should deliver on it,\" she added.  The report argues that the March 29 2019 deadline for Brexit could easily be delayed to make time for a vote to be held.  And it warned that politicians would be judged harshly  they denied calls for a People\u0027s Vote on the grounds that it would be too dficult to arrange in the short time remaining.  \"More than two years since the 2016 referendum, a political, economic and possibly constitutional crisis is gathering across the United Kingdom,\" said Lord Kerr, a former head of the diplomatic service.  \"Our view is that the most viable and democratic way of resolving it is to allow the public to have their say on Brexit. To deny them a voice challenges the basic principle of informed consent.\"  And the crossbench peer warned: \"History will not, in our opinion, be kind to any politician who hides behind purely logistical arguments, legalese or arcane parliamentary procedure in order to deny people a vote on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations at such a fragile and crucial moment for our country.\"  With opinion polls regularly finding a majority of voters now think the UK made the wrong decision to leave in 2016, the People\u0027s Vote report said it was not too late to \"think again\" about Brexit.  There was \"no insurmountable political or procedural obstacle\" to putting the two-year Article 50 process on hold to provide time for the necessary legislation and practical arrangements to be put in place for a vote, it argued.  And the report said a decision to dump Brexit now would be \"cost-free\" as the UK could retain its existing EU membership terms, including its budget rebate and exemption from joining the euro - while rejoining years later would require them to be renegotiated from scratch.  Drawn up by a cross-party committee including pro-EU MPs, peers and MEPs from Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens, the roadmap outlined six possible routes to a fresh referendum but said others may emerge as events develop.  The report explained that  Mrs May secured a deal with Brussels this autumn, MPs could use parliamentary amendments to force a referendum either when voting on the deal itself or on later legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement.  If her deal were rejected by the Commons, it would be up to Speaker John Bercow to decide whether or not to permit MPs to vote on a fresh referendum when the PM faced Parliament to explain her next steps.  Although Mrs May has consistently said that she would not allow a second referendum, the report suggested she might decide that a public vote was the best way to win a mandate for her deal or to escape the \"constitutional crisis\" of no deal.  \"Facing the very real possibility of overseeing a deeply unpopular and potentially disastrous no-deal Brexit, she may decide that the only way to avert this outcome is to put her deal to the public through a People\u0027s Vote,\" suggested the report.  The sixth option of a vote following victory for a pro-referendum party in a snap general election within the next few months was judged \"very unlikely but not inconceivable\".  The roadmap made no recommendation on the question to be asked in any poll, something that would ultimately be a matter for the independent Electoral Commission.  But it said that, for reasons of \"simplicity, speed and clarity\", it was likely that a two-way choice - either \"the Government\u0027s deal versus stay\" or \"no deal versus stay\" - would be preferred over a multiple choice question.  Any vote should not be delayed by arguments over whether to extend the franchise to include 16 and 17-year-olds and expats or tighten social media rules.  But the report said social media companies should be warned they would face tougher regulation in future  they failed to take all actions within their power to prevent abuse of their platforms by campaigns.  David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, asked how likely a second referendum would be  Parliament willed it, replied: \"Pretty unlikely because most people understand to announce a second referendum would be to invite the European Union to give us the worst deal possible in order to persuade us to stay in.  \"That\u0027s the consequence of a second referendum and is why it\u0027s a very bad idea it\u0027s completely against the national interest.\""},{"url":null,"title":"labour-ends-funding-for-kezia-dugdales-defence-in-wings-over-scotland-defamation-case","story":"  The move, which exposes Kezia Dugdale to potentially signicant costs, has been seen by some of her fellow MSPs as a \u0026ldquobetrayal and \u0026ldquofactionalism by her pro-Corbyn enemies.

It is understood UK Labour, which raised \u0026pound56m last year, did not tell Ms Dugdale directly of its decision, but informed her lawyers that it was no longer standing behind her case.  Ms Dugdale, 37, who was Scottish Labour leader from 2015 to 2017, opposed Jeremy Corby becoming UK leader, earning the lasting resentment of his supporters, who now dominate the party apparatus.  As the publisher of Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos column, it is understood the Daily Record may now supply Ms Dugdale with legal support for the rest of the case.  However any help would not extend to damages and costs  Mr Campbell won his case.  Earlier this month, Sherf Kenneth McGowan refused Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos request to have the action thrown out and agreed to proceed to an evidential hearing.  Ms Dugdale had been on the point of appealing that decision when UK Labour withdrew its support, forcing her to scramble to lodge the appeal.  Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos spokesman said: \u0026ldquoGiven the principles on which it was founded - equality, fairness and justice - the UK Labour Party wholeheartedly committed to paying all legal costs associated with this case from start to finish.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much hoped that all promises will be kept.  UK Labour said: \u0026ldquoIt would be inappropriate to comment on a live, ongoing legal case.

Wales voted to leave the bloc by a margin of 52.5 to 47.5 per cent in the 2016 referendum, although recent polls have suggested a swing towards remain. In Scotland, there was a strong majority \u0026ndash 62 to 38 per cent \u0026ndash to remain.  Setting out what he believes should happen  the Prime Minister secured a withdrawal agreement with Brussels, Mr Jones said: \"The next step is to see whether a deal can be supported by, for me, parliaments plural: Westminster, Edinburgh and Cardf.  \"If that doesn\u0027t happen, then I don\u0027t see any alternative other than a general election where Brexit would be the main issue.  \"If there\u0027s an inconclusive result as a result of that general election, well, how then do you resolve the issue without going back to the very same people who took the decision in the first place? At that point you are talking about the potential for a second referendum,\" added the AM for Bridgend.  His remarks came as battle-lines were being drawn ahead of this evening\u0026rsquos informal EU summit in Salzburg when Mrs May will seek to convince her fellow leaders of her Chequers Plan.  But ahead of it, Whitehall sources suggested that she had already rejected the \u0026ldquoimproved offer on the Irish border mooted by Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator.  One insider explained that Mr Barnier had still not dropped his view that Northern Ireland should be treated as a separate customs jurisdiction from the rest of the UK.  \u0026ldquoAny backstop will have to respect our red line that there is not a customs border in the Irish Sea. Mr Barnier has not said anything to suggest that his position has changed on that, said the source.  Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May\u0027s minority administration in Parliament, gave Mr Barnier\u0027s proposals short shrt.  \"It still means a border down the Irish Sea although with dferent kinds of checks,\" said the party\u0027s deputy leader, adding: \u0026ldquoThe fact is that both Theresa May and the Labour Party have said no British prime minister could accept such a concept. It is not just Unionists who object.\"  Meanwhile, Donald Tusk made clear the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit plans needed to be \"reworked\".  Those positive areas included foreign and security policy co-operation, he explained.  But in a blow to Mrs May\u0027s approach, Mr Tusk noted: \"On other issues such as the Irish question or the framework for economic co-operation the UK\u0027s proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.  He added that perhaps there was now \u0026ldquomore hope but there is surely less and less time\".  According to extracts released ahead of Mr Davis\u0027s speech, the former Cabinet minister will say: \"We have been told that the Chequers proposal fulfils what the British people voted for. Well, I am afraid I simply do not buy that.  \"Fty-two per cent of British voters oppose the proposals. Only 18 per cent approve. It is quite remarkable for a government policy to be that unpopular. And, for me, the Chequers plan was always a non-starter.  He noted how in her speeches at Lancaster House and at the Mansion House, the PM had promised to  control over the country\u0026rsquos laws, money and borders. These promises, he stressed, were in the Tory manesto too, yet the Chequers Plan crossed all of those red lines.  \"The EU is often correctly described as having a democratic deficit. But Chequers is devoid of democracy altogether.  \"This is why many of us will shortly be presenting an alternative plan which will outline a more ambitious vision.\"  Mr Davis will go on to say that German companies should not fear a more competitive UK outside the EU but, rather, should \"embrace the opportunity that it will create for German workers, families and businesses large and small\".  \"In the long run, the friendly economic competition between neighbours is massively beneficial.  \"Beneficial for the German companies whose supply chains will be provided with improved components from British factories, beneficial for the consumers of tomorrow, who will enjoy the fruits of a more competitive global economy, and beneficial for the students and entrepreneurs of all Europe,\" the Yorkshire MP will add."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-loses-vote-on-p1-assessments","story":"  Holyrood voted 63 to 61 to pause and review tests for P1 pupils, after complaints from teachers about them being of little value, and parents reporting\u0026nbspchildren in tears.  The SNP government has promoted the standardised national assessments as a key tool to gather information about P1 children\u0026rsquos abilities and to fine tune their teaching.  The vote is not binding on the government, but was a blow to Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos reputation as Education Secretary, and a sign the opposition could embed it in law at a later date.  The decision saw the Greens, Labour and LibDems line up with the Tories while only the SNP voted for a continuation of the computer-based literacy and numeracy tests.  The government defeat came just three months after Mr Swinney was forced to shelve his flagship Education Bill because teachers and other parties would not support the reforms.  The Tory-led manoeuvre followed an often bad-tempered debate in which Mr Swinney and other SNP MSPs accused the Conservatives of rank hypocrisy and political opportunism.  Ruth Davidson\u0026rsquos party had previously advocated standardised tests at P1 and endorsed the government\u0026rsquos use of them in its 2016 Holyrood manesto.  Tory education spokeswoman said her party had been wrong in the past.  \u0026ldquoWe made a mistake about P1, she said, adding her party remained in favour of assessments at P4, P7 and S3.  She told the Education Secretary: \u0026ldquoI think the time has come, because of the evidence that has been piling up over the last two years, to call a halt, reconsider the evidence that is very much before us and evaluate what is the best way of progressing P1 pupils.\"  Mr Swinney said he was \u0026ldquoappalled by the Conservative Party and accused it of \u0026ldquodeceit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Conservatives are playing politics with the education of our children and we will not play along \u0026nbspwith them.  He defended the assessments as an essential part of a good education system, an integral part of effective teaching and learning, and part of \u0026ldquonormal classwork that took little time.  After the vote, other parties demanded the SNP respect the will of parliament, something ministers have repeatedly told Westminster to do on constitutional issues.  Ms Smith said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has voted decisively on this matter, and now the SNP government must act on that. The nationalists have ignored the evidence on this for quite some time, but they can\u0026rsquot afford to any longer.  \u0026ldquoThese tests need to be halted, and the evidence re-examined. The SNP is always talking about how important the Scottish Parliament is and how its will must be respected.  \u0026ldquoThis is the perfect chance for the SNP to do just that.  Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard used a point of order immediately after the vote to demand the government respect the outcome.  He said: \u0026ldquoTeachers told this government that these tests were useless, ministers ignored them. Parents told this government that they do not trust these tests, ministers ignored them.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has now voted to scrap these tests and SNP ministers must not now ignore the will of Parliament. The Government must therefore bring forward immediate plans for how it will respond to this evening\u0026rsquos vote as a matter of urgency.  Green education spokesman Ross Greer said: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos truly shocking about the introduction of these standardised tests is that all the issues highlighted by Greens and others were already well known when the SNP decided to press ahead.  \u0026ldquoMembers of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos own International Council of Education Experts have been at the forefront of these criticisms and ministers still cannot explain why they would ignore their own experts, never mind the voices of a majority of Scotland\u0026rsquos teachers.  \u0026ldquoNow a majority in the Scottish Parliament have joined the calls to scrap these tests for four and five year olds and in a fit of arrogance, the government seems set to ignore our decision.  \u0026ldquoThe concerns that Greens have raised are not limited to the P1 tests. The whole concept of standardised testing does more harm than good to our young people. John Swinney should follow the evidence, accept the will of parliament and scrap the tests immediately.  But SNP MSP Gordon MacDonald said all the opposition parties were \u0026ldquoguilty of the most appalling hypocrisy for siding with the Tories to score political points.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government introduced p1 assessments because they are a tool we need to track kids\u0026rsquo progress and help drive up standards in our schools.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories put standardised P1 assessments in their manesto the majority of Tory-run councils across Scotland already assessed kids from P1 so did Labour and the Lib Dems.  \u0026ldquoLabour and the Lib Dems have sided with the Tories in their political gamesmanship, and sought to prey on the anxieties of parents, just to grab a headline.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos depressing that they all stood willing to do so at the expense of kids\u0026rsquo education.  \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to educating our young people, we should be united in an ambition to drive up standards \u0026ndash not exploiting these issues for political gain.  Sue Palmer, chair of the educational charity Upstart, which promoted a boycott of the assessments, said: \u0026ldquoThe opposition parties made many cogent arguments against the P1 testing and it\u0026rsquos very disappointing that the Scottish government isn\u0026rsquot prepared to listen to them.  \u0026ldquoWe at Upstart Scotland are particularly pleased that one of the closing speeches against the tests mentioned the long-term implications of beginning testing at such an early age in terms of children\u0026rsquos social and emotional development. \u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThere is growing evidence that the decline of self-directed play  coupled with an early focus on teaching specic academic skills is helping to fuel mental health problems among children and young people.    \u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"new-details-of-45m-loan-to-firm-owned-by-fms-adviser","story":"  The Herald has learned the first \u0026pound15m tranche was given to Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde, because it was\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoexperiencing cash flow challenges.  The problem was caused by cost overruns on a \u0026pound97m government contract for two CalMac ferries which have been beset by delays.  Despite the money trouble, records seen by the Herald say the loan was \u0026ldquounsecured, meaning not backed by assets, so  the firm goes broke taxpayers are at the end of the queue.  Ferguson\u0026rsquos is part of the Clyde Blowers empire owned by Monaco-based Jim McColl, who sits on the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers.  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay learned of the cash flow issue in July 2017 and the loan was made last September, but he did not tell Holyrood\u0026rsquos finance committee until seven months later, when he sent a confidential letter referring to the trouble.  Until last week, there was no public record of the loan due to \u0026ldquocommercial confidentiality.  In June, Mr Mackay announced a further \u0026pound30m loan to Ferguson\u0026rsquos to help it \u0026ldquoersy. However records seen by the Herald cast doubt on whether this will ever be repaid.  They show Ferguson\u0026rsquos could convert the loan into shares, which may not hold their value. In addition, the loan would not be repaid in a crisis until Ferguson\u0026rsquos insurance company, HCCI, was paid what it was owed first, as it is the first-ranked creditor.  Tory MSP Jamie Greene said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP have been anything but transparent. It took Derek Mackay over seven months to alert the Finance Committee about the first loan, and there are still huge question marks over the details.  \u0026ldquoHe then changed his story on what the money was for, saying that instead of ersication as first claimed, it was to plug a hole in the ferry contracts.  \u0026ldquoThis deal has been shrouded in secrecy. It\u0026rsquos not good enough for MSPs to go months in the dark - the SNP need to come clean and finally provide all the information surrounding these loans.

Opposition parties argue Mr Swinney must obey the will of parliament, but voting figures of 63 to 61 show how close the decision was.  It was exactly this ergence of opinion that Mr Swinney faced when he addressed an audience of educational professionals at the Scottish Learning Festival in Glasgow on the morning of the vote.  As Storm Ali began to make itself heard around the auditorium of the SEC Centre, the minister would have expected a buffeting on testing as the audience of teachers, heads and other educational professionals were invited to ask questions.  It did not start well. A teacher from a primary school in Galashiels, in the Scottish Borders, said her experience of P1 testing was that they were not working.  \u0026ldquoThey are actually a huge waste of time and money in the way they are being enforced in primary schools, she said.  \u0026ldquoIt is not that I have an objection in principle to the idea of standardised assessments, but what I am seeing in practice is that they don\u0026rsquot work, they are not suitable and my colleagues around me feel exactly the same way.  \u0026ldquoThere is a widespread feeling in Scottish primary schools that they are not fit for purpose.  As Mr Swinney scribbled hastily into his notebook in preparation for a dficult answer, a headteacher from another primary school came to his rescue.  \u0026ldquoWe did not find any level of stress at all and the primary one children actually quite enjoyed taking part, she said.  \u0026ldquoIn terms of the feedback we found them to be extremely helpful. We had a small group of boys that I think we had the wrong measure of when it came down to teacher judgement and it changed how we looked at the support they needed. I think we had underestimated them.  \u0026ldquoThe depth of feedback and the quality of feedback the assessments gave us really helped those children.  Mr Swinney said the contrasting remarks illustrated the ergence of opinion on the benefits of the assessments for five-year-olds.  But what he was at pains to stress to the audience was his belief in the quality of feedback they could provide.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat literally drew an intake of breath from a group of teachers who went through the assessments with me was when they saw the diagnostic information and the way it was presented.  \u0026ldquoIt marshalled some of the strengths and the challenges that young people face and the purpose of standardised assessments is to make sure we are able to learn from what the experience of young people has been, what their challenges are and then to do something about it.  \u0026ldquoThe attainment gap exists when young people come into formal education and the challenge is to try and narrow that as quickly as we possibly can which is why I take the view that P1 assessments are helpful in that respect.  Lurking in the audience to hijack the Education Secretary further on assessments was Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union.  Mr Flanagan, whose union has backed a campaign to encourage parents to opt out of P1 testing, raised the issue of councils who blanket test pupils, rather than allowing inidual teachers to decide - a phenomenon blamed for greater levels of pupil stress.  Mr Flanagan said: \u0026ldquoA set of guidelines was produced, one of which was that teachers would control when these assessments were done.  \u0026ldquoWe know that 25 out of 32 local authorities breached that guideline and instructed teachers when to carry out the assessments.  With a nod to his past as a secondary school English teacher, Mr Flanagan then drew on the words of Hamlet to ask: \u0026ldquoSo in terms of empowerment, there\u0026rsquos the rub. How do we turn rhetoric around professional autonomy into a reality?  Mr Swinney conceded that he did not agree with Mr Flanagan on many things, and also expressed mock surprise the union leader had not taken the opportunity to raise the ongoing issue of pay.  But Mr Flanagan did get a concession from the minister on the need to ensure the guidance was being followed.  Mr Swinney said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot always say this, but I agree with Larry Flanagan. The guidance is clear that teachers should choose at what point it is appropriate to undertake the assessments and that should be respected and I will pursue that in my discussion with local authorities."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-tells-eu-leaders-in-salzburg-chequers-is-only-credible-plan-on-the-table","story":"  As the Prime Minister promoted her compromise proposals over dinner with fellow European leaders at an informal summit in Salzburg, Carwyn Jones, the Welsh First Minister, intervened, arguing that  Holyrood and Cardf were to oppose the final Brexit deal, then there should be a general election, which could eventually lead to another EU referendum.  \"The next step is to see whether a deal can be supported by, for me, parliaments plural: Westminster Edinburgh and Cardf.

When asked  the Scottish Government agreed with Mr Jones\u0026rsquos point about a potential general election, a spokesman for Michael Russell, the Constitutional Affairs Secretary, replied: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has already rejected Brexit and we will make sure that Holyrood has the chance to continue to make its voice heard as the Tories drag us close to the clf edge of a no-deal or a blind Brexit.  \u0026ldquoIt simply should not come down to a choice between those options: the catastrophic or the merely disastrous, he added.  Before the Salzburg dinner began at the Felsenreitschule - the theatre made famous by the von Trapp family in the film The Sound of Music \u0026ndash Mrs May insisted her Brexit blueprint was \"the only credible and negotiable plan on the table that delivers no hard border in Northern Ireland and also delivers on the vote of the British people\".  She stressed: \"If we are going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too.\"  But ahead of the dinner Donald Tusk, the European Council President, made clear the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit plans needed to be \"reworked\".  Announcing a special EU summit in mid-November \u0026ndash which will set the scene for signing any Brexit agreement \u0026ndash Mr Tusk said that while there was \u0026ldquomore hope a deal would be done, there was \u0026ldquoless time in which to do it.  Today, David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary in a speech in Munich will insist the Chequers Plan was \u0026ldquoalways a non-starter and he and his fellow Brexiteers would \u0026ldquoshortly be presenting an alternative plan which will outline a more ambitious vision\".  On her arrival in Austria, the PM welcomed how Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, had recognised his original plan for the Irish border was unworkable and had sought to come up with an \u0026ldquoimproved solution. But Whitehall sources made clear that the private suggestions about Brussels\u0027s new proposals were unacceptable as they still did not drop the view that Northern Ireland could be treated as a separate customs jurisdiction from the rest of the UK.  Mrs May stressed: \u0026ldquoWhat we cannot accept is seeing Northern Ireland carved away from the UK customs territory because, regardless of where the checks would be, what that would mean would be that it would be a challenge to our constitutional and economic integrity.\"  She also decried \u0026ldquoprominent Labour members like the Mayor of London, who were now trying to take Britain \u0026ldquoback to square one with support for a People\u0026rsquos Vote on Brexit.  \"I want to be absolutely clear, this government will never accept a second referendum, declared the PM, adding: \"We held a People\u0027s Vote it was the referendum in 2016.  \u0026ldquoPeople voted to leave the European Union, it is now a matter of trust in politicians that we should deliver on the vote of the British people,\" she added.

The intervention by the former Holyrood Presiding Office came after a People\u0027s Vote report, written by fellow Scottish peer Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who authored Article 50, suggested Mrs May could be forced to concede a second referendum by a vote of MPs or that she could even decide to call one herself.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo  only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online. However, Ms Oag believes it is leading to a surge in the number of abandoned and ill-treated animals.\"It\u0027s not fair on them to be sold alongside kids\u0027 bikes and unused furniture,\" she said. \"Too many people are just not taking responsibility.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country.

While this may not achieve the same speeds as some other options, it may at least offer the benefit of a solution in the nearer future.“I welcome the fact that BT has agreed to investigate the practicalities of installing radio links and hope that this can play a part in helping deliver the improved broadband services that communities across Orkney desperately need to see.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Thursday 20 Sep 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community. We have undertaken to update stakeholders on progress and would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that the A9 at Tain remains a trunk road safety priority.\"In 2015 Transport Scotland\u0026rsquos operating company for the region, Bear, carried out a number of works on the A9 at the Tain north junction, including new signing, extended central hatching and high friction surfacing on the local road approach to the A9.Have you been involved in an accident or near miss in the area?

A farm trailer chassis was found at Avoch.

Edinburgh is set to overtake Glasgow as Scotland\u0026#8217s biggest city within the next 15 years as its population grows, one of the capital\u0026#8217s most senior civic leaders has claimed.                Andrew Kerr, the chief executive of Edinburgh City Council, said the capital was on course to grow its population by 50 per cent by 2050, overtaking Glasgow as early as 2032.            Addressing a housing and construction event, he argued that the “biggest strategic issue” facing Edinburgh was not attracting more people, but managing its growth in a sustainable way.            Mr Kerr said the “stress” on the city’s infrastructure was already apparent during the festival period, describing pavements “packed” with tourists.According to the National Records of Scotland, the population of Edinburgh stood at 513,210 in June last year, while in Glasgow the total number of residents was 621,020.However, its forecasts also suggest that the capital will grow by 7.7 per cent between 2016 and 2026, signicantly faster than Glasgow’s predicted rate of 4 per cent.“We’re arguably the only major growing part of Scotland. That means that by the time we get to 2050, we’ll be half the size we are again,” Mr Kerr told the Built Environment Networking meeting.“We’re a 500,000 person city now, we’ll be 750,000 people. We’ll overtake Glasgow as the largest city in Scotland in 2032 – that’s our best estimate. Glasgow say it’s much longer than that of course.”            Mr Kerr added that demand for housing and office space would continue to grow, admitting that the city was “definitely not building quick enough” and would have to “get our act together”.But he said the capital had a “huge opportunity” to grow along the shore from Granton to Prestonpans, describing this as the “largest underdeveloped waterfront in Europe”.“Edinburgh’s biggest strategic issue is about how it’s going to deal sustainably deal with that growth,” he told the audience.“We’re not a city that needs regeneration, we’re a city that needs to grow sustainably, a city that needs to cope with its own growth and maintain its quality of le, maintain its status in the world.”            Mr Kerr said Edinburgh was able to grow its population through “lots of migration” from abroad and England, but did not mention the possible impact of Brexit.Glasgow City Council declined to comment on Mr Kerr’s remarks.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802756.1537435174!/image/image.jpg","title":"iconic edinburgh detective rebus makes his theatre debut","story":"        Ian Rankin\u0026#8217s most famous character takes centre stage tonight in Birmingham in a play adapted by Rona Munro. Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 50 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802788.1537435985!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon calls for brexit to be delayed","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Meanwhile, a ‘blind’ Brexit will simply kick all of the dficult decisions into the long grass – but with the UK already out of the EU.

The Scottish Government set out plans almost two years ago outlining how, short of remaining in the EU, the best option for Scotland and the whole of the UK would be to remain in the single market and customs union.            “And for two years, the Prime Minister has been promising that there would be a detailed, jointly-agreed position on the future relationship with the EU long before the UK was scheduled to leave.

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.\nFrom photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the 12th July, is a big male known as 014 or “Bigga”.  Next day, the same inidual was identied at 0800hrs heading north through Yell Sound.\nSome of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.\nCommon heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.\nChanging colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.\nFrom the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government.

minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards

challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8633378.1536767392!/image/image.jpg","title":"international sheepdog trial was a tail wagging success","story":"\nThousands of local, national and international visitors descended on Dromore\u0026#8217s Gill Hall Estate for the International Sheepdog Trial 2018\n\n                \nMore than 600 dogs and 300 top handlers from the UK and Ireland went through their paces to secure a place for the competitive three-day event.

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help?

Despite the Troubles shutting down parts of the city, he is determined to play his headline slot in the Harp Bar even  it means playing to an audience of one. It’s here that Terri meets his we Ruth, played by West End star Niamh Perry, and the two try to build their le together, as Terri becomes distracted – all too easily – by trying to passionately promote the latest band to come on the punk scene as he turns promoter for Rudi and The Outcasts.\nIf anyone during Sunday’s afternoon matinee was expecting a leisurely retrospective they were in for a rude awakening as this is a gloriously full-on production of music and song with all-star cast in full, fine voice, all playing instruments and giving it the heap.\nEvery audience member is with our protagonist as he goes across the water, copious copies of seven-inch vinyl under his arm as he tries, most of the time in vain, to try and get snooty English music executives to listen to a band from Derry called The Undertones and their debut song Teenage Kicks – a song so iconic that John Peel did the unthinkable and played it twice on Radio One.\nWith every high comes the inevitable low and we witness how Terri releases the band from the Good Vibrations label for “£500 and a signed copy of a Shangri-Las record”.\nWith a marriage falling apart, mounting debts at the record shop and next to no revenue, a fundraising concert at the Ulster Hall sets the scene for the rousing finale and our lead’s poignant rendition of Sonny Bono’s Laugh At Me.\nA standing ovation gave way to the ‘national anthem’ as the raw opening bars of Teenage Kicks started up and the audience sang every line back to the cast.\nGood Vibrations is a must-see – simple as that. The amount of energy fizzing off the stage is infectious and the cast of ten are exceptional. A transfer to the West End must surely follow.\n\n\nGood Vibrations runs at the Lyric Theatre until Saturday, October 6.

He is genuine in his belief that nobody should be isolated or victimised because of their sexual orientation.\n\n\"While I share his sympathetic outlook, I simply don\u0027t agree that iding people into categories does anyone any good. True equality doesn\u0027t care about labels.\"\n\nThe motion, proposed by Alliance councillors Gavin Walker and Andrew Muir at a corporate affairs committee meeting, passed by six votes to five, and now needs to be ratied at a full council meeting next Wednesday. \n\nMr Graham said that while he too wanted to see \"a unied borough where everyone was respected\", he didn\u0027t believe identity politics was the way to achieve it.\n\nHe also slammed the timing of the vote, which comes less than three months after Arlene Foster attended a Pink News event in Stormont. \n\n\"This is an attempt to drive a wedge between people after Arlene reached out to the LGBT+ community,\" he claimed. \n\nHe said the Alliance Party of today was far removed from its \"past desire\" to bring people together. \n\n\"The party used to be about uniting the community and removing isions but now they are committed to exploiting dferences and bringing about some kind of apartheid based on sexuality,\" he said. \n\nIt is not the first time that Mr Smith has broken ranks with his party on the issue. In 2017 he expressed support for PSNI officers participating in the Belfast Pride parade for the first time. \n\nPosting on Twitter, he also disclosed he had gay friends who had not disclosed their sexuality out of fear of the \"persecution and abuse\" they will face. \n\nThe DUP\u0027s Robert Gibson, who missed the committee due to a family commitment, refused to indicate which way he intended voting. \"I was not at the meeting or part of the debate, so I am not willing to comment,\" he said. Mr Smith could not be reached for comment, and the DUP did not respond to questions.\n\nUlster Unionist Mark Brooks, a gay councillor in Ards and North Down, voted in favour of the proposal.\n\nHe said: \"Councillor Smith is one of two \u0027ersity champions\u0027 on the council and it would have been a surprise  he had voted against the motion given his previous work in that area.\n\n\"DUP leader Arlene Foster made comments about embracing ersity and reaching out, and that\u0027s something I\u0027ve known councillor Smith to do.\n\n\"I can\u0027t comment on the other DUP members who voted against.

We\u0027ll wait and see  Cllr Smith can have any influence on his DUP colleagues in making sure this motion is passed as it should be.\n\n\"Ards Town Hall has been lit up before and there\u0027s no reason why it shouldn\u0027t continue.\"\n\nMr Smith could not be reached for comment last night.\n\nThe DUP also did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month there was controversy when DUP members of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council used a procedural mechanism known as a call-in to stop the Pride flag being flown on council premises.\n\nThe motion at Ards and North Down council called for its corporate affairs committee to back a proposal affirming that lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people be accepted and valued as equal citizens, with Ards Town Hall lit up in rainbow colours to coincide with Pride day.\n\nThe motion was supported at the committee by six councillors - three Ulster Unionist, two Alliance and one DUP - with five DUP councillors voting against.\n\nMr Walker added: \"As the father of a gay man, I know how much value parents place on creating an environment where our children can feel valued and accepted at a time when they need support in understanding their own minds and bodies.\n\n\"It might seem trivial to place store on the physical act of lighting council buildings in rainbow colours on Pride day, but the message of acceptance that will send out to our LGBT community, their family and their friends will be very powerful.\n\n\"There is nothing more isolating than feeling dferent to everybody around you. And when that is coupled with living in an environment which amplies that dference, then the pressure can be unbearable.\n\n\"As a council we are unable to change the feelings iniduals might have, but we can certainly create an environment of acceptance and love that will give our LGBT brothers and sisters time and space to fulfil their lelong potential.\"\n\nThe motion was presented by Alliance councillor Andrew Muir.\n\nHe said: \"I presented this motion in the hope that we could make a positive dference to the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people living, working or visiting our borough and I\u0027m delighted to have secured backing of the relevant council committee in affirming that LGBT people should be accepted and valued just like everyone else.\"\n\nIn June, DUP leader Arlene Foster made headlines by attending a PinkNews event at Stormont, where she told the LGBT community that she looks at them \"as my neighbours or my fellow citizens\".\n\nMr Muir hopes \"common sense\" will prevail next week.\n\n\"At the Pink News event on June 28 this year DUP leader Arlene Foster stated she wanted to acknowledge the contribution of the LGBT community in Northern Ireland and to recognise the reality of ersity among our citizens.\n\n\"She further recognised that some of our brightest and best in this country are part of the LGBT community. This motion is only a reflection of those words.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp ian paisley survives westminsters first recall petition","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Constituents were also able to put their name to the petition via post.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s Chief Electoral Officer Virginia McVea announced the outcome in Belfast around 1.25am on Thursday morning after a count that commenced at midnight.\n\n“The petition has not been successful,” she said.\n\n\nBREAKING - \n@ianpaisleymp\n has thanked the voters of North Antrim for their \"unwavering support\" after Westminster\u0027s first ever recall petition fell short of the threshold required to unseat him.

Mr Paisley, who was not there in person, was informed by text message.\n\nAfterwards Ms McVea rejected criticism that has been levelled at her by Sinn Fein for only opening three centres where people could sign the petition, when the maximum permitted was 10.\n\nShe said there had been “unprecedented” access afforded, with the longest ever electoral period in the region and voters able to access postal ballots on demand.\n\n“There has never been access to an electoral event like that before,” said told the Press Association.\n\n“And the three designated places were the three hubs within the North Antrim constituency. Legislation allows for one up to a maximum in any constituency of ten across the UK and we decided on three.”\n\nUlster Unionist leader Robin Swann said it was clear there was no public appetite for a by-election.\n\n“I respect that outcome,” he said.\n\n\nBREAKING. \n@ianpaisleymp\n holds onto his seat...just. Petition falls 444 votes short of the 7543 required to force a by-election in North Antrim.\n— David Young  \nSeptember 20, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“However I would caution Ian Paisley not to see this as some sort of victory or endorsement of his actions in acting as a paid advocate for a foreign government and bringing North Antrim and the House of Commons into disrepute.\n\n“Rather I would urge him to use the time that he has been suspended from Parliament and the DUP, to reflect on the severity of what he has done and the embarrassment he has brought on Northern Ireland. He should demonstrate some humility.”\n\nMr Paisley’s Commons ban has left current Prime Minister Theresa May shorn of one of her 10 DUP MP confidence and supply allies during a period that could witness several crucial Brexit votes.\n\nIt has also given the DUP another headache at a time when the party is under intense scrutiny at public inquiry hearings in Northern Ireland examining its handling of the botched green energy scheme that brought down Stormont powersharing.\n\nAn investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found the cost of the hospitality afforded Mr Paisley and his family may have been “signicantly more” than his £50,000 estimate.\n\nIt found the Sri Lankan holidays included business-class air travel, accommodation at first-class hotels, helicopter trips and visits to tourist attractions for the North Antrim MP and his wider family.\n\nThe trips also included meeting with Sri Lankan governmental figures.\n\nMr Paisley’s threshold for registering such hospitality in 2013 was around £660.\n\nIn March 2014, Mr Paisley wrote to Mr Cameron to lobby against a proposed United Nations resolution setting up an international investigation into alleged human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn the wake of the watchdog report, Mr Paisley apologised for what he described as an “unintentional failure” to declare the holidays.\n\nIn the 2017 general election, Mr Paisley retained his North Antrim seat with a landslide 20,000-plus majority, securing nearly 59% of the vote.\n\nSinn Fein’s North Antrim Assembly member Philip McGuigan said: “Ian Paisley’s party leadership have yet to condemn these actions or to confirm whether or not he still has their support as MP for North Antrim.\n\n“That is a failure of leadership.\n\n“They need to come out of their hiding place and address the very serious issues at the heart of this scandal.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37336383.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/pe_00560532.jpg","title":"hallelujah ian paisley survives recall petition to remain north antrim mp","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Voting ended at 5pm yesterday. Postal votes were also available.\n\nThe DUP is currently investigating the North Antrim MP. When asked about the progress of the investigation, a party spokesman would only say: \"His membership is suspended pending the outcome of the party\u0027s investigation.\" \n\nIn March 2014 Mr Paisley lobbied the then Prime Minister David Cameron against a proposed UN resolution to investigate alleged human rights abuses during Sri Lanka\u0027s civil war without disclosing the holidays.\n\nNorth Antrim Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan yesterday removed a video posted on social media ahead of the petition\u0027s closure. The issue centred on complaints that Mr McGuigan had allegedly commented on the petition\u0027s outcome.\n\n\"I was contacted by the chief electoral officer warning me that the police could be asked to investigate a social media video I posted urging people to exercise their democratic right to sign the recall petition to remove Ian Paisley from office over his role in the Sri Lanka scandal,\" he said.\n\n\"I find it incredible I am being warned about police investigations when I do not believe there was anything in the post that predicted the outcome of the petition. If that is the case, are the bookmakers taking bets or the political pundits offering opinions also going to receive similar calls?\" \n\nVirginia McVea said: \"It is not up to this office to prosecute and I advised him of that and of the law in regard to the petition of recall process. The petition of recall legislation makes it a criminal offence to forecast the result. \n\n\"This is new legislation for everyone and I wanted to let Mr McGuigan know, and I understand he has taken the decision to remove the tweet.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"almost 30 of ryanair shareholders vote against","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We both need to find a compromise.”\n\nThe Netherlands’ Mark Rutte said: “As long as there is no deal, there is the risk of ‘no-deal’.”\n\nThe Prime Minister set out her plans over dinner with her EU counterparts on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nTheresa May in conversation with Luxembourg’s Xavier Bettel in Salzburg \n\n\n\n\nEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the presentation was “interesting”, adding: “It was polite, it was not aggressive, she was doing her job.”\n\nMrs May said Chequers was “the only credible and negotiable plan on the table that delivers no hard border in Northern Ireland and also delivers on the vote of the British people”.\n\nShe added: “If we are going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position, too.”\n\nUK Government sources revealed that Mrs May used Wednesday night’s dinner to acknowledge the dficulties and that she had “never pretended Brexit would be easy or simple”.\n,0 1px 10px 0 rgba margin: 1px max-width:658px min-width:326px padding:0 width:99.375% width:-webkit-calc width:calc\"\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\" fill=\"#000000\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n View this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n \n\n  translateY\"\n\n  translateX translateY width: 12.5px flex-grow: 0 margin-right: 14px margin-left: 2px\"\n\n  translateY\"\n\n\n\n \n\n  translateY rotate\"\n\n\n\n \"\n\n \"\n\n  translateX\"\n\n\n\n\n \n \nA piece of cake, perhaps?

If that’s the choice, Article 50 should be extended to allow all alternative options for Scotland and UK to be considered. \nhttps:t.co/6TLOJjKgTw\n\n— Nicola Sturgeon  \nSeptember 20, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister’s domestic dficulties over Brexit also continued, with criticism from a senior Tory and a call from Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to delay the UK’s departure from the EU.\n\nSir Mike Penning, a former defence minister who voted Leave before backing Mrs May for the party leadership, told the  she had treated Tory MPs “like children who belong on the naughty step”.\n\nThe former soldier told the paper he was joining the hardline Brexiteer European Research Group , saying: “I’ve come to the conclusion that this ‘put up, shut up’ attitude of the Prime Minister’s – ‘it’s Chequers or nothing, you do as you’re told or else’ – is a massive insult, not only to my colleagues but also to the voters.\n\n“She is playing a game of Russian Roulette with the country which is frankly an insult to the referendum result and all those people who voted, no matter how they voted.”\n\nMs Sturgeon has written to opposition leaders at Westminster arguing that  the UK fails to agree a deal with the EU, the timetable for talks must be extended.\n\n“If the choice we face is between no deal and no detail, then an extension to the Article 50 negotiation period must be on the table as the only way to avoid an economic clf edge, and allow all alternative options to be considered,” she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"here are all the british things that confuse the heck out of americans","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The drainage work was completed recently, but the road is to be closed again between September 17 and 28 from 9am to 4.30pm daily. It will be open at weekends.\n\nLocal councillor Dermot Curran has expressed concern that motorists and visitors to the area face more disruption and believes the resurfacing work should have been completed during the recent road closures.\n\nHe plans to contact the Department for Infrastructure to ensure the resurfacing work can be completed as soon as possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main road linking Downpatrick and Ardglass carries a high volume of traffic, with a lot of this associated with the village\u0026rsquos fishing industry. These road closures are disruptive and I am disappointed the drainage upgrade and resurfacing work was not completed at the same time, continued Cllr Curran.\n\n\u0026ldquoI am fully supportive of the much-needed investment along this particular route, but feel the timing of the work to minimise road closures and disruption could have been handled better.\n\nAlso this week, Cllr Curran has revealed a similar situation has arisen on the Strangford side of Ardglass where a road was closed recently as part of planned improvements.\n\nA section of the road linking the village with Chapeltown was closed in mid-July to upgrade drainage systems and is now closed again. Resurfacing work is also proposed but there is no confirmation when this will start.\n\nCllr Curran added: \u0026ldquoAll road improvement work across the district is welcome and roads officials deserve praise for their commitment to address routes which require investment. I just sometimes think that the execution of the schemes could be better to minimise disruption.\n\n\u0026ldquoFor example, the closure of the Chapeltown Road which links Ardglass with Strangford will be in operation when children  to school for the new term.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Championships getting serious  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO remain on target for a magical seven-in-a-row as the race for the Down Senior Football Championship crown starts to intensy.\n\nPaul McIver\u0026rsquos record-breakers saw off Downpatrjck on a score of 2-14 to 0-10 in Newcastle on Saturday evening and now await the draw to see who they will meet in the semi-finals.\n\nThe draw was to have been made on Monday night following the clash between Loughinisland and Warrenpoint, but as that finished level at 0-9 apiece, the draw will now take place in St Malachy\u0026rsquos Park, Castlewellan, after Saturday\u0026rsquos replay.\n\nDownpatrick were expected to push Kilcoo all the way in their quarter-final, but the threat never materialised.\n\nKilcoo had just too know how for Downpatrick and second half goals from Ceilum Doherty and a ing Ryan Johnston put the issue out of the RGU\u0026rsquos reach.\n\nJoining Kilcoo in the semi-finals are Mayobridge and Burren with the fourth place waiting on the outcome of the Loughinisland v Warrenpoint replay.\n\nMayobridge were taken to the wire by Clonduff in their quarter-final tie and only emerged 2-16 to 2-15 winners after a mighty Clonduff fightback just fell short.\n\nBurren had their hands full against Castlewellan on Sunday night, but they were able to spring Donal O\u0026rsquoHare from the bench and his contribution of three points at a crucial stage of the game proved decisive \u0026mdash Burren scraping home 0-10 to 0-7.\n\nCoincidentally, despite the fact that the current system used for the SFC and IFC has been heavily criticised, the top four teams in Division 1 of the ACFL \u0026mdash should Warrenpoint go through \u0026mdash are all in the last four.\n\nIt is a similar case in the IFC with Bredagh, Liatroim and Darragh Cross \u0026mdash who were all expected to reach this stage of the competition \u0026mdash joining Division 3 leaders Saul in the semi-finals.\n\nThe IFC draw was made in Monday night and pits Darragh Cross against East Down rivals Liatroim with Saul clashing with Bredagh in another all East Down derby.\n\nDarragh were extremely impressive in their 2-8 to 0-6 demolition of Drumgath in Kilcoo on Monday night, while Liatroim enjoyed a 2-17 to 0-12 win over Tullylish.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

As the two rings from Bright dfer little from each other in date, it is assumed they were lost or deposited together at the same time.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are of interest in illustrating the range of finger rings being worn in east Ulster in the late middle ages and might have been made locally or imported.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe ruins of Bright Castle, believed to have been built between the 15th and 16th century, are close by and may have been built on an earlier settlement.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

ago has gone on public display in Co Londonderry.\n\n                \nThe historical item, on loan to the Orange Heritage Centre in Limavady, contains the words of the monarch to Parliament at Whitehall in 1689, ahead of the Battle of the Boyne a year later.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe artefact is the latest signicant addition to the developing collection at the north-west facility, which already includes stirrups belonging to King William, and other objects from the period.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn his address, King William states: “The only reason that induced me to undergo so great an undertaking, was, that I saw the laws and liberties of these Kingdoms overturned, and the Protestant religion in eminent danger and seeing you are here so many Noblemen and Gentlemen, I have called you together, that I may have your advice, what is to be done for securing the Protestant religion, and restoring your laws and liberties, according to my declaration.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOrange historian and curator of the Museum of Orange Heritage, Dr Jonathan Mattison, explained it was through such speeches during the Glorious Revolution, King William outlined his rationale for accepting the invitation to take the throne of the British Isles.\n\nHe said: “Despite assurance that he would be received with overwhelming support, William was determined to ensure that his arrival was not seen as the supplanting of a ‘homegrown’ monarch with a ‘foreign’ king. \n\n“As a consequence, he and his we Mary embarked on a signicant propaganda campaign through the press and other publications, to explain their motives and, above all, emphasising that they were coming to defend the civil and religious liberties of the population.”\n\nMr Mattison maintains the new joint monarchy continued to “curry favour” with the establishment.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The item on loan to Limavady highlights one of those initiatives, as William III demonstrated his credentials to leading political representatives from Scotland. This was important as the Stuarts had a signicant power base in Scotland, a support that would see the creation of a Jacobite Highland army as the dethroned James attempted to retake his throne.\n\n“At this stage many of the political elites are trying to ensure that the transition from King James II to the joint monarchy under William III and Mary II is as smooth as possible – thus averting a civil war. \n\n“Such political horse trading and reassurance would work in England, but warfare soon broke out across Ireland and Scotland.”\n\nBoyd Douglas, trustee, said: “We are proud at Limavady Orange Heritage Centre to add to our growing collection with this excellent item from the Williamite period.  This item has been kindly loaned to us and we thank the owner of this item at this time for placing this item with us.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nLimavady heritage centre is open to the public on Wednesday and Saturday from 10am to 3pm.
