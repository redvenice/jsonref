I thus came top of the class. And bottom. But not in the middle. Bad place to be, the centre.Philip Hammond, Chancellor, was not in his usual place alongside Mrs May. Perhaps he was busy. Or perhaps he was keen not to have to answer an urgent question on Government Brexit forecasts which was scheduled to follow PMQs. That task was entrusted to another Treasury minister, Mel Stride, who is regarded as more reliably pro-May than Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss (also absent). Mr Corbyn made some light hay of Mr Hammond not being there.Mrs May’s efforts to win her backbenchers’ support for her Brexit deal bore little evident fruit. Douglas Ross, a new chap from Moray, was worried about fishing rights. Anne-Marie Trevelyan (Con, Berwick-on-Tweed) said we’d be better off spending the 39 billion pound orce payment on ‘a clean, global Brexit’.    Jeremy Corbyn fought back over the break from the European Union in Parliament           Corbyn said Mrs May\u0027s deal was the best available for Brexit - because it was the only one being put on the tableSir David Amess (Con, Southend W), a Brexiteer but no troublemaker, was unexpectedly withering, saying her deal was the work of ‘largely unelected people and has a distinct remain flavour’.Mrs May somehow kept her temper. Her equanimity is, in itself, striking. ‘He might not be surprised if I do not quite share that analysis,’ she murmured. Sir Desmond Swayne (Con, New Forest W) may be a vigorous Brexiteer but he is also a Christian and he took pity, so asked her about religious intolerance in the Holy Land and a coming visit by the Patriach of Jerusalem.If Mrs May spoke with rare feeling about persecution, that was perhaps not surprising.On the front bench alongside her? Quite a few 2nd XI figures.

It will be published in September 2019.“Dear Readers,” wrote Atwood in a press release announcing the book on Wednesday. “Everything you’ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in.”The Handmaid’s Tale follows one woman’s struggle to survive in a dystopian future America, renamed Gilead, where women possess few rights, are used as breeding vessels and are not allowed to read or write. The novel was first published in 1985, and quickly recognised as a modern classic.It has sold more than eight million copies in English and has gained a new readership in recent years, because of its perceived relevance amid global discussions of sexual harassment, abortion rights and the rise of populist politicians such as Donald Trump. The critical success of the 2017 television adaptation, starring Elisabeth Moss in the lead role of Offred has also helped extend the book’s audience.The Testaments will be set 15 years after Offred’s final scene in The Handmaid’s Tale and narrated by three female characters. It will not be connected to the television version, which has extended beyond Atwood’s 1985 novel to continue Offred’s story.The novel ends enigmatically, with Offred being placed in a van that will possibly deliver her to freedom outside Gilead. An epilogue is narrated by an professor delivering a lecture about the authenticity of Offred’s story in the year 2195, based on cassette tapes he discovered in Maine.“As a society, we’ve never needed Margaret Atwood more,” said Becky Hardie, deputy publishing director at Chatto \u0026amp Windus. “The moment the van door slams on Offred’s future at the end of The Handmaid’s Tale is one of the most brilliantly ambiguous endings in literature. I cannot wait to find out what’s been going on in Atwood’s Gilead ­– and what that might tell us about our own times.”Atwood has previously teased a sequel, most recently in an audiobook adaptation for Audible. At the end of the epilogue, she added a Q\u0026ampA session that ended with the lecturer saying: “I hope to be able to present the results of our further Gileadian investigations to you at some future date.”“I am in consultation with the professor, but he is being very cagey about this,” Atwood told Canadian website the Loop at the time. “He evidently doesn’t want to make any promises before he has finished authenticating his new discoveries.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3951b462769708448f0074461308e2a762e0254b/0_624_3819_2292/master/3819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6593e0b1ba7f295517146f12a324abf0","title":"sally rooneys normal people named waterstones book of the year","story":"Bookseller praises word-of-mouth hit as ‘cementing her reputation as the voice of her generation’In a win for literary fiction amid declining sales, Sally Rooney’s novel Normal People has been named Waterstones book of the year.Rooney’s second novel, which follows two young people falling in love in post-Celtic Tiger Ireland, has sold just under 41,000 copies in hardback in the UK since it was released in August – five times the hardback sales of her 2017 debut, Conversations With Friends. At 27, Rooney is the now the youngest winner of the award, which goes to the title staff at the UK’s biggest bookshop chain most enjoy recommending. “I’d like to thank the booksellers at Waterstones for supporting this novel so wholeheartedly,” said Rooney. “In the production of books, the work of booksellers – as well as delivery drivers, paper-mill workers, typesetters, proof readers, and many more – is just as important, really, as the work of writers. So I would like to extend my thanks, if I can, to everyone whose hard work has been so vital to the writing and publication of this novel. I am very touched by the honour.”The book of the year is the latest in a stream of awards for Normal People, which received almost universal critical acclaim upon its release. Longlisted for the Man Booker prize, the book won novel of the year at the An Post Irish book awards on Tuesday night and has also been shortlisted for the Costa novel of the year, announced in January.Bea Carvahlo, fiction buyer for Waterstones, said the reader response to Normal People had been astonishing. “As well as the universal praise, it has been a huge word-of-mouth hit,” she said, citing examples of customers returning to buy multiple copies as gifts. “Normal People cemented Sally Rooney’s reputation as the voice of her generation and one of the most exciting novelists around today. Its success is testament to the health of literary fiction and demonstrates that there is still significant appetite for excellent storytelling.”The award, established in 2012, tends to go to books that are already bestsellers in the run-up to Christmas. It has previously been won by the late American author John Williams for his posthumous hit Stoner, the cookbook Polpo by Russell Norman, and last year’s choice, Philip Pullman’s La Belle Sauvage.James Daunt, Waterstones managing director, said Rooney’s win was a sign of the healthy state of literary fiction, which has seen sales plummet over the last decade. “We are delighted to name it our book of the year,” he said.Also up for the title were journalist Dolly Alderton’s debut memoir Everything I Know About Love, Isabel Hardman’s Westminster study Why We Get the Wrong Politicians, Madeline Miller’s novel Circe, nature poetry collection I Am the Seed That Grew the Tree, colourised photography book The Colour of Time, legal exposé The Secret Barrister and Henry Eliot’s publishing history The Penguin Classics Book."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc4cd54df61d1a9505d5017b1bb9b7c30978b67b/0_77_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48adae54bb09ee2ed38b1c7b46c22c55","title":"ikea profits revamp takes toll","story":"Ikea’s profits have fallen by more than a third as the world’s biggest furnishing retailer invests in improving its online business and tests smaller city-centre stores.During the year, the group invested €2.8bn, the majority of which funded 14 new distribution centres to cater for online business. It also bought windfarms in Finland and Portugal and forests in Latvia and the US, as part of its sustainability efforts, and acquired the odd-job gig economy app TaskRabbit.The fall in profits came after Ikea said last week it was cutting 7,500 office jobs worldwide, including 350 in the UK, to focus on improving its online operation and city-centre format.The Swedish group, which employs 160,000 people, said the jobs would go over the next couple of years, and would mainly affect administrative staff in central support functions across the 30 countries where it operates.Juvencio Maeztu, the deputy chief executive and chief financial officer of Ingka, said: “During the year we have increased our efforts and investments to start to transform our business. While this has had an impact on our results, it is a conscious decision for us to start a three-year period to transform our business and be better equipped for the next 75 years. Our financial strength enables us to invest over the long term, and with purpose, in our own future.”Ikea stores worldwide are owned by 11 franchisees, of which Ingka is the biggest with 367 stores. Franchisees pay a proportion of annual sales to the brand owner, Inter Ikea.Ikea plans to open a city-centre store in Paris next summer after launching similar outlets in London, Stockholm and Madrid this year.

She will also know that the two-fifths of dissenters, assuming they hang around, will want her out if the super-sized serving of noodles causes medium-term indigestion.The buyer will hope that, once the hefty 13-for-nine £315m rights issue has cleared, the market will warm to the pitch that Wagamama will reinvigorate a tired-looking portfolio currently led by Frankie \u0026amp Benny’s and Garfunkel’s.Maybe, but it remains hard to ignore the key statistics of this purchase. The price represents 13 times top-line earnings, which is a very high ratio for an established restaurant format. On a per-leasehold basis, broker Langton Capital reckons £4m a pop is the most ever paid for a chain of any size in the UK. On any normal yardstick, this deal is plain expensive.By rights, it should be the private equity sellers giving thanks to the three-fifths of Restaurant Group’s shareholders who gave the thumbs-up. Duke Street reckons it has a made a tidy 3.4 times return on its money during seven years of owning Wagamama. It has grown the chain impressively – but also got supremely lucky in finding such a gung-ho buyer in the current nervous climate.What’s happened in the interim, of course, is that the Italian government and Brussels are at loggerheads over the country’s spending plans. The bond market is spooked by a confrontation between a populist (and currently popular) government and a European commission that is threatening to impose fines for breaches of budget rules. One consequence is that Italian banks are having to pay more for their money.At least Britain’s banks can withstand a Brexit storm, even the dramatic disorderly no-deal scenario outlined by the Bank of England. They all passed their annual stress tests.Do not, however, expect international investors suddenly to fall in love with UK banks. Being resilient is not the same as prospering.

There were already some lovely tributes to him online, praising his determination to keep fighting against inequality and his desire that younger generations understand the horrors of war.I struck up a friendship with Harry back in 2013, when I read something he’d written for The New Left project about his time serving in the second world war and was moved to try to find him. The editor of the site kindly gave me his email and I dashed off a quick message asking him if he’d let us run the piece on the . To my surprise, he replied almost instantly, giving me permission and striking up a conversation. The piece is worth reading again, a passionate plea to the modern world to remember the ideals that those who endured the trauma of war pinned their hopes on upon coming home. “The Green and Pleasant land was for everyone after the war because we had bled for it and died for it. We demanded a truly democratic society where merit was rewarded and no one would be left behind because of poverty, poor health or an inadequate education.”We continued to email across continents – Harry in Canada, me in London. He was funny and kind to me when I was going through a difficult time in my life, and was always up for writing a piece, and filed on deadline – an editor’s dream! I think his two most-read pieces were probably his explanation for why he would no longer wear a poppy on Remembrance Day, and his eulogy to the NHS. People marvelled at the progressive and forthright views of this nonagenarian, railing against injustice and the creep of rightwing ideology, all at a time in life when most of his peers were either well into their retirement or dead.But my favourite piece he wrote for the  was about his son Peter’s struggle with schizophrenia. Mental illness is shrouded in stigma, and even now people often shrink from those with a diagnosis like the one his son was unlucky enough to be given, but Harry described tackling it with warmth and understanding and, above all, with love. Having dealt with mental health problems myself, his openness and acceptance moved me to tears as I read his copy. It was another example of his ability to learn and grow at any age, not fossilise and retreat into ourselves, as so many of us do. His son later died, another huge loss in Harry’s life. He suffered many tragedies in his long life, starting when his sister Marion died in a workhouse infirmary. He spoke of his grief bluntly, but never lost his optimism about the world, despite what he had experienced – a feat many of us could not manage.His articles in the  grabbed the attention of a publishing house, and he was commissioned to write a book about his life and his fury that the UK was returning to the inequalities of his childhood. Harry’s Last Stand came out in 2014, his first book published when he was a sprightly 92. He was flown over from Canada for the launch, which the publisher held, rather incongrously, at the Garrick club in London – a private members’ establishment for the elite. I was invited to dinner there, my first meeting with him after more than a year of communication. When I arrived, I was ushered over to meet him, a small man with oversized glasses and a flat cap on, drinking a shandy (I assume the barman at the Garrick has since recovered from the shock). He hugged me to him, and sat me next to him over dinner, where he held my hand and thanked me for ushering in this new phase of his life. Sometimes writers are a disappointment in real life, but Harry was better. He knew of what he spoke, read everything he could, stayed up to date with the modern world, took no nonsense.While in the UK, he was hugely in demand, defending the NHS at the Labour party conference, touring the country with his book, appearing on the news, debating with Owen Jones. He kept me up to date with his whereabouts – at a B\u0026ampB in Yorkshire, at a hotel in Wales. He had naps, but carried out a packed schedule, energised by the message he wanted to convey, and thrilled that people were listening.On a later trip to London, I took him to the pub with my friend Ollie, a photographer who has an interest in capturing veterans. After his usual shandy, we took him outside for an impromptu photoshoot, the results of which you can see above. He was game, as usual, and tickled that someone wanted to snap him, joking about his best side.I left the  a few years ago, but Harry kept on writing. His last piece for the paper was in September 2017, about Britain’s housing crisis. His unique skill came in combining tales from his past with warnings about our society’s future. He was not nostalgic for the prewar days, but keen to talk of the deprivation, the awful inequality, the lack of a safety net for those most in need of one. Having lived through those times, he was well equipped to speak about what he saw as a return to those days – creeping privatisation, the selling-off of the NHS, the growing space between the ultra rich and everyone else. He urged us to strengthen the social safety nets, to band together in communities, to demand more from our leaders than cuts, austerity and policies led by fear.His popularity was, in part, because his wisdom came from his long life. We have all lost something in his passing: a link to a time that most of us cannot imagine and have no desire to. For me, personally, I’ve lost a man who sort of felt like family to me in some way. My grandfathers both died some years back, and Harry felt like an wonderful last-minute gift. An unfailingly kind man, who lived his values and grabbed his chance at a second act with both hands until the very end. We should remember his lessons, and be thankful we had the chance to hear them. I shall miss him very much.• Bella Mackie is a freelance journalist and author of Jog On, a book about running and mental health"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a67ddfaadc772721ebee08d0f38f841bf8de8330/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=100aee9ef14e7de53b8b8b103661b71c","title":"john mcdonnell plan transform britain labour brexit","story":"You can’t doubt the dedication of the crowd packing out this London concert hall on a Tuesday night. For an audience with John McDonnell, they have braved all the muck that a November evening can throw at them. They line up at the end for selfies and book signings. And the very mention of rent controls is greeted with an ovation.Yet they’re here with good reason. Interviewing the shadow chancellor for this  Live event, it strikes me that what he says and does over the next few weeks matters more for him and for the rest of the country than at any time during his previous 40 years in politics.In just a few days, MPs vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal. Beyond that lies the very real prospect of a general election, or even a full-blown constitutional crisis. And in the background hangs a big question: how radical can any Labour government be? Given the keys to No 11, how far can McDonnell change Britain?Because, rest assured, that is his aim. Asked about plans for the first 100 days of a Labour government, McDonnell says they must be “transformational”. He promises an immediate increase in the minimum wage, “putting money into people’s pockets”, and a restoration of rights to trade unions. Even without an election, Jeremy Corbyn is already petitioning May to meet senior civil servants about how to turn Labour policies into law. Meanwhile, each shadow frontbencher is going back through the 2017 manifesto and writing out their own department’s “implementation manual”.What about those much‑debated plans for nationalisation? McDonnell wants water and rail to be the first two industries taken back from the private sector. Energy will take longer, partly because he wants to foster more local energy companies, as is common across much of Europe.McDonnell has been talking for a only few minutes, and already he has outlined enough work to last any government a decade. Such expansiveness is remarkable for anyone around my age, whose political memory consists in large part of Labour leaders from Neil Kinnock onwards starting with modest, focus-grouped pledges and getting more cautious the closer they get to a poll. Not McDonnell, who now has a plan to recast the British economy in three parts.First there is what Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, calls “the most radical tax-and-spend plans placed before the electorate by one of the main parties in more than 70 years”. Even they, mind, don’t add up to a reversal of the cuts we’ve seen since 2010. Then Labour proposes re‑engineering the financial system so that it does much more than simply lend money to homebuyers. The biggest and toughest job of all is changing the rules by which markets and businesses are run, such as putting workers on company boards and changing how executive pay is set.The obstacles to McDonnell’s plans are well laid out in a new book he himself has edited. Called Economics for the Many, this varied anthology of ideas and arguments includes a chapter by Simon Wren-Lewis. The Oxford professor writes: “If Brexit goes ahead and we leave the single market, the UK is likely to remain a depressed economy with low interest rates, and highly vulnerable to negative shocks. As if that were not bad enough, Labour will also face a media that seems incapable of thinking of fiscal policy as anything more than just good housekeeping, and which has not understood how large a mistake austerity was.”The word mistake might more aptly be substituted with “crime”, but as a summary this is hard to beat. McDonnell’s response is interesting: it is to signal a big change in Labour’s thinking on Brexit. “I’ve been working through the various scenarios,” says one of the most determined strategists in British politics. First, MPs will chuck out May’s deal, but probably set her the task of tweaking it. But even that, he thinks, will lose a second vote. Throughout, Labour will carry on calling for an immediate general election but McDonnell admits the parliamentary maths means this probably won’t happen. The hard-Brexiteers hate May’s treaty but they know turfing her out will be tantamount to their own career suicide. The DUP might similarly decide to prop her up. At which point, the shadow chancellor says, a people’s vote “might be an option we seize upon”.The ballot paper for any second referendum would have two choices: May’s deal and remain. In a 180-degree turn from the position he took during Labour’s party conference in September, McDonnell would not include an option for no deal “because of the damage” it would cause the economy. And yes, he would be a remainer. Labour, he says, is a European party.No wonder Theresa May pounced on these remarks in prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, because this could mark a turning point in the politics of Brexit. After years of what Labour insiders call “constructive ambiguity” on where they stand on leaving the European Union – the hasty call for article 50, the six tests that spell fudge – McDonnell accepts that “we’re running out of road” and that the party will have to jump one way or another. There is still some fantasising about Labour drawing up its own withdrawal agreement, but the sense I take away from Tuesday evening is the shadow chancellor has settled on a plan B – to be seen to exhaust all the options before reaching the destination of a second referendum, which he now describes to the BBC as “inevitable”.Two things stand out about Labour’s present thinking on the economy. The first is how many of the problems McDonnell wants to address have been tackled before by Labour governments. Harold Wilson’s government had plans for public investment institutions and wanted to create a department of economic affairs to rival the Treasury. It failed, and not just because George Brown wasn’t up to the job. A quarter of a century ago, Tony Blair latched on to Will Hutton’s The State We’re In, with its proposals to democratise the economy – until he dropped it for the candyfloss of the Third Way.The civil society that helped previous generations of Labour politicians generate those ideas is much thinner now. The Greater London Council, in which McDonnell began his career in politics, was once an incubator of alternative political ideas. But Margaret Thatcher did for the council and flogged off its base, County Hall. A similar decline and shrinking has befallen many of the other institutions that could foster alternative visions of society, from the unions to even the BBC. All of which means that, if McDonnell and his colleagues are to try to repair the damage that has been done to this country by austerity, and before that by the Thatcherite thugs, they will need more than the Labour party. They will need a full-blown social movement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f930e2f6c0b1b1870b6501c7fcc9fd61dd2a44e6/0_162_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28b608521d518b99b48819df3d0a88bb","title":"theresa may support brexit deal","story":"Theresa May’s Brexit tour of Britain – she was in Scotland today promoting her EU deal – speaks simultaneously to her strengths and her weaknesses as a politician. The strengths are often too lightly dismissed, and not just by those who primly disdain her as simply an evil Tory. But it is May’s judgmental weaknesses that still shape the political landscape as she battles to carve out a Commons majority on 11 December.No one I have spoken to at Westminster this week believes May will get her deal through next month. But what a sleepless effort she is putting into overturning the odds. Selling her dog’s dinner of a deal, and in the face of daunting parliamentary arithmetic, May’s determination to succeed appears quixotic, going on suicidal. Yet her resilience in the face of a relentless schedule of Commons grillings, government meetings, speeches and summitry – her trips this week to Brussels, Belfast, Builth Wells and Glasgow are now followed by the sapping 14-hour flights to and from the G20 summit in Argentina – is awesome.What is more, her efforts are being noticed and approved of by the public. Last Thursday there was a 13-point opinion poll swing over only seven days in May’s favour as the best prime minister for Britain. And today a survey reported in the Daily Mail pointed to a similar shift of opinion in favour of her Brexit deal. Don’t get this wrong: the country remains deeply ided. But there is momentum in favour of May’s deal across the board – including among Labour and remain voters.Here is a prime minister doing her best to give politics a good name. The Tory party is luckier to have her than they know. Yet there is something seriously disjunctive about barnstorming around the country when the 649 voters who will shape the country’s fate are all across the road in Westminster. Watching May’s one-woman attempt to bring order and compromise out of the chaos of which she is in so many ways the author, it is hard not to conclude: c’est magnifique, but it’s not very good politics.Maybe we’re all wrong. Maybe May’s efforts to rally the public will create pressure over the next two weeks to push enough MPs into her lobby. But she would have had a far easier time if throughout the Brexit process she had reached out more thoughtfully to the majority of MPs, who would – and possibly still want to – support a workable compromise.Right now, though, it is defeat that looms for May. The consequences could be seismic. I bumped into a historically minded old colleague this week who immediately said, with a mix of excitement and horror: “It’s 1846 all over again. It’s 1886. It’s 1922. It’s one of those moments when everything is recast.”My friend may well be right. But in some ways May’s problem goes beyond those that were faced by Peel, Gladstone or Lloyd George. May’s problem is not simply that extricating Britain from the EU is itself hellishly difficult after 45 years of convergence. It’s that the crisis through which she is attempting to navigate is ensnared in a constitutional tangle that those earlier leaders never had to face – the conflict between referendums and representative democracy.Right from the start May seemed to intuit the size of the political trap that was created by a referendum vote to support an outcome – Brexit – that most MPs and all the main parties opposed. The wish to “parliamentarise” the referendum vote of 2016 lay behind her decision to call the 2017 general election. She hoped she could win a mandate to require Tory remainer MPs to back her version of Brexit.If she had won, then referendum and parliament might have been aligned, albeit in a bad Brexit cause. Her failure in the election did not just throw away the Tory majority and empower the backbenches and minor parties. It also left the conflict between referendums and parliamentary government fundamentally unresolved.As a result, all of the issues that were launched by the 2016 Brexit verdict have remained unresolved too. The referendum said leave. But it never said what it wanted leave to mean, beyond exiting the EU. It was silent on the terms of withdrawal and the future relationship. It never said what should happen if the terms were unsatisfactory or if they split the country. It never said what should happen if some of the component parts of the UK voted differently from the majority. It made no provision for second thoughts or for the kind of citizens’ assembly that helped Ireland to find a solidly based way through its recent abortion referendum.The 2017 election also meant that May had to change her approach to Brexit. She no longer had the votes in parliament or the authority over her party to deliver the hard deal she had proposed in October 2016. She needed to take a fresh approach but was culpably slow to learn this lesson, and it is why she is staring defeat in the face today. Her Brexit tour is thus a kind of general election campaign without the public vote.May has never been a good collegiate politician with other parties. As home secretary during the coalition frombetween 2010 and 2015 she simply pretended the Liberal Democrats did not exist. After June 2017 she was too damaged to take Brexit out of the hands of the Tory nationalists and to explore a version that other parties, and Labour backbenchers in particular, might have been persuaded to support. She stood up to the nationalists only towards the very end of the negotiation process, forcing several to resign but coming back with a deal that offends committed leavers and remainers alike.None of this has been easy in a hung parliament, with the two major parties both deeply split. None of it is simple in a political culture relentlessly undermined by an overmighty and not very good media. Attempting it is hard at a time when the digital revolution has usurped the earlier influence of now much diminished institutions, communities and interest groups that once helped to make parliament, for all its imperfections, the cornerstone of national decision-making.But it has to be done. The disruption of parliamentary politics by the referendum, combined with May’s failure to reach out to Labour, has left British politicians in a weak place from which to reassert the authority of representative government. But it is the problem to which Britain and other modern democracies need an answer. It is not just Britain’s relationship with the EU that will be on the line as MPs vote on 11 December. It’s parliamentary democracy too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/288431468da99c0a0042c56db3ef9fec6fe595f6/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b455921b00f918c3e353bb5426009573","title":"the arts have the power to change communities","story":"I worked at the British Film Institute when Jennie Lee was the arts minister (This philistine government is failing the arts, 26 November). We were grateful to her for persuading the Labour government to support the arts relatively generously. But this shouldn’t hide the fact that her view of the arts was a traditional one. When she visited the BFI, she thought its main role was to make films about established art forms. She had no sense that cinema might deserve the same interest as literature or painting. Oddly, the only arts minister I came across who had a sophisticated knowledge of cinema was a Conservative, Grey Gowrie, who on one occasion showed a good knowledge of who Samuel Fuller was.Alan LovellCoventry• I agree with Hannah Jane Parkinson on the state of arts funding and that Jennie Lee proposed the best hope for the arts in 1965. I benefited from this, along with other arts workers, but the funding engine seemed to run out of steam in the mid-70s. A number of theatre directors who worked in this period have said that although we took the arts to the people, in the end the people didn’t come to the arts as much as had been hoped. If this was the case, can anyone explain why? Those of us working to improve arts funding for future generations need to know.David CockayneWarrington, Cheshire• A big thank you to Hannah Jane Parkinson for her eloquent exposure of this government and the arts. As a footnote, may I offer the case of British theatre? Many years ago, it was argued, and won, that every town and city should have a public library. For years, I have tried to argue that the country of Shakespeare should have a theatre in every town and city. Young people should be as familiar with theatre as they are with internet offerings.Theatre companies should be residential in towns and cities so that they are identified as an essential part of the community. Plays should be put on by local people and performed back to back with Shakespeare, Wilde, Stoppard and Caryl Churchill. When researching this years ago, I spoke to cultural spokespeople at the German and Italian embassies in London. The German said (I paraphrase): “Why do you treat your actors they way you do? With us, they are respected and valued, like lawyers, teachers or doctors.” The Italian said anyone in Italy who got on a bike could see live opera.Who’s going to pay for this? The same as libraries and parks, it’s a fundamental component of every civilised British community.Ian FlintoffOxford• Like Paul Barry (Letters, 27 November), Hannah Jane Parkinson’s article brought back memories for me. In 1994, I was commissioned by the North West Arts Board to write an information pack on theatre in education. As the effects of Thatcher’s national curriculum and transferring of funding from local education authorities to schools hit the eight companies I studied, the pack’s purpose was to persuade schools to fund what had been the LEAs’ responsibility. Responses from schools suggested it shouldn’t be too hard. “He’s somebody else – he never listens normally,” said a Liverpool primary teacher, enthralled as her reluctant learner engaged earnestly with the ship’s bosun. “They want to learn, don’t they? It saves so much time and effort when pupils want to learn.”But the most telling response came from a Wigan teenager. “Before I went to see the production I did not like black people.” But “Ian asked us to read what was wrote. It made me sick what white people were calling black people, and when I got out of the production I was shaking with rage. I just can’t write enough to describe how much your production has made me question myself, like have I ever made fun of black people.”Thanks to Thatcher and Conservative policy, few teenagers are likely to have their lives changed so dramatically. Within a year that theatre-in-education company and two others had gone.John AirsLiverpool• David Cameron once made an interesting intervention on the subject of British arts. He said he thought British film-makers should concentrate more on making blockbusters in competition with the Americans. My suspicious mind wondered whether he was irked by the way postwar film-making, from Woodfall and the “kitchen sink” onwards, has often tended towards anti-establishment socio-political dramas. How often have Tory ministers ground their teeth at critical acclaim given to Ken Loach’s films? But, of course, this is what has given British films their unique flavour, just as the Beatles et al did for pop music. Cameron would doubtless have preferred a return to a McCarthyite era, where serious films gave way to light comedies or noir thrillers.But there was an amusing intervention of a different sort from a Tory, John Major, in the 1990s when, trying to surf the Cool Britannia craze, he praised The Full Monty, unaware apparently that this featured a group of workless guys reduced to stripping for a living because Major’s party had destroyed the industrial base of their city.David RedshawGravesend, Kent• Join the debate – email • Read more  letters – click here to visit guletters• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with  readers?

But those concerns are only partly borne out by the Ucas data, which shows students holding unconditional offers were marginally less likely to achieve their predicted grades than their peers with conditional offers.Damian Hinds, the education secretary, said he found the rise in unconditional offers “disturbing” and warned that universities in England could face regulation by the Office for Students over any unjustified use.“This report shows that many students could be distracted from the final year of their schooling, and achieve A-level grades lower than they are capable of. These are effects that we know can have a significant impact on their career,” Hinds said.The use of unconditional offers has ballooned since the government abolished the cap on the number of undergraduates each university in England could recruit, allowing expansion at a time when the number of school leavers was declining.Universities that use unconditional offers said they saw few signs that they affected their students’ efforts before or after arriving on campus.Prof Graham Galbraith, Portsmouth’s vice-chancellor, said: “The Ucas analysis reinforces my belief in the appropriateness of the University of Portsmouth’s own unconditional offer scheme. We have found that applicants to whom we make unconditional offers are more likely to attain their predicted grades than applicants to whom we make conditional offers.”To maintain motivation, Portsmouth also gives students with unconditional offers a £1,000 bursary if they achieve their predicted A-levels.Galbraith said the Ucas data highlighted a serious problem with the unreliability of A-level predictions used for conditional offers. “If 18-year-olds know that their predicted grades are no more accurate than a coin toss, is it any wonder that they report that unconditional offers reduce their stress levels and improve their mental wellbeing?”Ucas estimated that unconditional offers led to 1,015 18-year-olds getting A-levels that were two grades lower than predicted.Prof Chris Husbands, the vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, said his institution made hundreds of unconditional offers, out of the more than 7,000 undergraduates it recruited this year.“We don’t use them to put bums on seats, in the minister’s phrase, we use them to position ourselves at the top end of the attainment range and attract a high calibre of students. These are students who are going to university, and I want them to come here and not to a university down the road,” Husbands said.Sheffield Hallam has carefully followed the performance of its students who accepted unconditional offers, and found no difference in their attainment or later outcomes.The University and College Union said the controversy showed that the UK’s system for university applications needed a radical overhaul.It said: “The time has come for the UK to join the rest of the world and adopt a system of post-qualification admissions, where offers are based on actual achievement rather than estimated potential.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d008f04e3013faf0c4ea1334d38b102764091b7/0_126_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=629924bb8c0e36b0e88d4e9877baf556","title":"tell us was 2018 the year you woke up to climate change","story":"We’d like to know if you changed your opinion on climate change and whether there was a moment that convinced you of its impactThis year has seen more than 200 natural disaster events take place across the world.

We cannot sleepwalk through this health emergency any longer.”The report sets out the impacts of global warming on health in stark terms. ”A rapidly changing climate has dire implications for every aspect of human life, exposing vulnerable populations to extremes of weather, altering patterns of infectious disease, and compromising food security, safe drinking water and clean air,” it said.Nick Watt, the executive director of the Lancet Countdown, said: “These are not things happening in 2050 but are things we are already seeing today. We think of these as the canary in, ironically, the coalmine.”On Tuesday the UN said action to cut carbon emissions must be tripled to avoid catastrophic warming. International climate change negotiations were due to resume on Monday in Poland.The Lancet report said the lack of progress “threatens both human lives and the viability of the national health systems they depend on, with the potential to overwhelm health services”.A survey in the report of leaders of almost 500 global cities found half expected their public health infrastructure to be seriously compromised by climate change, meaning systemic failures such as the shutdown of hospitals. A heatwave in Europe this summer was linked to hundreds of premature deaths in the UK alone. MPs said in July that the UK was “woefully unprepared” for heatwaves.The Lancet report says populations in Europe and the eastern Mediterranean are at higher risk than those in Africa and south-east Asia because of the high proportion of vulnerable and elderly people living in cities.As temperatures rise across the world, the report says 157 million more vulnerable people were subjected to a heatwave in 2017 than in 2000. Hot conditions directly damage health via heatstroke, but dehydration and exacerbation of conditions such as heart disease are also very dangerous. Heat also worsens air pollution and mental health problems.Doctors not involved in the report said it presented convincing evidence. “It is clear that climate change is directly impacting our health,” said Howard Frumkin, head of the Wellcome Trust’s Our Planet, Our Health programme. “All sectors must prioritise action on climate change if we are to significantly reduce the potentially devastating impact on our planet and our health, affecting generations to come.”The Lancet report noted some promising trends, such as the phase-out of coal and the growth of electric cars.Prof Hilary Graham, of the University of York and part of the Lancet Countdown team, said linking health and climate change could help spur further action. “Health is what people feel. It makes a direct connection with their lives and the lives of people they care about like their children and grandchildren.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed53c3d5a97db12ee69ee721c8987a5f2ebc277f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f44caa6c6b643cdc1f1e8a8bfeffea76","title":"guide party dressing men velvet dicky bows mortarboards","story":"Whether you channel Timothée Chalamet in a tux or keep it casual à la Ralph Lauren in jeans, there are plenty of glad rag options on the high street.

Against the odds, the new one was a triumph, with just a couple of the original songs, some ingenious new plot quirks and a whole lot of energy and fun. But now – bafflingly, boringly – there is yet another adaptation, by Warner Brothers and Netflix, a heavier and more cumbersome version directed by Andy Serkis, that master of mo-cap.So we trudge back to the uncanny valley for another bout of ultra-realistic animation. No songs at all now, and not much fun. The new idea is a new transgression, a new interpretation of the law of the jungle, a loyalty crisis between Mowgli and the other animals, which puts the “man village” in front of the camera with some actual non-CGI human actors – making this seem like a superhero origin story.The man village scenes break the spell, muddling the story and making the Indian villagers dramatically equivalent to the animals gives us an ungainly kind of Orientalism. As ever, we are left to ponder the non-Darwinian fact that Mowgli has no greater kinship with the sly monkeys than with all the other monkeys.Shere Khan is voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch Akela by Peter Mullan Bagheera by Christian Bale and a female Kaa by Cate Blanchett – Scarlett Johansson did it last time.

Then, while travelling in the Caribbean, I had a revelation: crisp sweet potato fries that made a virtue of the tuber’s natural sugars to give a deliciously caramelised result. They weren’t trying to be potato chips – which is fortunate, because their strong flavour and dense, creamy texture is never going to fool anyone – but this time, they were just as delicious.Some recipes specify there’s no need to peel, but, though generally a fan of the lazy approach, here I think a little work pays off: the skin makes the fries taste like baked potato wedges rather than chips.Cook’s Illustrated magazine cautions that “the typical sweet potato fry is cut thin, which means too little creamy sweet potato interior”, and I’m inclined to agree: much as I love french fries, the sweet potato has a tendency to dry out if prepared like this. Instead, make a virtue of its dense texture by cutting them into wedges, which will allow the interior to remain fudgy while the exterior crisps up.Sweet potatoes do have a relatively low starch content in comparison with the ordinary kind, but, just as when cooking rice, it’s important to get rid of as much of that as possible before cooking, because it will turn into sugar, which burns at high temperatures – some, such as Rebecca Lindamood of the Foodie With Family blog, reckon that excess starch stops the fries getting crisp – though rinsing, as with rice, should do the trick there’s no need to soak them for hours first.The Joy of Cooking fries its par-boiled potatoes without further ado, but everyone else coats them in some way before cooking.Alice Hart cautions in The New Vegetarian that sweet potatoes should not be seasoned with salt until the last minute: “It will only draw moisture out and make the sweet potato soggy.” Instead, she coats hers in cornflour, cornmeal hot paprika and dried garlic. Jamieoliver has no fear in adding salt, along with sweet smoked paprika and black pepper, while Cook’s Illustrated sticks with a simple paste of cornflour and water, which does indeed cling to the tacky exteriors of their par-boiled fries very effectively.Seasoning alone doesn’t seem to cut the mustard: the jamieoliver wedges are tasty, but soggy rather than crunchy. Having removed excess starch from the potatoes themselves, it’s time to add some back on to the surface to crisp up in the heat. Hart’s mix pleases testers the most: the cornflour provides an even coating, while the cornmeal adds a gritty crunch. Jamieoliver’s smoked paprika is optional, but recommended. As my recipe involves parboiling the potatoes first, it seems wise to salt the water rather than the coating, just in case any moisture might be drawn out.Look, I wanted to give you an oven-baked recipe, I really did – I made three of them and they were fine. But the truth is that, just as you can’t make truly great chips without frying (no, you can’t. Don’t fib), it’s not fair to deny the sweet potato the chance to fulfil its potential.If you really must bake them, then use Hart’s recipe (25-30 minutes at 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 8), it’s good, but not as good as the magnificent fries from Cook’s Illustrated, which are snaffled before I’ve even finished frying the second batch. I’m sorry, but hot fat is the price you’re going to have to pay for perfection. Deal with it.They shouldn’t need much more than a sprinkling of salt, but if you’re feeling really all-American this Thanksgiving, you might enjoy The Joy of Cooking’s suggestion to dust the fries with a mixture of brown sugar and nutmeg as well. Marshmallows sadly aren’t mentioned, but they’d probably work, too.2 large sweet potatoes2 tbsp salt 1 tbsp bicarbonate of soda100g cornflour1 tbsp smoked hot paprika (optional)100g cornmeal or polenta (optional)750ml neutral oil, for deep-fryingPeel the potatoes, then cut them into wedges about 2cm thick. Rinse very well in cold water.Put two litres of water in a large pan, add the salt and bring to a boil. Add the bicarb, then cook the wedges for about five minutes, until soft on the outside but still hard in the middle. Drain well.Mix the cornflour with 120ml cold water and the paprika, if using, to make a thin paste, then add the wedges and stir to coat.Spread the cornmeal, if using, on a plate, then briefly roll the chips in it to coat lightly all over.Put the oil in a large, nonstick frying pan about 30cm in diameter and bring to 180C325F. Meanwhile, line the grill pan with foil and put in a low oven.Fry the chips in small batches until deep golden and crisp (the paprika, if using, will make it harder to tell, so look at the potato underneath), turning once, then scoop out with a slotted spoon and put on the grill rack to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining sweet potatoes, making sure the oil comes back to temperature before cooking the next batch.Season to taste and eat immediately.• Sweet potato fries: sweet treat, or the fibre-rich poor relation to the proper sort?

We certainly won’t be pushing for anything and I hope no one else does.”Midfielder Clucas opened the scoring midway through the first-half for Stoke, who had Peter Etebo sent off before the break for a challenge on Richard Keogh. Frank Lampard’s side were level five minutes after the break when Harry Wilson curled in a free-kick.Clucas then created Stoke’s winner, crossing for the former Derby forward Ince to finish from inside the penalty area, with 25 minutes to play, which earned three points for Rowett against the club he left in May.Birmingham earned a hard-fought 2-0 win over 10-man Millwall at The Den to close the gap to the play-off places. James Meredith’s first-half own goal and Michael Morrison’s close-range finish in the second period were enough to secure the points, with the hosts having Ryan Leonard dismissed for a second booking after half an hour.Birmingham ended a three-match winless run and moved up to 10th, four points off a play-off spot. Millwall remain in 21st spot, above the relegation zone only on goal difference.Wigan picked up a first win in 10 attempts with a deserved 3-1 victory over Blackburn at the DW Stadium. Veteran midfielder Gary Roberts curled home the opener shortly before half-time and James Vaughan converted a second-half penalty.Tony Mowbray made four changes from the Blackburn side thrashed 4-1 at Preston but Rovers offered little until Dan Burn’s own goal gave them hope seven minutes from time.

Jürgen Klopp lamented Neymar’s antics, the referee and Paris Saint-Germain gamesmanship but ultimately had only Liverpool’s lacklustre start to blame for another European away defeat. “A big step forward for us,” beamed Thomas Tuchel. Liverpool are in danger of finding reverse in the competition they cherish.Inspired by the infuriating but sometimes unplayable Neymar, PSG delivered a deeply impressive performance that finally lived up to their expensive ambitions among the European elite. They lost their shape and composure once James Milner halved a deficit delivered by goals from Juan Bernat and the world’s most expensive footballer but there was no disputing the merit of a victory that the French champions had to deliver.Liverpool pressed for an equaliser in the second half but in vain, failing to register a shot on target other than Milner’s penalty in first-half injury time. Defeated in all three away games for the first time in the Champions League group stage, Klopp’s team must beat Napoli 1-0 or by a two-goal margin on 11 December to avoid early elimination. It is not beyond Liverpool by any means, and Carlo Ancelotti knows only too well the powers of their recovery, but a vastly improved European display will be required to avoid the rigours of the Europa League in the new year. The visitors’ midfield was bypassed regularly here by the speed and skills of Neymar and Kylian Mbappé. Their threat to Gianluigi Buffon in the PSG goal was virtually non-existent. Poor decision-making was not the sole preserve of the Polish referee Szymon Marciniak, whose qualifications for a fixture of heavyweight calibre were called into question by Klopp.Tuchel had conceded that PSG have a mental difficulty in switching from dominating in France, where they have won the last 14 domestic cup competitions and five of the last six league titles, to imposing themselves in the Champions League. Not here. His team started superbly and the problems in Paris belonged exclusively to those in red.The PSG coach, said Klopp, would have been working on a plan to avenge the 3-2 defeat at Anfield within seconds of Roberto Firmino’s winner. It materialised in a surprising 4-4-2 formation with Ángel Di María on the right and Neymar left. Not only did it afford the Brazilian space to wreak havoc against Liverpool’s pedestrian three-man midfield, it enabled Mbappé to preoccupy the visiting defence with his pace. With Marco Verratti commanding in central midfield and PSG a whirl of white as they opened at blistering speed, Liverpool were besieged from the off. There was absolutely no surprise inside the raucous Parc des Princes when they fell behind with only 13 minutes gone.Neymar breaking from deep and Mbappé skipping clear of Joe Gomez and Dejan Lovren was a recurring theme of the first half. The breakthrough stemmed from Mbappé’s low cross from the left. Virgil van Dijk scuffed his attempted clearance skywards, Gomez and Lovren were slow to react and Bernat steered a low finish beyond the wrong-footed Alisson.Verratti was dictating proceedings with style and far too much freedom but was fortunate to escape a red card for a late and high tackle that left Gomez writhing in agony. A yellow card was deemed sufficient, and the midfielder also sailed close to a second when clipping Jordan Henderson. Liverpool improved slightly after the opening goal but were still frequently overrun in midfield. They fell two behind when the Neymar-Mbappé combination exposed their midfield again. The Brazilian sent Mbappé scampering down the left and, though Alisson made a fine block to deny Edinson Cavani converting another low Mbappé centre, the rebound rolled perfectly for Neymar who made no mistake from six yards. The kick-off was delayed by his over-elaborate celebrations.Liverpool were passive but given hope when Di María conceded a penalty with a rash challenge on Sadio Mané. Mané invited the tackle superbly, beating Marquinhos deep in the PSG half before embarking on a piercing run that evaded one defender before Di María sent him sprawling just inside the area. The referee initially, bizarrely, awarded a corner only to be corrected by the additional assistant behind the goal. Milner sent Buffon the wrong way from the penalty spot and Liverpool, from out of nowhere, were back in the contest.PSG bemoaned the penalty decision all the way down the tunnel at the interval. One coach pursued the additional assistant referee with an iPad showing a replay of the incident. Their chaotic defending after the restart illustrated the destabilising effect of the Liverpool goal and offered Klopp’s team several chances to restore parity. But despite Liverpool regularly outnumbering PSG defenders Buffon was never tested. Firmino flashed a header wide and Mohamed Salah had a shot blocked on the edge of the area. The home crowd were growing restless, their anxiety not helped when Marquinhos had a goal disallowed for offside when converting a free-kick moments after the restart.The converted central midfielder was also denied by Alisson when he met Neymar’s corner with a towering header that the Brazilian keeper saved well. Andy Robertson stopped Mbappé with a superb challenge as he shaped to shoot inside the area as PSG finished confidently. Liverpool have it all to do on the final day, yet again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/113888bbf021c22ecac00184f4520a6c3629fbb1/843_0_3196_1918/master/3196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=449501b0793323d8559ef7f1992bdace","title":"arms yemen militia were supplied by west find analysts","story":"Investigators say weapons from UK and US have fallen into hands of splinter groups in Yemen, some with links to al-Qaida and IsisAn investigation into weapons being used in the war in Yemen has shown numerous examples of arms supplied by the UK and the US, among others, ending up in the hands of militias including those linked to al-Qaida and Isis.In an apparent abuse of trade agreements by the Saudi- and UAE-led coalition, sophisticated armoured vehicles, rocket launchers, grenades and rifles are among the weapons being purchased from European and US companies and reaching local factions and groups.As international concerns continue to rise over the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, the report by journalist Mohamed Abo-Elgheit and the Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalists (Arij) alleges that not only are weapons being openly passed to militias aligned to the Saudi coalition but also to marginalised and feuding groups fighting their own territorial battles.The details, to be aired in an Arabic-language documentary, The End User, came from analysis of thousands of broadcasts, social media and closed internet groups, alongside intensive research to verify the origins of weapons.“Where we found abuse of the end user certification system, we sought explanations from the arms companies and government who authorised the sales to the coalition. Many simply turn a blind eye,” said Abo-Elgheit.The documentary accuses the Saudi coalition, weapons suppliers and governments of a sustained breach of “end user” certification laws stretching back to the beginning of the conflict in 2015. In 2016 UN Security Council issued a warning over “lax accountability” on the part of the coalition, and expressed concern that weapons may be erted to the black market.No penalties have ever been levied for breaches. Certificates are meant to provide an assurance to those selling arms, or authorising their sale, that weapons will be used only by the buyer, and not passed or sold on.Abo-Elgheit and his team compiled evidence that calls into question the credibility of such certificates signed by Saudi Arabia and UAE.Germany became the first EU country to officially raise the issue with Saudi Arabia, after footage revealed the Houthis in possession of G3 rifles that had been air-dropped into their region. In the historical south-western city of Taiz, an absence of state or security services has allowed Aqap (al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) to step into the vacuum. In 2016, Aqap broadcast footage of a battle in Taiz against the Houthis, in which their fighters used German MG3 machine guns.“We spotted dozens of these guns in the possession of Yemenis in different provinces. A resistance fighter in Taiz told us that the Saudi army had handed them out to its allies,” said Abo-Elgheit. The gun is made by Heckler \u0026amp Koch, who also licence Saudi Arabia to make G3 and G36 assault rifles.Germany and Belgium have now refused to authorise arms export to parties involved in the Yemen conflict, but others refute allegations of ersion breaches, including the UK. A complex splintering and merging of factions has made the situation in Yemen particularly volatile, said Abo-Elgheit. “Since the start of the war, the Saudi-backed government in Yemen has continued to merge popular resistance forces into the army, including Abu al-Abbas Brigades, which became part of the Armoured Brigade 35 in Taiz,” he said. “By arming these groups the coalition is in breach of international law, fuelling all-round conflict and human rights abuses.”Abu al-Abbas is on the terror watchlists of many countries, including Saudi Arabia.Brigadier General Mohamed al-Mahmoudi, former director of security in Taiz, said, “It is strange for an entity to be classified as a terrorist organisation, while being supported by those who classified it as such.” A Brigade spokesperson said: “Nothing has changed. The weapons and financial support are still the same as before.”“Data shows that between 2011 and 2014 Saudi Arabia and the UAE purchased 2,600 Oshkosh M-ATV mine-resistant ambush-protected (Mrap) vehicles from the US. In 2015, the Abu al-Abbas group received three such vehicles whilst others have fallen into the hands of other Yemeni factions or the hands of Houthis,” Abo-Elgheit said.In November 2016, Sheikh Rouzik, prominent fundamentalist Islamist leader in Taiz, received a British-made Aardvark JSFU mine-clearing sweeper. Pictures depict Rouzik sat inside the vehicle clearly marked with Saudi army emblems.In April 2017, the investigators obtained footage of an Abu al-Abbas Brigades fighter in Taiz placing Swiss-made grenades on to his belt, and a photograph posted on social media in May 2017 depicted a soldier holding the same branded grenade.An Abu al-Abbas commander in Taiz showed the investigators grenades the resistance was using. Swiss makers RUAG confirmed that the grenades were part of a consignment delivered to the UAE in 2003. In February this year militias fighting for an independent state in Yemen’s south raised the South Yemen flag on US-made armoured vehicles, the BAE Caiman Mrap. The same southern resistance later joined forces with the UAE-backed Giants Brigade and received dozens of US-made MaxxPro armoured vehicles. In 2014 the UAE spent $2.5bn (£1.95bn) on 1150 Caiman and 3360 MaxxPro vehicles from the US. This deal included a technology protection clause and end user certificate. The supplier of Caimans in this case was UK-based BAE Systems, although the contract was procured via its subsidiary in Texas.The vehicles have been sighted on numerous occasions on all sides of the conflict, leading to Yemeni army officials’ complaints of being less well equipped than the resistance groups.Last month a video released by the Houthis depicted arms seized from the Giants Brigade. Among the spoils were the Swiss grenades.Ahmed Himmiche, coordinator of the Security Council Panel of Experts on Yemen, said: “We learned from sources that some Yemeni fighters had sold their weapons, especially when they did not receive wages.”He said battlefield weapons leaking into domestic arms markets increased the terror attack risk globally.Monitoring the black market, Himmiche said prices were stable or declining despite the increased demand due to war: a clear and worrying indicator that ersion into the black market was rising, because of the resulting glut that reduced prices.Abo-Elgheit used pseudonyms and encrypted message services to reach online networks operating in Taiz. They found a variety of illegal arms trading, documenting dozens of brand new German rifles being sold. Posing as potential buyers, they confirmed the German origins and serial numbers for authentication. Also being offered were Minimis, clearly stamped with the manufacturer name FN Herstal.“At one stage, Canada seemed to be the only country whose weapons were not erted to the Yemenis,” said Ab-Elgheit. That changed this year, when with Yemeni allies, the Saudi army invaded the Houthi stronghold of Saada. Brigadier General Abdullah al-Ajabi, a Yemeni commander in Saada, appeared in videos holding a Canadian-made PGW sniper rifle. Another soldier carried a German assault weapon.Between July and October Canadian Lav-25 armoured vehicles were spotted six times in Yemeni convoys in Hajjah and Saada. In several cases apparent attempts had been made to erase Saudi markings.Abo-Elgheit approached manufacturers and governments with his findings to ask what actions would be taken against Saudi Arabia and UAE. H\u0026ampK failed to respond, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy said it “has no valid evidence” that exports were being used in Yemen but insisted it takes non-compliance seriously. Belgian authorities refused to comment regarding FN Herstal.In response to questions over BAE and Aardvark, the UK’s Department for International Trade said export licences are not required to export minesweepers.BAE did not respond to a request for comment.“The main problem is Iran to Yemen, not the west to Yemen, which is nothing more than a political agenda,” said Graham Jones, chair of the UK committees on arms export controls.Canadian manufacturer General Dynamics declined to comment, but a foreign ministry spokesperson, Allison Lewis, said the government had the power to cancel or suspend export permits, should they “become aware of evidence that the authorised end use of an export is being violated”.The Swiss government said it was unaware of Swiss weapons being used in Yemen and would be investigating the findings. The US defence department also said it would be seeking to investigate. A spokesman added: “Recipients of US-origin defence equipment have signed an obligation to adhere to end-use requirements as outlined in agreements concluded with the United States government. This is to make sure that those articles are used in the manner intended and consistent with our legal obligations, foreign policy goals, and values.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b79559668f7ad136d222dcd36c15c0b30ec3d6f/0_0_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efee944098ff5f2ca24a81b6ca7be6a6","title":"fir crying out loud share your photos of the worst christmas trees","story":"After the White House caused seasonal smirks with its latest offering, we want to see more seasonal decoration failsLike it or not, Black Friday has come and gone and with December approaching, Christmas is on the horizon.

She’s between a rock and a hard place, but she’s doing her best and if we don’t have a deal we’ll be in a right pickle.”Other locals in the rural Renfrewshire town express a mixture of boredom, bafflement and frustration at the latest iteration of the ongoing Brexit saga.“Personally I’d rather we were remaining, but people who think we can go back to the EU and get a better deal are living in fairy land.”Darren Bolton, sales manager for a renewables company, accepts May’s insistence that Scottish businesses want certainty – “People in my industry are apprehensive about spending money right now” – but is less convinced by her ability to deliver it with the deal she is putting to parliament.“To be honest I don’t think they’ve got a clue. They’ll need to have another vote, because there are all these big issues that still need clarification and so much has changed.”Kevin Pringle, former director of communications for the Scottish National party, who now works on behalf of the Scotland for a People’s Vote campaign, argues: “What’s interesting is that opinion south of the border has moved closer to opinion in Scotland. Yes there’s a fatigue about Brexit but the result is the exact opposite to the conclusion that the prime minster has drawn - what people want is not to get on and deliver it but to stop it.”Over the past week, the UK’s post-Brexit relationship with the common fisheries policy – especially loathed by Scotland’s North Sea fleets – has become a flashpoint, with first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, accusing Theresa May of “yet another Tory sellout”. The UK government has insisted that access to fishing will not be linked with final trade terms, but statements from EU leaders over the weekend suggest that access for their fishermen to UK waters will remain key to negotiations after March 2019.“The treatment of the fishing industry over the years has a totemic status in Scottish politics that it doesn’t have elsewhere,” Pringle explains. “But now it’s connected to the disillusionment that people have felt with the deal, because if there was one issue where the leave campaign had traction in Scotland it was fishing. In the rest of the UK a number of different arguments – immigration, health service funding - had force too, but in Scotland there was only one. If the deal is not seen to be delivering for the fishing industry then it invalidates the whole thing from a Scottish leave perspective.”When Sturgeon announced that SNP MPs would back a second EU referendum at her party’s conference in October – having previously declined to support the option – some activists raised concerns that this could create a damaging precedent for another independence vote. While others accept that the political conditions are not right for another campaign to leave the UK amid so much unfolding uncertainty, those concerns continue, especially after Sturgeon yesterday appeared to push back any announcement of plans for a second referendum until the new year.Despite claims from senior Tory Brexiters that Theresa May’s deal, in particular the Northern Ireland backstop, represents a threat to union, Curtice is sceptical. “The idea that Scotland is going to vote for independence because Northern Ireland might have a slightly different relationship with the EU, I’d be very surprised if it were to fly. And the difficulty for the SNP over fishing is that every time they raise it the answer is: ‘You guys want to stay in the EU’, end of story.”“The crucial thing for the SNP is whether Brexit goes pear-shaped economically and this changes the calculus for voters so far as the perceived economic consequences of independence are concerned. But, ironically, nobody is doing more at the moment to try and stop Brexit than Nicola Sturgeon. She’s trying to stop the one thing that actually might be to her advantage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f490d8362252be16bf92fe8a7c61fe4dd92b50dc/588_195_3879_2327/master/3879.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e26960ed6fa216fe1699d6506cd9672","title":"carneys pessimistic brexit prophecies look like last roll of dice","story":"Bank of England governor says we must prepare for the worst, but will anyone listen?And the governor of the Bank of England certainly laid it on. Asked by MPs on the Treasury select committee to imagine what could happen to the economy in the worst possible scenario, Carney painted a bleak picture of goods not clearing customs, the EU refusing to accept UK products and financial markets in meltdown.The governor’s was not the only game in town. There had been another attempt at futurology earlier in the day when the Department for Exiting the EU published a paper outlining four possible Brexit scenarios: May’s now defunct frictionless trade Chequers model a Norway-type arrangement where Britain is outside the customs union but part of the single market a free-trade deal similar to that signed between the EU and Canada and operating on World Trade Organization terms. It concluded the prime minister’s Chequers plan offered the least economically damaging form of Brexit.Predicting the future of the economy is next to impossible. Forecasters find it hard enough to gauge what will happen over the next three months, let alone the next 15 years. The Treasury and the Bank of England have got it wrong many times in the recent past – not least in their failure to spot the 2008 financial crisis coming – so any studies of the impact of Brexit have to come with a prominent health warning.And both did. The Whitehall-prepared paper was full of caveats, noting that the structure of the economy could change radically over the next 15 years. It takes no account, for example, of two factors that could have a much bigger longer-term impact than Brexit: the march of the robots and climate change. Government policy is also assumed to be unchanged, which of course is unrealistic.Even so, May will welcome the governor’s doomsday scenarios and the Whitehall version, however hedged around with qualifications.But we have been here before. In the weeks leading up to the EU referendum in June 2016, both the Bank and the Treasury issued warnings of the bad things that would happen in the event of a vote to leave, none of which came true. This time the constituency is much smaller: the 600-odd MPs who will vote on May’s EU agreement early next month. It looks like the last roll of the dice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46e169aba31cb3dacaeaeb1a16f2fa01830ad28b/0_165_4956_2974/master/4956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4362779d7775a1319277baf1e9e18b58","title":"economic forecasts strike blow to theresa mays brexit deal","story":"Bank and Treasury predictions showing UK would be better off within EU undermine PM’s positionTheresa May’s campaign to sell her Brexit deal to sceptical MPs and a ided country ran into further difficulties when a string of official economic forecasts concluded that the UK would be better off remaining in the European Union.“Our job is not to hope for the best but to prepare for the worst,” Carney said, as he described what could happen if MPs vote down May’s deal on 11 December, and the government and parliament cannot agree on an alternative by next March.The official warnings will lead Jo Johnson, a pro-remain Conservative MP who wants a second referendum, to warn on Thursday that the economic credibility of the Tories was now at stake – while Brexiters accused the Bank and the Treasury of engaging in “project fear”.“The Conservative party’s reputation for economic competence would be undermined by implementing a botched Brexit, especially one that the government’s own analysis suggests will cause economic harm,” Johnson will say.Labour responded by tabling its own Brexit amendment rejecting May’s deal on Wednesday night. Jeremy Corbyn said: “Labour will oppose Theresa May’s botched Brexit,” adding that her deal “puts jobs, rights and people’s livelihoods at risk”.The proposed amendment said the party was opposing May’s Brexit because she had failed to provide for a permanent customs union and a strong single-market deal. It would “therefore lead to increased barriers to trade in goods and services, would not protect workers’ rights and environmental standards,” the text added.May, meanwhile, insisted at a combative session of prime minister’s questions that the country would be “better off with this deal” because the economy would still be growing, and accused Corbyn of having a vague Brexit plan of his own.“What does Labour have to offer? Six bullet points. My weekend shopping list is longer than that,” May told MPs.May and her leading ministers intend to highlight the advantages of her Brexit deal over the next fortnight, selecting a different issue each day.The idea is to try to persuade sceptical MPs and the British public to back May in the vote on 11 December, which the Conservative chief whip, Julian Smith, confirmed on Wednesday night would take place after six alternative amendments had been considered and following five days of debate.Carney denied he was scaremongering and said the Bank was providing an analysis that was demanded by parliament. “We have to do it,” he said, saying the Bank’s task was to make the forecasts required.Angry Brexiters – many of whom are among the 94 Conservative MPs who have said they would vote down her final deal – lined up to attack the Bank, the Treasury and other government departments.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the hard Brexit European Research Group, accused Carney of talking down the pound, and failing to understand his role. “He is not there to create panic,” he said.Hours earlier, a Whitehall analysis, produced for MPs in the run-up to the vote, concluded that the UK would be significantly worse off under five possible Brexit scenarios in 15 years’ time, including the Norway model thought to be favoured by some in the cabinet, and the Canada free trade model favoured by hard Brexiters.Philip Hammond, the chancellor, conceded that the UK would be worse off regardless after Brexit, saying: “If you look at this purely from an economic point of view, yes there will be a cost to leaving the European Union because there will be impediments to our trade.”Officials were forced to compare the economic merits of the Brexit scenarios relative to staying in the EU after the government was forced to accept an amendment from pro-remain Labour MP Chuka Umunna and Conservative MP Anna Soubry in the debates on the finance bill last week.“Ministers were forced today to publish analysis comparing different scenarios to our current arrangements. The data is clear: nothing beats the deal we have as members of the EU,” Umunna said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7105a9165ba908537b787eb56f0c0671b3ded29/0_377_5477_3286/master/5477.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90776384e632156bc5f324f9782e191e","title":"labour seize second brexit vote option john mcdonnell","story":"Shadow chancellor appears to shift party’s position, saying general election will be hard to achieveJohn McDonnell has said Labour will “inevitably” back a second referendum if the party is unable to force a general election, in comments widely regarded as marking a shift in Labour’s position.The shadow chancellor repeated that a general election remained a preference but admitted it was “very difficult to do” because of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.“If that’s not possible, we’ll be calling upon the government then to join us in a public vote,” he told the BBC. “It’s difficult to judge each stage, but that’s the sequence I think that we’ll inevitably go through over this period.”Asked to confirm that he thought this was “inevitable”, McDonnell said: “That’s right. Our policy is if we can’t get a general election, then the other option which we’ve kept on the table is a people’s vote.”If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long. After a rapid leadership contest, a different leader could appeal to a majority in parliament, perhaps by offering a softer deal.Tory backbenchers depose herJacob Rees-Mogg gets his way and there is a no-confidence vote. A new leader then tries to assemble a majority behind a tweaked deal.May calls a general electionMay could choose to take the ultimate gamble and hope that voters would back her deal, over the heads of squabbling MPs.Labour tries to force an electionThe opposition tables a vote of no confidence.\u0026nbsp​If May lost​,\u0026nbspthe opposition (or a new Conservative leader) would have two weeks to form an alternative government that could win a second confidence vote. If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.A second referendum gathers supportThis is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u0026nbspNo dealThe EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.The strength of McDonnell’s comments about the prospect of a new referendum in recent days has threatened to open up a faultline between him and the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who is reported to be far more lukewarm about the idea.Some shadow cabinet members confessed to being baffled about the comments on Wednesday, and suggested McDonnell was less enthusiastic about a referendum in private. One asked: “Is he running with the hares and hunting with the hounds?”Labour sought to seize back the agenda last night by publishing the amendment it plans to table to the government’s motion on May’s Brexit deal.The amendment repudiates the deal, saying it “fails to provide for a permanent UK-EU customs union and strong single market deal,” and “is likely to lead to the implementation of a backstop provision in Northern Ireland that is neither politically nor economically sustainable”.It also seeks to take a no deal Brexit off the table, by saying parliament, “declines to approve the United Kingdom’s leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement”. And it goes on to say parliament will “pursue every option” to prevent either a no deal, or the government’s deal.The amendment does not touch on a second referendum but the prime minister seized on McDonnell’s remarks to claim Labour wants to block Brexit. Responding to McDonnell, Theresa May said: “His comments about the second referendum today show that what the Labour party want to do is frustrate Brexit. They want to overturn the will of the British people. Parliament overwhelmingly gave the British people a vote. They voted to leave. I think it’s a matter of trust in politicians that they actually deliver on Brexit for the British people.”Both McDonnell and Corbyn are acutely conscious that the vast majority of Labour members and many of its MPs are ardently anti-Brexit. They fear alienating a swath of supporters if they ignore the pleas of this group.However, they also believe it is highly unlikely that the idea of a second referendum could command a majority in the House of Commons – though momentum could build if the meaningful vote on May’s Brexit deal on 11 December is lost.Corbyn’s spokesman insisted on Wednesday that the party’s first priority would be to try to build support for its own, alternative Brexit deal rather than jumping to demand another poll.At a  Live event less than 24 hours earlier, McDonnell had said a second Brexit referendum “might be an option we seize upon”, suggesting for the first time that remain should be on the ballot paper and insisting that a no-deal Brexit should not.At the event on Tuesday, McDonnell fleshed out his views on how a second referendum should operate and said he personally would vote to remain in any new referendum.That marked another contrast with Corbyn, who said he did not know which way he would vote when asked on Sky News last week.McDonnell said he would vote remain and that the country could not risk putting no-deal as an option on any ballot paper. “There’s an overwhelming majority in parliament against that happening, because of the damage.”McDonnell said he had recently met leading figures from the People’s Vote campaign, including Alastair Campbell and Ed Miliband’s former adviser Tom Baldwin.He said he expected May to lose the first Commons vote and to present a tweaked deal that he predicted would fail as well. “Whether and when we put a vote of no confidence down will be a tactical decision,” he said. “We’ll want a maximum effect.”He said the party had been meeting to discuss coordination with the Scottish National party, the Liberal Democrats and Caroline Lucas of the Greens. “If we can’t get a general election, people’s vote is on the table and that might be an option we seize upon,” he said.Before that, Labour would offer its own versions of a deal, he said. “We’ll have to go through that sequence to show we’re doing everything we can,” he said.Labour’s official position is to push its own version of a Brexit deal involving a permanent customs union and a close relationship with the single market that falls short of full membership.Sources close to McDonnell played down any difference in position to Corbyn and said his comments were not a change in policy.Speaking after prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Corbyn’s spokesman restated Labour’s position, as agreed at the party’s conference in Liverpool, that should the government lose the vote and a general election not be called, “all options would be on the table”.However, he said: “We do not regard no deal as any kind of option,” and he declined to set out any others, aside from trying to rally parliament behind Labour’s alternative approach.“The key point is that the option of Labour’s alternative plan has to be on the table, and we believe there is majority support for it in parliament, and it would also command majority support in the country, across both leave and remain voters,” the spokesman said.

The company believes it can make a significant return on its investment by securing lucrative sponsorship and television deals in the next decade.Each club would be armed with a payment of £20m. The aim is that it will be used for infrastructure projects and reducing debt with the salary cap pegged for the next two seasons, but sides are allowed two marquee players who are not part of the cap and Read is in that category.Read, 33, has said he is likely to leave New Zealand after the 2019 World Cup. “We have always thought as a family that we would like to go overseas and use that experience for the kids,” he went on. “That is probably the main option at the moment.” He revealed that he had plenty of options, with retirement being one of them.Racing 92 are confident that if Read does move to Europe, the northern half of Paris will be his destination. They had lined up the New Zealand centre Ryan Crotty, but that move has been shelved because signing both would take them over the Top 14’s salary cap.A number of All Blacks have played for Racing. Joe Rokocoko is in the current squad, Dan Carter last season finished a three-year stint there and Ali Williams ended his career with last season’s beaten European Champions Cup finalists.Racing’s president, Jacky Lorenzetti, has made signing Read his top priority, but reports in France claim that two Premiership clubs have made offers to Read, who took over the New Zealand captaincy from Richie McCaw after the 2015 World Cup.Other All Blacks will be targets for French and English clubs after the World Cup, not least the fly-half Beauden Barrett, the full-back Ben Smith and Crotty, while the prop Owen Franks, whose brother Ben plays for Northampton, has said that moving overseas is an option.The salary cap in France is £3m more than it is in the Premiership but the marquee player provision partly makes up the difference and in a season in which, approaching the halfway mark, eight clubs are in a relegation battle, the need for players who can make a difference is more acute.Worcester face losing their Wales wing Josh Adams, who is out of contract at Sixways at the end of the season. The Scarlets want to re-sign their former player and if they make him an offer which is turned down, Adams would not be available for his country under a rule that stipulates exiles who have opted not to play for a region need to have won at least 60 caps.“Josh would be welcome here, there is no doubt about that,” said the Scarlets head coach, Wayne Pivac, who will take charge of Wales after the World Cup. “Finances meant we were not able to retain him after he came through the academy.

But it also showed the size of task she faces to persuade the more than a dozen members who are calling for new leadership and whose votes Pelosi will need to win an absolute majority on the House floor at the start of next year.The full House of Representatives, including Republicans, will elect a new speaker on 3 January. If Democrats win a final House race yet to be called after the midterm elections, and where their candidate is leading, they will hold 235 seats, meaning Pelosi could afford to lose 17 Democratic votes if all Republicans oppose her.In brief remarks to the press as votes were being tabulated, Pelosi, who ran unopposed, said she was in “pretty good shape” and expressed confidence that she would overcome internal resistance to be the next speaker.“I’m talking about scores of members of Congress who just gave me a vote – are giving me a vote of confidence,” Pelosi said. “That is where our focus is. Are there dissenters? Yes. But I expect to have a powerful vote as we go forward.”In 2016, Pelosi lost 63 votes in the Democratic caucus election, nearly twice the number she lost on Wednesday. When it came to the floor vote, only four Democrats opposed her. This time could prove trickier after several new members vowed to vote against Pelosi as candidates.Moments before the nominating contest began on Wednesday afternoon, Pelosi huddled with leading rebels, including congresswoman Kathleen Rice, of New York, and Congressmen Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged her for the post of minority leader in 2016.“We met with Leader Pelosi and tried to engage her in a reasonable conversation about leadership transition. Unfortunately, our concerns were dismissed outright,” Rice said. “We remain united behind our goal of new leadership and we intend to vote against Leader Pelosi in Caucus and on the floor of the House.”Moulton, who circulated a letter signed by 16 Democratic incumbents and new members, that calls for a change in leadership, called on Pelosi to develop a “plan for succession”.“No one wants to see this civil conversation spill into a floor fight,” he said in a statement. “Our request was, and has always been, simple. Produce a meaningful plan for a leadership transition, as you promised in the summer, to allow a new generation of leadership to step forward.”The leaders of the so-called “Never Nancy” movement did not step forward to offer an alternative vision during the leadership election, a move that raised questions about their overall strategy.“I don’t know how you elect somebody that’s imaginary,” said Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio who spoke on behalf of Pelosi during the vote. “You can’t vote for a person that’s not a candidate, so there we are. We have one candidate.”Pelosi did, however, manage to reach an 11th-hour agreement with a bloc of moderate Democrats who had threatened to withhold their votes if Pelosi refused to commit to a set of House rules changes that would give rank-and-file members more influence in Congress.After lengthy negotiations, the group struck a deal with Pelosi that they said would help “break the gridlock” in Congress.Though Pelosi ran unopposed, the caucus chose to vote by paper ballot, which gave new members who ran on a promise to vote against Pelosi for speaker the opportunity to declare their positions.The leadership elections began earlier on Wednesday morning and were expected to last late into the evening and possibly into Thursday. To begin the process, Democrats elected Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, who beat the California congresswoman Barbara Lee in a competitive race for Democratic caucus chair.Both are members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Progressive caucus, and the choice left the caucus “torn”, according to Democratic congressman Gerry Connolly of Virginia, who wouldn’t say who he voted for.After the vote, Lee, 72, who would have been the first black woman in Democratic leadership, said the party still had a ways to go to break down “institutional barriers” that prevent women and people of color from rising through the ranks. She said she “absolutely” believed ageism and sexism were factors in her loss​.“That’s something women, especially women of color and African American women, in particular, have to fight constantly,” she said. “But we still have many glass ceilings to break for women of color.”Jeffries’ ascent to the No 5 spot ensures that the caucus will have two African Americans on the leadership team for the first time.​​​At 48, Jeffries will be among the youngest members of the leadership team alongside Ben Ray Luján, 46, who was unanimously approved to be assistant Democratic leader​ position after steering the House Democratic campaign arm during the 2018 midterm election cycle. Both ​are viewed by their colleagues as a potential​ heirs when Pelosi steps down. Their promotions could help allay concerns that the party is being led by three septuagenarian.Pelosi now has the next several weeks to erode the remaining opposition to her nomination.Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat who had signed a letter opposing Pelosi but endorsed her last week after securing a commitment on two legislative priorities, urged the holdouts to follow his lead and use their vote as leverage – before the fight spilled out onto the House floor.“Democracy is a sloppy mess,” he said. “There are a lot of differing views, even within the Democratic caucus. The ability to pull that together is not clean and efficient all the time.”He warned that if Pelosi’s opponents were to follow through with their threat to deny her the speakership on the House floor, “it would create the space for someone undeserving to grab it”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/643bf112a7ddb271cff80cf37270321ad71a7355/0_134_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e94ac0c383899854290017cfb284560f","title":"panama china us latin america canal","story":"A spat over the site of China’s embassy has underlined the strategic value of the canal – through which two-thirds of ships to or from the US passJutting four kilometres into the Pacific, the Amador causeway islands separate the concrete and glass skyline of Panama City from the soaring iron arch of the Bridge of the Americas – under which 40 cargo ships pass each day en route to or from the Panama Canal.Linked to the mainland by a slender causeway, these strategic outcrops are home to a handful of derelict buildings once used to house US military personnel.But they have become a new flashpoint in the global rivalry between Beijing and Washington, as the US struggles to develop a coherent strategy to deal with China’s rising influence in Latin America.China’s plans to build a new embassy on the islands were derailed after US officials pressured the government of Panama’s president, Juan Carlos Varela, to withdraw its offer of a four-hectare plot, according to senior Panamanian and diplomatic sources.“Of course there was pushback from the US: they weren’t going to allow a huge Chinese flag next to the entrance to the canal,” a diplomatic source told the . “But local pressure was also important. Handing over that land to the Chinese would have been a hugely unpopular move by the Varela government.”Panama’s government has insisted that the decision was based on security and environmental concerns.But a previous plan to build a new Chinese embassy in the traditional diplomatic district of Panama City was also blocked by objections from Washington, and Beijing has now established a temporary mission in an office block.The incident may prove to be a pyrrhic victory for Washington, however. This weekend, the Chinese premier, Xi Jinping, arrives in Panama for a visit aimed at cementing ties with the Central American nation.It will be the first such visit by a senior Chinese figure since Panama cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan to open formal relations with Beijing in June 2017.Since then, the two countries have signed 28 diplomatic and investment agreements, a $500m renminbi-denominated “Panda” bond is expected before the end of the year and Chinese contractors have won major contracts for a port, convention centre and a new bridge over the canal.The growth of Chinese investment and influence in the country has been the source of growing unease in Washington.In July, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, ended a visit to Panama with the warning that “when China comes calling, it’s not always to the good of your citizens”. He added that state-run Chinese firms often operated with political, rather than market-driven motives.Xi’s visit comes amid an escalating trade war between China and the US, which has highlighted Panama’s strategic importance as a pinch-point of world commerce.Two-thirds of ships to or from the US pass through the Panama Canal – which was an unincorporated territory of the US between 1903 and 1979 and was home to dozens of American military installations.“Recent rhetoric from Washington suggests the US has not accepted that the canal has shifted from being a military asset to a commercial one,” said Eddie Tapiero, a competitive intelligence specialist for the Panama Canal Authority and author of a new book on China-Panama relations. “The US has a decision to make: does it accept free trade in the Americas or does it revert to a cold war approach? The latter would be disastrous.”Negotiations for a free trade agreement between China and Panama are at an advanced stage Panamanian officials say the country can benefit from its growing role as a regional logistics hub, build its exports to China and protect local farmers.“We will become the gateway for Chinese goods into Latin America,” the trade minister, Augusto Arosemena, told the . “I think Panama will be an example of how smaller countries can negotiate with China.”Meanwhile, the US has been caught flatfooted: diplomats were unaware of Varela’s decision to establish ties with Beijing until hours before its announcement and the state department has yet to name a replacement for John Feeley, who stood down as ambassador in March saying he was “honor bound” to resign rather than serve under Donald Trump.Wei Qiang, the Chinese ambassador to Panama, has dismissed the “apprehensive, fearful and jealous speculations” over his country’s intentions. “China’s world vision is one of dialogue and accommodation rather than confrontation, we have no option but to let the facts speak for themselves,” he said at a recent book launch.But in recent years, Beijing has shown growing interest in strategic infrastructure projects in the region: Chinese companies are involved in a project to build a rival interoceanic canal through Nicaragua and investigated the option of a “dry canal” railroad linking Colombia’s Atlantic and Pacific coasts.Some Panamanians are also wary of Bejing’s intentions, said Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations at the University of Panama. “The Chinese are here for the long term – and they’ve come for the canal,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab803fb2e6205a6c69d2970215bb8f121129ddd9/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97fd6ff264e8b2eca36e54a80f647b93","title":"the conservation conversation why we need to talk about trees","story":"With tree planting rates in the UK the lowest they have been in 40 years, and more trees being cut down than planted, action is needed to balance the losses. Can a pledge to plant a million trees in five years save our forests? By  Amy-Jane BeerIt’s easy to view trees as scenery. They don’t move about, their longevity gives them an air of permanence, and they support complex biological communities. They are habitat, but they are also inhabitants – fellow Earthlings, whose ability to sense and respond to the world around them we are only just beginning to understand.Despite government targets to increase tree cover, rates of tree planting in the UK are declining, with efforts in 2016 the lowest for 40 years, and failing to match the number of trees felled.The type of species planted is important in ecological and human terms. Native species offer far greater value for wildlife, but other factors to consider are the expected size of full-grown trees, the kind of management that might be required and what uses the tree might serve: for example, shading city streets, forming hedges or producing crops.The best time to plant a tree is autumn or winter, so that the saplings have a good chance to establish a decent root system before the next growth season. This greatly improves their survival chances.When choosing trees to plant, it’s best to avoid imported stock, and if you must plant non-native species, buy locally grown saplings from a reputable nursery. Catastrophes such as the arrival and spread of Chalara (the cause of ash dieback disease) might have been prevented by better attention to imports.Tree planting doesn’t have to mean forest creation. Recent years have seen an increasing interest in street trees, wood pastures and community orchards. Fruit trees have a lot going for them – not only do they provide an obvious return on investment, but they also develop so-called veteran features, such as rot holes, much earlier than native hardwoods. Dead wood is a crucial habitat for a huge array of other species, from fungi to hole-nesting birds and from the myriad invertebrates that use decaying trunks and fallen logs as nurseries to the badgers and hedgehogs that eat them.Planting trees is only half the story, and conserving the trees we already have has never been more important. Replacing a mature tree takes decades, yet the trees being lost are often old ones. At a community level, the loss of such trees can be deeply felt. Effective schemes to increase the visibility of established trees before they face a threat include adopting them, mapping them, and submitting them as candidates in tree of the year competitions. It all helps, and getting to know an inidual tree in all its seasonal moods has a power of its own. Try it – you might discover your oldest and most mysterious friend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb9e34fb343adf4b0153176ecc951ed3faf913e/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e415c131b167cbf3ecca3e8a4168d5c9","title":"how do trees survive in winter","story":"Some shed their leaves others rely on antifreeze in their veins (or pine needles) to survive the colder months. But trees couldn’t survive winter without the special relationship they have with birdsAside from the music of the westerlies playing through those skeletal canopies, British woods, when stripped of their leaves, tend to have an atmosphere of expectant quietude. Winter is a time of frugality, and the two major tree types, deciduous and evergreen, adopt very different strategies to cope with the double challenge of little sunlight and low temperatures.A deciduous tree operates by shedding all its leaves. This means that it lacks the means to photosynthesise and, thus, to generate fresh energy for five to six months of the year. However, there’s an upside to losing foliage, because it has ended the loss of moisture that occurs through leaves.This endless recycling of water from the trees to the atmosphere, known as transpiration, is costly. A single large mature oak may possess up to 200,000 leaves, and lose as much as 150,000 litres of water over the course of a year. A summer wood in full foliage conceals thousands of rising columns of tree-borne moisture, which is why it often feels so warm and humid within woods, when the surrounding countryside can be cool and breezy.Conifer trees reduce the stress of water loss by possessing fine needle-like leaves with minimum surface area and thick, waxy water-retaining cuticles. The adaptations slow down the process of transpiration. While the structure of evergreen foliage doesn’t have the energy-producing efficiency of a flat plate-like deciduous leaf, the fact that conifers can continue to photosynthesise year-round compensates for this. Some pines even have antifreeze in their needles, to enable them to work in icy conditions.The dormancy of winter trees means that this is the best time for planting or transferring them around our gardens. Choose a warm winter’s day so the earth is soft, dig a hole deep enough so the soil fully protects the roots from frost, then water well once planted. Observing how that new tree slowly grows and flourishes is one of the most satisfying processes in gardening.Trees also make use of the winter to do some self-propagation of their own. Much of the work for this process begins in the autumn, with the production of seeds and fruit. British oaks are a perfect example. From September onwards they leave a great larder of sugar- and protein-rich food for hungry birds or mammals, in the form of acorns. Squirrels, rodents and several species of crow store these nuts away to consume during the colder months. Yet, no species has more of a capacity to plan ahead than the creature that William Henry Hudson called the “British bird of paradise”: the European jay.In late autumn, this glorious pink-and-blue bird can be seen making repeat journeys to and from acorn-producing oak trees. The jay then buries them, sometimes flying several miles from the original source tree. Over the course of autumn, the average bird hides about 5,000 acorns. Across Britain and Ireland, the entire jay population stores somewhere in the region of 1.7bn acorns.The birds possess extraordinary memories for where they have hidden their stores, and yet – here is the clever part – they can’t remember them all. Not only do those forgotten acorns stand a strong chance of growing into oak saplings the following spring, but jays show a preference for open ground between tree cover in their choice of burial sites. In other words, they plant their acorns precisely where they might grow best.This acorn storage system thus benefits the jay twice over. Not only does it provide itself with food for the winter, but by forgetting some of its larder it also creates fresh habitat for future generations of jays. These birds are truly s of our oak woods. But it works both ways: by taking care of the birds, the trees ensure they prosper themselves.The dispersal of seed is, in fact, a major part of the woodland scene in winter. Hawthorn, holly, yew, mountain ash, crab apple, blackthorn and sea buckthorn – not to forget woodland shrubs, such as mistletoe and ivy, or garden favourites including cotoneaster and pyracantha – all produce fruit that birds love.Thrushes are especially drawn to these trees and consume vast quantities of their fruits. In return for this generosity, the thrushes then fly to their roosts in some hedge or tall tree at dusk and do what comes naturally. They poop out seeds during the night and leave each one in its own little store of fertiliser.So woods and birds are truly partners in reproduction. You can see how they interact on any winter’s day and in any wood, from John O’Groats to Land’s End, and from the mountain tops to the seashore. Because we legally “own” it, people like to imagine that they control the land, but the British woodlands have ways of shaping their own destinies.Yorkshire Tea and treesYorkshire Tea is planting a million trees over five years – with a bit of help from the Woodland Trust, UK schoolchildren and Kenyan tea farmers.

Photograph: Paddy Logue A dolphin has been spotted swimming in the river Liffey in Dublin on Wednesday morning.A number of people have taken to social media to share videos of the common dolphin, in particular around the North Wall Quay area and near Butt Bridge.The Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (DSPCA) said it has spoken to a member of the Marine Animal Rescue.Clowie Russell, marine mammal ecologist with the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group, said the sighting was “unusual” and possibly a result of Storm Diana.“Common dolphins are not usually seen in the river Liffey so it is unusual, they normally are seen in big groups and they’re normally seen in deeper water so it is unusual for him to be by himself far up. He could possibly have gotten lost due to the weather,” she told The .Ms Russell said the group will be monitoring the situation and are not “too worried”.“If he was strong enough to get up the river, he should be strong enough to get back out. Hopefully he’s gone back out now with high tide,” she added.“He does look quite healthy, he’s not lethargic but if it was the case that he was there for a couple of days and we thought he was in trouble, we could see if we could coax him out with a boat. We try not to interfere, that would be a last resort.”The Irish Whale and Dolphin Group said they received “several calls” from concerned members of the public on Wednesday asking what could be done for the dolphin.“Our reply is always in these circumstances not to interfere,” it said. “If this dolphin is, as the video suggests, in good health and was able to swim upriver into the city centre, then it should be able to swim downriver on its own steam.”The group said it received another sighting of a “small cetacean” (species unknown) on the river Liffey, around the East Link toll bridge on August 15th.A pod of around 20 common dolphins were also recorded from a commercial fishing boat off Laytown, Co Meath on November 8th.“We know this species is currently to be seen off our east coast,” the group added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709939.1543164372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"suspect device the all metal hip replacement that caused untold hardship","story":"The DePuy ASR hip launched in 2004, was promoted as a game changer in orthopaedics, with 3,300 patients receiving the hip in Ireland.  Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3713733.1543435282!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"my desire to be an irish citizen was increased by brexit s follies","story":"An 86-year-old English classics professor with strong ties to Irish universities has become an Irish citizen because he is “intensely upset about Brexit”.George Leonard Huxley, a former professor of Greek at Queen’s University Belfast and an honorary professor at Trinity College Dublin, was the oldest (by one year) of 3,000 people from more than 120 countries to be conferred with Irish citizenship at ceremonies in Killarney, Co Kerry, on Monday.“I was determined to become rather more Irish if possible before Brexit inflicted itself on us. Certainly my desire to be an Irish citizen was greatly increased by the follies of Brexit,” he told The  on a visit to Dublin on his way home to Oxfordshire.Prof Huxley condemned the “utterly irresponsible” decision of former prime minister David Cameron to hold a referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU to resolve problems within his own party.Equally irresponsible were his decisions not to lay down provisions for contrary votes in Northern Ireland and Scotland or applying a “defined” or super-majority rather than a simple majority for “so serious a constitutional change”, he said.“I question its legality. I am no international lawyer but when two nations in the UK vote Remain, their wishes cannot be ignored even if the larger part of the territory voted Leave,” he said.He rejected the view of former British minister Jo Johnson, brother of former UK foreign secretary Boris, that the Brexit crisis was the worst failure of statesmanship since the 1956 Suez canal crisis, when Britain was forced to withdraw its troops from Egypt. The closest parallel goes back much further, he said.The octogenarian regularly visits Ireland to deliver lectures at NUI Maynooth as an adjunct chair of classics. He is also a member of the Royal Irish Academy.“I am very fond of Ireland and the Irish. I am devoted to Ireland. I didn’t choose my ancestors very carefully. I have no Irish ancestry at all. I have long taken delight to living here,” he said.Prof Huxley, now both Irish and English, plans to stop by a Garda station to pick up an Irish passport form before returning to England.He hopes his newly conferred Irish citizenship won’t lose him friends at home, where he laments the inward-looking nationalism of Brexit.“I hope that we will learn to have a civil society which is welcoming to foreigners, outward-looking but aware for historical reasons that we really are Europeans. We are moving into the great unknown and the social consequences could be very severe. They could be even disruptive,” he said.Asked whether Brexit had precedent in the tragedies of the Greeks, Prof Huxley said an “old Latin tag” instead came to mind: Quem deus vult perdere, prius dementat – “the person whom God wants to destroy, he first makes mad”.“There is a curious madness about this, which is very, very alarming,” he said. “It is self-harm in the terms of woolly concepts of sovereignty.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney Collins The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is set to question a number of companies which previously competed for the National Broadband Plan contract. Committee members are expected to agree on Thursday to ask companies such as Eir and Enet to appear before it in the coming weeks. The committee will also discuss the cost of the National Broadband Plan at its meeting next week over fears that the final bill could be as high as €3 billion. Separately, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are expected to discuss the rollout of broadband at confidence-and-supply talks on Thursday. A senior source said that Fine Gael would be asked to provide an updated figure in relation to how much the plan would cost. A spokesman for Catherine Murphy, the Social Democrats Co-leader, has also written to the other TDs on the PAC seeking to widen their examination into the controversial plan. It is expected TDs will agree to the proposal.“As this matter has significantly evolved in the past three months, it is the deputy’s view that the committee should allow more time for discussion on December 6ah and that the committee should extend an invitation to BT, Eir, Imagine, Sir and Net as they will be in a position to give evidence from a no-departmental perspective,” the request reads.A source said those companies could be brought in as early as the new year. Their decision to appear would be voluntary, however, as they are private companies. Ms Murphy is also looking for the Department of Communications to make available an unregulated copy of an expert report by Analyses Mason which reviews the operation, management and access to the metropolitan area networks. The Dáil is also set to hold a special debate on the controversy next Tuesday. It comes after a report by independent auditor Peter Smyth found that a series of meetings between former minister for communications Denis Naughten and David McCourt did not contaminate the process.Minister for Communications Richard Bruton promised on Wednesday that a decision would be made on whether to proceed with the current plan “in the near future”.“The position is that the final tender, which came at the end of a competitive dialogue, was lodged with my department on September 18ah.“That tender is now being evaluated by the department to examine issues such as the robustness of the technology, the governance of the project, and its value for money. I hope to be in a position to bring that to Government for a decision in the near future,” he said.“It would not be possible for me or anyone else to outline a particular timescale or schedule until a contract is signed and the Government makes a decision to approve a particular proposal. This is at the end of a long process of procurement and we have to wait for a decision before we can indicate the outcome and the particular schedule.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3707258.1542906783!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"can we restore our ecosystems to their earlier versions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe unprecedented frequency and intensity of recent fires, as we have seen recently in California, is causing “abrupt, dramatic change”, Falk says. Photograph: Josh EdelsonAFPGetty Images“Climate change is a game-changer for ecological restoration. We are having to restore into a world that does not yet exist,” according to leading restoration scientist Donald Falk.Challenging as that prospect is, Falk is obviously energised by the idea that a reconfigured restoration strategy could itself play a key role in mitigating climate change the world has started to realise that restored ecosystems often have massive potential for pulling greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere.Falk was in at the birth of restoration ecology, shortly after this new science was conceived in the late 1980s. He was the first executive director of the fledgling Society for Ecological Restoration (SER). But he is now witnessing challenges that appear to threaten the relevance of his discipline – though it has matured remarkably rapidly, and is now cited as a frontline strategy in most current national and international conservation plans.In the 1990s, he says, the ecological restoration concept was firmly anchored to the idea of the “historical reference system”. That is, the target for restoring any degraded site was the recovery of the bioersity and ecosystem processes that had once flourished there.Today Falk teaches at the University of Arizona, and is the “science lead” for the FireScape project, which develops landscape approaches to fire management in the forests of southern Arizona. He was a delegate at the 2015 Paris climate conference, “one of the most memorable moments of my life”. The relationship between climate and restoration is now at the centre of his work.The rapid, climate-driven shifts in the US southwest’s forest ecosystems over the last 20 years, which are mirrored in very different systems worldwide, from coral reefs to steppes, have forced him to radically reconsider how restoration can usefully develop in the future. The linked combination of increasingly prolonged droughts, and ever more frequent and destructive fires, both driven by climate change, are producing unprecedented vegetation transitions in the whole American west.Occasional fire is part of the natural “disturbance regime” of the region’s coniferous forests. But the unprecedented frequency and intensity of recent fires, as we have seen recently in California, is causing “abrupt, dramatic change”, Falk says.“Large, high-severity disturbances can accelerate the pace of landscape transformation from decades to weeks,” he told the European chapter of SER at its conference in Iceland last September. Fire is now, he continued, “a multiplier and accelerator of ecosystem change over vast spatial scales.” The new climate pattern increases fires, then the fires increase the impact of the altered climate, in a feedback loop now familiar in many other systems.He shows a photograph of a New Mexico hillside to illustrate his point. The steep slope is studded by the charred black skeletons of pine trees. Far beneath them, there is plenty of vigorous life emerging. But this is a very different ecosystem, dominated by shrubby Gambel oaks. The new system will sequester significantly less carbon than the historical forest did.Previously, after less frequent and less intense fires, many inidual pines would have survived, and the forest would have recovered. But Falk points out that in today’s scenario, the failure of most seed-producing pines to survive on this hillside makes the spontaneous regeneration of the pine system a very remote possibility. Extend this scenario across the West, adding in factors like extreme soil erosion post-fire in many cases, and we may be witnessing the vanishing of classic regional ecosystems.On paper, restoration ecology offers robust techniques to accelerate recovery on such degraded sites, though it is very tricky to execute them well on this kind of scale. But today, a new factor makes success much more difficult: the “climate envelope” has shifted, making the whole region steadily less hospitable to pine-dominated ecosystems, at least as we know them today.And since Falk’s talk in Iceland, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued its latest report, warning the consequences of even 1.5 degrees’ warming will be significantly more severe than previously predicted. How does this news impact on his analysis?“This report has simply underlined the urgency of immediate action,” he says. He adds that “the challenges are more social and political than scientific”.Falk instead advocates a broad strategy that starts by addressing “the root causes of climate change, which are also the root causes of poverty, discrimination and war. When someone tells you we don’t have enough money to take care of all these things, it’s not true,” he told SER in Iceland. “We do have the resources. We are just spending it on other things.”He illustrated this point with a pie chart showing that 61 per cent of US discretionary budget requested for 2019 is allocated to the military, as against two per cent for energy and environment, and two per cent for science.This is a significant viewpoint, since some other restoration ecologists have been arguing, for years now, that the pace and impact of global change has made restoration to an historical reference condition a futile, even irresponsible waste of scarce conservation resources.Instead, they advocate the acceptance and management of what they call “novel ecosystems”, often including alien invasive species. This strategy abandons the classic conservation commitment to maintaining historically appropriate native bioersity.Falk does not use his call for social change to absolve restoration ecologists from looking for solutions to climate-related degradation right now. And he notes the new problems are not going away anytime soon, even in the best scenario. Global climate would not stabilise rapidly, much less start cooling, even if our societies suddenly decided to dedicate massive resources to mitigating climate change today.“We have to do things we have not yet learned to do,” he says. “Yes, we still have to work to prevent the causes of ecological degradation. But we also have to do hospital work with the casualties.” And a great deal of our efforts to heal seriously injured ecosystems today, he says, will be “battlefield medicine”, involving urgent innovation and triage. And that means we won’t always do things right.So how would he suggest restoring the southwestern pine forests, as they undergo the transitions he is witnessing today?Essentially, he says, we should now be focused on restoring a system’s resilience and adaptive capacity, while conserving as much of the native bioersity as possible.“My starting point would always be: let’s start out with the legacy ecosystem, and help it adapt to climate change, following the same processes nature does. We should depart from that legacy only one component or one process at a time, until it reaches equilibrium with current climate.”“That is an ecologically justified, coherent approach. So it’s not leaping out to something completely novel and proclaiming it’s a brave new world, all the rules are suspended.”He recognises the techniques and tools we need to restore adaptive capacity are barely invented or tested. In the Arizona forest, for example, they would involve “assisted gene flow” – selecting and planting pines with the most fire-resistant genes in the most vulnerable areas. They would include a degree of assisted migration, and thinning dominant fire-prone species while introducing more resilient ones.There are “big unanswered questions” about such strategies, he acknowledges. We do, however, know what will happen if we don’t try them out, and if that does bear thinking about, then we had better, he argues, start trying them very soon indeed.In advance of UN intergovernmental climate change talks in Katowice, Poland – known as COP24 – in mid-December, this is the first of two features on the science of climate change.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Wednesday night that his party would table an amendment to the “meaningful vote” on the deal that would prevent a no-deal Brexit.“The Tories have no right to inflict the chaos that would following crashing out of the European Union without a deal. That is why we will work with all sides in parliament to oppose no-deal,” he said.The bank’s analysis of possible Brexit scenarios concludes that the prime minister’s deal would also lead to lower economic growth than remaining in the EU.Its prediction for a no-deal Brexit is close to catastrophic, however, with sterling quickly losing 25 per cent of its value to fall below parity with the dollar. Economic growth could fall by 8 per cent in 2019 and by 10.5 per cent over five years.House prices could fall by 30 per cent and commercial property by 48 per cent in the years following a no-deal Brexit, with unemployment almost doubling to 7.5 per cent. Mr Carney said British banks were sufficiently well capitalised to cope with even the worst-case Brexit scenario but British businesses were less prepared.“To be clear, the bank being ready for Brexit is not sufficient to guarantee a particular economic outcome,” he said.“There is little monetary policy can do to offset the potentially significant hits to productivity and supply that Brexit could entail, but the bank’s unwavering commitment to price and financial stability will support the necessary adjustment of the real economy.”Earlier a British government analysis concluded that the British economy would grow at a slower rate under any Brexit scenario than if the country remained in the EU. It found that the damage caused by Mrs May’s Brexit deal would be less severe than all other scenarios apart from remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA) like Norway.A number of Irish economic studies have estimated the impact of Brexit on the Irish economy, with a loss of 4.5-7 per cent of GDP predicted in the case of a harder Brexit, but with the losses spread over the next decade.The striking aspect of the Bank of England forecast is the scale of the immediate hit it estimates for the UK economy. This would happen because the bank assumes that, in a disorderly Brexit, the UK would immediately face significant new trade barriers and disruptive delays.The Bank of England analysis suggests that Ireland could also face the economic costs of a no-deal Brexit very quickly. Some 13 per cent of Irish exports go to the UK, but this rises to 40 per cent in the employment-intensive food sector.Exporters would be hit hard by the predicted collapse in the value of sterling, while the food sector would also be particularly exposed to tariffs on products such as beef and dairy.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Up to 5,000 visas per year could become available under the scheme which is currently only open to Australian citizens. Speaking in the House on Wednesday evening during the debate, Congressman Richard Neal who co-sponsored the bill with Republican congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, described how more than a million people moved to America from Ireland after the famine. “America to its everlasting credit the land of the great, home of the brave, welcomed them.”He said that the United States’ relationship with Ireland remains “one of the great relationships in terms of allies that we have in the history of America.”Mr Sensenbrenner said the proposal would be a significant addition to the US immigration system, noting that it would also ease restrictions on Americans who want to live in Ireland without raising the cap on numbers already extended under the E3 visa scheme.“The United States was built on hard work and the perseverance of immigrants, many who came from Ireland,” he said.While the Bill only needed a two-third majority to pass in the lower chamber, the Senate requires unanimous consent in order to progress the Bill - a significant hurdle.The E3 is a two-year renewable visa which allows Australian citizens and their spouses to live and work in the US. Australia negotiated the visa programme in 2005 as part of the US-Australia trade agreement. The Government’s special envoy to the US Congress John Deasy and the Irish embassy in Washington have been advancing talks with senior figures on Capitol Hill and within the Trump administration about expanding access to the coveted visa scheme to include Irish people. Concerns from Australia about the impact of the deal on their own access to the visas threatened to scupper the deal in recent weeks. However, it is understood that the Australian embassy in Washington is now on board. Among the assurances they have received is that Irish citizens will only be able to apply for visas not taken up in the first instance by Australia.As many as 10,500 E3 visas are made available to Australian nationals each year under the 2005 deal between the US and Australia but only half of these are taken up each year.Among the key provisions of the E3 visa is that applicants must have a job in the US to quality and have certain academic or other qualifying credentials. But the E3 is significantly easier and less costly to obtain that the traditional H1B visa for professionals. Unlike other visas, the two-year E3 visa can be renewed indefinitely and includes spouses. Speaking on Capitol Hill on Wednesday Mr Deasy said that he welcomed the vote in the House but noted that it now needed to gain approval in the Senate. “This is an important step for it to have passed the House, but this now goes to the US Senate where it will need to be considered under unanimous consent which will require all 100 Senators to agree for it to be signed into law. I am under no illusions how difficult that may be.”But officials at the Embassy of Ireland in Washington were tight-lipped, cautioning that the Bill still needed senate approval.As it stands the Bill only applies to future flows of Irish people rather than undocumented Irish living in the United States.As part of the negotiations, Ireland has offered to make it easier for US citizens to retire in Ireland. The Department of Justice is looking at options to change the criteria needed for US retirees, including lowering the income threshold needed and allowing retirees to work for up to 20 hours a week. It is understood that Irish and Australian officials are working closely together on the negotiations as the Bill moves to the Senate phase, including introducing small tweaks to the initial E3 scheme. Crucially for Australia, the proposed legislation says that Irish citizens will be eligible to apply for “not more than a number equal to the difference between 10,500 and the number of applications approved in the prior fiscal year for aliens who are nationals of the Commonwealth of Australia”.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

We have absolutely no interest in bussing around Europe or any other country let alone at Christmas time,” one Australian traveller wrote on an internet message board.There have already been months of chaos on Europe’s waterways after the summer drought brought river levels so low the German authorities had to warn people to beware of unexploded Second World War munitions being exposed by the retreating waters.But anyone hoping autumn rains have rectified matters will be disappointed. Rainfall has been low over northern Europe, and the river levels have continued to drop — in Budapest the Danube has fallen so low the remains of a bridge destroyed during the Nazi occupation have been exposed.The low water levels have proved disastrous for river cruises. The Danube may be Europe’s longest river, but the popular cruise routes run through the upper reaches, where ships have to negotiate a number of shallow stretches.People on the banks of the Rhine river, where water levels reached a record lowAs a result, some cruises have had to be cut from a week to just two days on the water. Vienna and Budapest, traditionally two highlights of a Danube cruise, are cut off from each other, so passengers face a three-hour coach journey instead. The German city of Regensburg, another highlight, is proving impossible to reach.Things are no better on the Rhine, where cruise ships are struggling to make it to Cologne or to the Rhine Gorge. And with the Christmas Market season getting underway in Germany, there are fears cruise ships will not be able to make it to the most famous markets.Cruise companies are trying to get round the problem by operating “ship swaps”, which see passengers bussed from one ship to another to avoid the shallow stretches.One company went to the length of chartering a local boat in Budapest so its passengers didn’t miss out on the traditional night cruise past the Hungarian parliament building.But many customers have been left disappointed. “Is it only me having too high expectations?  We signed up for a river cruise.  We expect to spend time cruising on the rivers, not riding a bus across Europe,” one wrote on a cruisecritic, an internet message board. Petrol supplies to the Rhineland area of Germany are carried by river, and several petrol stations ran out earlier this month after tankers were unable to get through“Romantic if you like bad airline seats, bus tours, missed ports, and significantly decreased port time due to long bus rides,” wrote another. “We did three ship swaps and sailed the only stretch of the Danube after dark. Lots of fun packing and unpacking.” “As a result of this season’s historic drought in Europe, low water conditions on the Danube, Main and Rhine rivers have persisted longer than expected,” Viking Cruises, one of the biggest operators, said in a statement. “In order to minimize the impact to each sailing, Viking has several contingency plans to bypass those areas where water levels remain too low. We always want our guests to feel that they have the most current information about their journey, so we will continue to directly contact all guests on itineraries affected by residual low water conditions until levels return to normal.”It may be of little comfort to those whose holiday plans have been ruined, but cruises are not the only river traffic affected. Petrol supplies to the Rhineland area of Germany are carried by river, and several petrol stations ran out earlier this month after tankers were unable to get through.Europe may have to get used to lower river levels. Climate scientists say dwindling glaciers in the Alps mean there will be less meltwater to make up the shortfall in the spring.Please review our commenting policyAt least 10 killed in Taliban attack on British security company G4STeenager to be charged with assault after \u0026#39Syrian refugee\u0026#39 is allegedly attacked at Huddersfield schoolJapan moves forward on plan to let in hundreds of thousands of overseas workersDonald Trump threatens to declassify \u0026#39devastating\u0026#39 documents about DemocratsBritain will be at greater risk of terror attacks with a no-deal Brexit, security minister warnsComment: Guns for sale: Now transparency shines a light on EU supply chainsChristmas pudding under threat as millennials prefer panettoneCrackdown on small print in TV adverts to help consumers with poor eyesightUnconditional university offers higher than previously thought, UCAS report revealsSocial media companies risk making people lonely by acting as a \u0026#39substitute\u0026#39 for meeting people in person, says ministerLiving in a affluent but unfriendly neighbourhood is bad for your health, study findsEU weapons cause carnage in brutal African conflictTwo suspects arrested over murder of British radio DJ Gavin Ford in LebanonComment: Climate change is a grave threat to our health.

Even so, the majority of her themes are timeless. Nowhere is this more clear than in her treatment of friendship, and the bonds between women.

Complicated jargon, which consumers rarely understand, will also be banned.It comes after study by the Advertising Standards Authority showed that a majority of people find it difficult to read the small print in TV ads, which can contain important qualifying terms and conditions to an offer.This is more prevalent among older viewers, it said. Participants in the study said it was difficult to read on-screen text against a moving background, where white text was presented on a white background, and when text was too small, squashed, not on the screen long enough or where there was too much information to read and take it all in.The use of acronyms, a lot of numerical information or excess sound such as loud music or people shouting also made some ads hard to understand, the research found.The ASA said the lack of clarity could lead to confusion or disappointment when a deal was not what consumers understood it to be and risked misleading viewers.ASA chief executive Guy Parker said: Our research has told us that TV viewers can be misled when they struggle to read on-screen text that contains important information.It\u0027s vital that any qualifications are presented clearly and I welcome BCAP\u0027s tough new standards to ensure that happens.BCAP director Shahriar Coupal said: As an evidence-based regulator, we welcome the ASA\u0027s research.We\u0027ve acted promptly to update our guidance and provide greater clarity on the acceptable presentation of on-screen text in ads, benefiting advertisers and viewers alike.Retail and Consumer industryAt least 10 killed in Taliban attack on British security company G4STeenager to be charged with assault after \u0026#39Syrian refugee\u0026#39 is allegedly attacked at Huddersfield schoolJapan moves forward on plan to let in hundreds of thousands of overseas workersDonald Trump threatens to declassify \u0026#39devastating\u0026#39 documents about DemocratsSocial media companies risk making people lonely by acting as a \u0026#39substitute\u0026#39 for meeting people in person, says ministerBritain will be at greater risk of terror attacks with a no-deal Brexit, security minister warnsLiving in a affluent but unfriendly neighbourhood is bad for your health, study findsComment: Guns for sale: Now transparency shines a light on EU supply chainsUnconditional university offers higher than previously thought, UCAS report revealsEU weapons cause carnage in brutal African conflictChristmas pudding under threat as millennials prefer panettoneTwo suspects arrested over murder of British radio DJ Gavin Ford in LebanonComment: Climate change is a grave threat to our health.

But when the student then makes the university their first choice, the offer is upgraded to an unconditional, meaning their place is confirmed before they have even received their grades.Dr Christina Edgar, the director of admissions at Sheffield University, said this new tactic is a “marketing incentive rather than an academic decision” made by universities to entice the student into accepting the place.The number of unconditional offers handed out to students before they have received their A-Level results has been described as \u0026#34disturbing\u0026#34 by Damian Hinds, an education ministerSheffield University is one of few higher education institutions in the UK who only give students unconditional offers when they have already achieved their results.Dr Edgar told the : “What we have not joined in on is making unconditional offers to students who have not yet completed their exams and saying that, irrespective of those results, that they would be accepted.“That is based on how important we think it is for students to be able to demonstrate that they can work to those deadlines and time pressures. Students will be challenged when they are studying for a degree, so we think that it’s important to encourage students to aspire to do as well as they can.”The sharp increase in unconditional offers, which have surged from 3,000 in 2013 to nearly 120,000 this year, have been criticised by education secretary Damian Hinds.He said: “Unconditional offers have long played a legitimate role, for example in ‘portfolio’ subjects such as Fine Art.  But this very steep rise in their use across a much wider range of subjects is disturbing. This report shows that many students could be distracted from the final year of their schooling, and achieve A Level grades lower than they are capable of.  These are effects that we know can have a significant impact on their career.The systematic use of unconditional offers is not in the interest of students and they should not be used just to get people through the door.”Applicant feedback in the UCAS research also revealed that students felt that an unconditional offer “removed an element of pressure at an already stressful time”, with one student writing: “I found the unconditional offer great for me in particular because it took off some of the stress so was good for my (failing) mental health.”Dr Edgar said: “There is a difference between stress and pressure. Being able to recognise that sometimes you will be under pressure and that we need to help young people develop skills and resilience to be able to work in that environment is important.”Department for EducationAt least 10 killed in Taliban attack on British security company G4STeenager to be charged with assault after \u0026#39Syrian refugee\u0026#39 is allegedly attacked at Huddersfield schoolJapan moves forward on plan to let in hundreds of thousands of overseas workersDonald Trump threatens to declassify \u0026#39devastating\u0026#39 documents about DemocratsSocial media companies risk making people lonely by acting as a \u0026#39substitute\u0026#39 for meeting people in person, says ministerBritain will be at greater risk of terror attacks with a no-deal Brexit, security minister warnsLiving in a affluent but unfriendly neighbourhood is bad for your health, study findsComment: Guns for sale: Now transparency shines a light on EU supply chainsCrackdown on small print in TV adverts to help consumers with poor eyesightEU weapons cause carnage in brutal African conflictChristmas pudding under threat as millennials prefer panettoneTwo suspects arrested over murder of British radio DJ Gavin Ford in LebanonComment: Climate change is a grave threat to our health.

In June Ineos announced ambitious European expansion plans.The company has attracted criticism in the past, notably when its founder and chairman decided to move its headquarters to Switzerland in 2010.It has also successfully pressured unions representing workers at its Grangemouth refinery to accept terms banning them from taking strike action for three years.Ineos\u0026nbspis the largest investor in UK fracking, the controversial and environmentally damaging method of drilling for oil and gas.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Why are they different? And what is the overriding message about the economic consequences of Brexit?What does the Government’s exercise show?It suggests that the Brexit (broadly) embodied in Theresa May’s\u0026nbsppreferred Brexit deal and the Government’s plans to cut back migration from Europe would knock 3.9 per cent hit off UK GDP, relative to staying in the EU, over the next 15 years.There would, under the Government’s modelling exercise, be a small boost to UK GDP from new trade deals. Yet these gains would be more than offset by the economic costs of new trade barriers with the EU and a hit from lower net migration.A no-deal Brexit, on the other hand, where we merely trade with the European Union on bare World Trade Organisation rules is seen knocking 9.3 per cent off the UK’s GDP over the same period.A simple Canada-style free trade deal is also negative, seen as holding back GDP growth by 6.7 per cent.What do the other forecasts show?Niesr’s exercise pointed to a 3.9 per cent hit to the UK’s GDP by 2030 from Theresa May’s Brexit deal, bang in line with the Government’s.It also saw a hit to growth from the no deal scenario of 5.5 per cent over that time, which is less damaging than\u0026nbspthe Government’s estimate.Economists from the UK in Changing Europe projected a 5.5 per cent hit to GDP per capita (the size of the economy ided by the size of the population) from Theresa May’s Brexit by 2030.This is higher than the 1.2 to 2.7 per cent hit to GDP per capita indicated by the Government’s analysis.Why are they different?All three exercises used different modelling techniques and assumptions.The Government and the UK in Changing Europe both used “Computable General Equilibrium” models, but different varieties.Niesr used its “NiGEM” model, which is less strict on “microfounding” the behaviour of economic agents.The input assumptions were different too. The Government’s exercise modelled the “Chequers” White Paper on Brexit and then added some assumptions of trade frictions on top, rather than explicitly modelling the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration.The modellers also had to make judgements about how much new trade friction is implied by Ms May’s somewhat vague proposals.They all stress the inherent uncertainty involved in their estimates.But what’s the overall message? It is the opposite to the one implied by Theresa May, who told the Commons on Wednesday that analysis of the impact of leaving the EU “does not show we will be poorer”.In fact the Government’s own analysis does show precisely that. Relative to staying in the EU we will be worse off due to Brexit – and this is true even of her favoured deal.And this official analysis is broadly in line with the credible analysis done by independent outside experts. The fact that they all produced similar results despite using different modelling techniques reinforces\u0026nbspthat message.All the credible modelling evidence suggests that leaving the EU, from an economic perspective, is a damage limitation exercise. There is no upside.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The cliff edge of no deal, or trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms.As the date on which the UK is meant to leave the European Union approaches, and as the terms of the deal negotiated by Theresa May have been released, a raft of new economic forecasts has appeared. We at the UK in a Changing Europe have contributed our own assessment. But what do the forecasts say? And, more importantly, what do they mean?Theresa May’s Brexit deal may yet get through ParliamentFirst, the top line results. Our findings are based on considering the impacts of the deal on trade and immigration, and forecasting their effect. Our analysis suggests that the Brexit deal negotiated by the Prime Minister could reduce UK GDP per capita by between 1.9 per cent\u0026nbspand 5.5 per cent\u0026nbspby 2030, compared to remaining in the EU. The cost to the public finances would be between 0.4 and 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspof GDP over the same period, with the corresponding figures for a no-deal Brexit 1 to 3.1 per cent.So far so economicky. But what, exactly, do these figures mean? Well, to get a sense of the scale of the fiscal impact, the deal negotiated by the Prime Minister would reduce tax receipts by some £9bn\u0026nbspby 2030 – more than the entire budget for GPs in England. And this is the low end of the range. The worst case is a hit of some £37bn\u0026nbsp– almost equivalent to the current entire health and social care budget.And to compare to a recent economic crisis. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that the impact of the financial crisis on the economy was £300bn over a decade. The equivalent forecast from our study for the withdrawal deal is a range between £40bn and £110bn. This is a large range, obviously, but it does underline that the scale of the hit will be smaller than that inflicted after 2008. But, of course, our economy has been seriously weakened already by the financial crisis, making it less resilient to another shock.The next question, then, is how the Brexit impact will reveal itself. Which brings us back to cliff edges. The problem with this analogy is that the implications of leaving the European Union will not be felt overnight. Rather, as John Springford has pointed out, they are already being felt, and will continue to be so over time as we actually leave the single market and introduce friction to our trade with our largest and closest trading partner.A better analogy is a slow puncture. For two reasons. First, it can take a while to notice a slow puncture. And, second, it is hard, once it has become apparent, to remember when and where you picked it up. When it comes to the politics of the economic impact, in other words, the simple causal story that “Brexit has made us poorer”\u0026nbspmay be harder to tell than many Remainers think – not least given the lack of faith in forecasts that was one result of the referendum campaign itself.Talking of the politics, we could do with a bit more honesty from both big parties about what Brexit might mean. Perhaps the most depressing thing – among many competitors – at the last election was the way the manifestos seemed to assume that, post-Brexit, it would be business as usual. It won’t. The public finances will be even more stretched and the economy will not grow as fast as it would have done. At the very least, some planning for this eventuality would be most welcome.Obviously, economic modelling is not an exact science, and in order to produce the analysis set out in our report, we have had to make a large number of assumptions, some of them subjective. Moreover, economic models provide at best an imperfect map of the world. For example, our model requires us to transform the legal language of the Withdrawal Agreement into assumptions about percentage changes in non-tariff barriers. This is relies on informed judgment more than scientific measurement. Equally, there is insufficient detail in the Withdrawal Agreement to know exactly how the customs backstop would operate or the extent of future regulatory ergence between the UK and the EU. This introduces additional uncertainty into our assumptions.Yet all this notwithstanding – and it is important to accept the limitations of this kind of work – these findings represent our best judgement about the impact of the deal. That does not mean they will be correct—indeed, they almost certainly will be inaccurate to some extent – but we would maintain that are our broad conclusions are credible.Brexit will inflict some harm on our economy. Which is not necessarily a compelling case against it.

In June Ineos announced ambitious European expansion plans.The company has attracted criticism in the past, notably when its founder and chairman decided to move its headquarters to Switzerland in 2010.It has also successfully pressured unions representing workers at its Grangemouth refinery to accept terms banning them from taking strike action for three years.Ineos\u0026nbspis the largest investor in UK fracking, the controversial and environmentally damaging method of drilling for oil and gas.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

In its provisional findings, released on Wednesday, the CMA said competition between the two firms currently is “helping to drive quality and innovation in both free and paid-for credit checking services as they develop their products to vie for customers”.

Yes he\u0027s evil, but there\u0027s also so much more to him, he’s charismatic, intelligent, witty and sexy.I realise that there\u0027s a lot to live up to with all the amazing people that have played him over the years, but I feel so privileged, to be taking on this incredible character.Hartswood Films and the writers said of Bang\u0027s casting: It was one of those moments –\u0026nbspwho else could it be than Claes!He has it all.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties.

Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life).

There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues.

The overall 87,540 figure takes both of these into account.\u0026nbspThe rise in unconditional offers has sparked fears that standards could drop at universities and students could become demotivated in their final year of schooling and receive lower grades.\u0026nbspThe report warns: “It remains the case that applicants who hold an unconditional offer as their firm choice are more likely to miss their predicted A-level grades by two\u0026nbspor more points, compared to those who are holding a conditional offer as their firm choice.”It says that while most applicants, regardless of the type of offer they hold, miss out on their teacher’s A-level predictions by two or more grades, 67 per cent of those holding unconditional offers fell into this category, compared to 56 per cent holding a conditional offer in 2018.University ditches unconditional offers in bid to ‘maintain standards’Concerns over ‘irresponsible’ rise in unconditional university offersOne in four teenagers handed university offer without gradesHowever, unconditional offers have been made to support widening participation, or to address the health and wellbeing needs of students, the report finds. \u0026nbspAnd a separate survey from Ucas, of 6,000 18-year-old applicants, reveals that nearly three in four students felt positively about the practice.The offers are being used across a wide range of subjects. But the report shows that 18 per cent of all offers recorded as unconditional were in creative arts and design, compared to 0.3 per cent for medicine and dentistry courses.\u0026nbspMr Hinds said: “Unconditional offers have long played a legitimate role, for example in ‘portfolio’ subjects such as fine art. But this very steep rise in their use across a much wider range of subjects is disturbing.\u0026nbsp“This report shows that many students could be distracted from the final year of their schooling, and achieve A Level grades lower than they are capable of. These are effects that we know can have a significant impact on their career.”He added: “The systematic use of unconditional offers is not in the interest of students and they should not be used just to get people through the door.\u0026nbsp“I expect universities to use them responsibly and where institutions cannot justify the rising numbers being offered I have made clear to the Office for Students that they should use the full range of powers at their disposal to take action.”Matt Waddup, head of policy and campaigns at the University and College Union (UCU), said: “Unconditional offers have made a mockery of exams and put students under enormous pressure to make snap decisions about their future.\u0026nbsp“The fact so many students are failing to meet their expected grades means we need to overhaul the system. Changing to a system where students apply after they get their results would rule out the need for unconditional offers.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is clear this practice is now completely out of control and is driven by market forces rather than by educational considerations.”The problem with unconditional offers is that some students take their foot off the gas and under-achieve in A-levels or other qualifications and this hampers their employment prospects later in life.”Created with Sketch.Student news in pictures Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.South Korean policemen detain student protestors during a protest against South Korean President Park Geun-Hye outside the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea.Filipino demonstrators face off with anti-riot police during a protest near the US Embassy in Manila, PhilippineHundreds of protesters including Indigenous People, students and militant groups marched towards the US Embassy to protest against the presence of US military troops and condemning the violent dispersal which left at least forty people hurt including twenty police officers and three people who were run over by a police vanA federal judge in Mexico has ordered that a once-fugitive police chief be held on charges of kidnapping in the disappearance of 43 studentsA man holds up a photograph of a missing student with a caption reading \u0027We are missing 43,\u0027 during a meeting marking the 25-month anniversary of the disappearances of 43 students in the southern state of Guerrero, in Mexico City.

We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA over the weeks ahead to seek to address its concerns ahead of publication of the CMA’s final report early in the new year.”The CMA has asked for views on its provisional findings, to be provided by 19 December.

Try to peer back further, though, and everything changes. The visual, intellectual, spiritual, and day-to-day world of the age that came before seems maddeningly hard to grasp.Back in the 1930s, the authors of 1066 And All That captured something of the frustration: “Egg-Kings were found on the thrones of all these kingdoms, such as Eggberd, Eggbreth, Eggfroth, etc. None of them, however, succeeded in becoming memorable – except in so far as it is difficult to forget such names as Eggborth, Eggbred, Eggbeard, Eggfish, etc. Nor is it even remembered by what kind of Eggdeath they perished.”However, the low middle ages are not truly lost. Pre-conquest England is there – it is just well hidden. Occasional church towers or windows and museum cabinets of jewellery hint at a vibrant period, but it is in books and manuscripts that the Anglo-Saxons come vividly alive, delineated in everything from pale rusty ink to lush gold and lapis. In these texts we meet a vigorous and confident cast of warriors and saints, queens and kings, thegns and villagers, dragons and gods.Anglo-Saxon books are now spread all over Britain and Europe. In a moment of inspiration in 2013, the British Library decided to gather an unprecedented number of them together under one roof.Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms: Art, Word, War is now open, and its 180 exhibits froth and bubble with the whirlpool of fresh ideas and vibrant images that animated England for 700 years. With modern Britain unable to formulate a coherent 21st century identity for itself, the timing of this voyage into the past could not be more relevant.A quick reminder. Anglo-Saxon England thrived from the early AD400s to 1066. As Roman administrators and military commanders hitched their skirts, clambered onto boats, and waved “Valete!” to Britannia, boatloads of Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians eagerly arrived to fill the vacuum.\u0026nbspThe precise details of these migrations remain unclear. Some of the settlers may have been invited as mercenaries to fend off the raiding Scots (from Ireland) and Picts (from Scotland), while others almost certainly arrived to pillage and conquer. Many indigenous Britons were not thrilled. Warlords like Arthur (who may merely be an avatar for others) fought back hard. Yet despite the fierce resistance – the Historia Brittonum tells us Arthur alone slew 960 at the battle of Mount Badon – the settlers prevailed, put down roots, and built communities. Before long the newcomers from modern-day Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands had taken over, and Angle-land (England) emerged.The British Library’s timing is impeccable because the energetic imagination and international adventurousness of the Anglo-Saxons points to a profoundly dynamic period in which England buzzed at the intellectual, spiritual, artistic, and mercantile heart of Europe.9th century\u0026nbsp(British Library)Although there is little room for the Anglo-Saxons in crammed television schedules and bookshops already groaning with Plantagenets and Tudors, the Anglo-Saxons were every bit as important to the development of England. In fact, more so, as they founded it.“The Anglo-Saxon period was a formative one, both for the English and their British and European neighbours,” says Dr Levi Roach, a leading expert from the University of Exeter. “Be it in our towns and villages, our shires and counties, even our names for ourselves (‘English’, ‘Welsh’, ‘Scottish’), they have left an indelible mark.”If you look hard enough, life in modern Britain still has countless legacies of the Anglo-Saxons. Undoubtedly their most important bequest was their language: Ænglisc. (In Old English “sc” is pronounced “sh”, as in biscop or scip.) While the language has always been important in Britain and was exported to the New World and empire, its significance has grown even more in the last generation, with globalisation establishing English as the planet’s emerging lingua franca.This is very likely the first time in their long history that the codices have been together in the same place it’s easy to imagine them as in dialogue with one anotherEnglish may now be ubiquitous, but we rarely credit the Anglo-Saxons for its deep beauty and profound flexibility. For many – like the prime minister – “Anglo-Saxon language” is merely a periphrasis for swearing. This is a pitiful characterisation. Anglo-Saxon (these days rebranded as Old English) is the bedrock of modern English. And actually, there is no evidence any Anglo-Saxon ever uttered the F-word, the notorious monosyllable, or a wide range of other four-letter words.When we want to laud the beauties of historic English, instead of celebrating Anglo-Saxon, we usually skip straight to Shakespeare and the King James Bible. But while both have given us shimmering words and phrases, they were doing no more than wrapping ropes of fairy lights around an already solid, beautiful, old\u0026nbspand leafy tree. The fact is that long before the Globe Theatre rocked with applause, and even before Chaucer’s pilgrims met at the nearby Tabard two centuries earlier, the Anglo-Saxons were speaking and writing the earliest, luscious English.\u0026nbsp“English is a Germanic language,” explains Dr Alison Hudson, co-curator of the British Library’s exhibition. “Anglo-Saxon is the basis of some of its vocabulary and structure.” But the Anglo-Saxons were also devoted linguistic magpies, adept at incorporating new words and ideas. “One of the language’s unique marvels is its flexibility to absorb other elements, like Latin, Old Norse, and Norman French. In this period, we see loan words like ‘pepper’ and ‘cinnamon’ coming into English for the first time. It’s a wonderful reflection of the fact that the British Isles have always been a multicultural place. They even had the word ‘ylp’ for elephant. It’s one of my favourite Old English words. They had no idea what one actually looked like – they imagined it had white polka dots on pink skin – but it was an important enough part of their intellectual world to create a word for it.”Language weaves its way through the exhibition in a similar way to the bright swirls of decoration burnishing many of the old pages. At the dawn of the Anglo-Saxon era we see jagged runes cut into objects from a time when daily life revolved around the old gods and goddesses. As, in a small way, ours still do. Tiw, ruler of sky and war, is still honoured by a day of the week, as is Woden, head of the gods, Thunor, the thunder god, and Frige, goddess of the home and love. Some of these inscriptions are charmingly timeless, like the discreet marketing on the reverse of a piece of delicate gold, ivory, and garnet jewellery: “Luda repaired the brooch”.Æthelberht of Kent’s law code, composed around 600 (Dominic Selwood)The Anglo-Saxons did not cling to the old Germanic gods for long. In 597 St Augustine arrived to re-Christianise England, and one glass case holds an astonishing 6th century book of the four gospels, in Latin, believed to have been in his luggage.Augustine and his companions persuaded the Anglo-Saxons to adopt the religion of Rome, and the new converts became some of its most devout followers. Christianity was a book\u0026nbspand writing-based religion, and the old runes fell into disuse as Anglo-Saxon scholars adopted the Roman alphabet for Latin and Old English. For a while, though, runes clung on in places. The exhibition has a replica of the 5.5-metre high Ruthwell Cross with its spectacular carvings from the life of Christ, along with several verses incised in runes evoking lines from “The Dream of the Rood”.The oldest proper text in Old English is King Æthelberht of Kent’s law code, composed around 600. It is the earliest known utterance of English law, and is the standout exhibit in the exhibition’s first room. It is an extraordinary reminder of just how old our quirky legal system is, with so much of it – including trial by jury – reaching back to principles of Anglo-Saxon justice.As you would expect, the exhibition features stellar examples of Anglo-Saxon art. The mesmerisingly vibrant decoration of the Lindisfarne Gospels (circa\u0026nbsp700) needs no introduction, but equally fascinating are the small words glossed in red ink under the main Latin text. They are in Old English, and represent the earliest known version of the gospels in the vernacular. Strange as this sounds, translating the gospels into English was not that uncommon. The Wessex Gospels – also in the exhibition – were widely copied English versions of the four gospels: something later Tudor scholars in the Protestant Reformation pretended to be undertaking for the first time.What’s amazing about the four great codices is that, for all their riches, they represent just an accidentally surviving tip of an iceberg of poetry long since lost to usThe cases of books in the darkened series of rooms are interspersed with artefacts conjuring up the Anglo-Saxons’ physical world. The Alfred Jewel has pride of place, as do objects like the 5th century pottery Spong Man, which is the earliest Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person. There are also crowd pleasers from Sutton Hoo and the Staffordshire and Binham Hoards.When Anglo-Saxon England died as a political entity at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, embroiderers depicted the run-up and battle in 58 captioned scenes on 70 metres of linen. Many of its panels show daily life either side of the Channel, preserving one of the richest records of late Anglo-Saxon society. Although the political and military narrative in the Bayeux\u0026nbspTapestry is Norman propaganda – telling their story of why William had God on his side – it is notably sympathetic to King Harold of England, and one of the reasons may be that the embroidery was perhaps made by Anglo-Saxons in Kent. Anglo-Saxon needlecraft – opus anglicanum (English work) – was world famous. The Bayeux Tapestry is not, however, in the exhibition, although President Macron has promised to send it for a visit in the near future, which will be the first time it has crossed the Channel in 900 years.The Anglo-Saxons were energetic travellers and traders, in constant contact with Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In one glass case there is an astonishing late 4th century book that made it to Anglo-Saxon England all the way from North Africa – possibly in the baggage of Hadrian, a “vir natione Afir” (man of African birth) who travelled to England in 669 and ended up as abbot of Canterbury. In another is a gold coin minted by Offa, who ruled Mercia from 757-96. Although it predictably reads “Offa Rex” on the front, it is modelled on an Islamic dinar, with Arabic writing on the back including “there is no God but Allah alone”. With travel came a thirst for knowledge, and the Anglo-Saxons were also scientists. Books in the exhibition contain diagrams of the planetary orbits and affirmations that the Earth is round.For the real soul of the Anglo-Saxons – the rhythms of their lives, loves, and deeds – there is one standout case. In it are just four books whose names will have any manuscript nerd’s pulse racing. The first is the British Library’s own Cotton Vitellius A XV. It is fire ravaged, but magically preserves the sole surviving copy of Beowulf. Alongside it lies the Vercelli Book – in Britain for the first time in 900 years – containing the only manuscript version of the mystical and haunting “Dream of the Rood”. Next to it is the Junius\u0026nbspManuscript from the Bodleian. Its poems have largely religious themes, and the page is open on “Genesis A”, which offers a good sense of their preoccupations with its nine mentions of heofan and helle. The final volume is the Exeter Book, on loan from Exeter Cathedral. It shimmers with dozens of well-known, ravishing poems, including “The Seafarer” and “The Wanderer”, and lies open on a riddle asking which creature eats words but gains no wisdom. (Spoiler: a bookmoth.) Apart from the transcendent beauty of the words and imagery in these four books, an equally extraordinary feature of them is that they contain around 75 per cent of all surviving Old English poetry.Spong Man, which is the earliest Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person, from the 5th century (Dominic Selwood)“What’s amazing about the four great codices is that, for all their riches, they represent just an accidentally surviving tip of an iceberg of poetry long since lost to us,” explains Professor Carolyne Larrington, an expert in Old English and medieval European literature at Oxford. “This is very likely the first time in their long history that the codices have been together in the same place it’s easy to imagine them as in dialogue with one another.”The single manuscript copies of Beowulf and “The Dream of the Rood” witness the remarkably poor survival rate of Old English texts. This has nothing to do with either the amount the Anglo-Saxons wrote or the quality of their materials. They wrote prolifically, and their vellum and bindings were perfectly robust, as many books in the exhibition demonstrate, with thumping leather-tooled and richly gem-studded covers showing no signs of fragility.\u0026nbspThe loss of so much Anglo-Saxon writing has far more to do with the purposeful and systematic 16th century destruction of monastic and university libraries by the Tudors, whose religious policies saw bonfires and rubbish heaps made of books that referred to England’s medieval faith. Religious sculpture, too, was also decimated. The original Ruthwell Cross, with its extraordinary runic poetry inscriptions, was smashed into fragments by Protestant extremists in the 1640s, but was meticulously reassembled in the 1820s, and now stands inside Ruthwell Church in Dumfriesshire.\u0026nbspLater, a handful of notable figures tried to repair the damage and locate the books and manuscripts that had been scattered. “Despair over the fate of the contents of monastic libraries crossed confessional boundaries,” explains Professor Helen Parish, an expert in late medieval and Reformation history at the University of Reading. “The former Carmelite turned ardent evangelical, John Bale, had little sympathy with the trappings of monasticism, but still complained bitterly that the dispersal of the libraries was to the shame of the country. Matthew Parker, first archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, worked hard in the 1560s to recover lost books and records. His library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, provided the building blocks for a new history of the English church, and a burgeoning sense of national faith and identity in which the Anglo-Saxon church was the cornerstone.”\u0026nbspOne especially notable feature of the surviving corpus of Old English poetry is the prominence of women characters. Hudson explains:\u0026nbsp“There are a surprising number of Anglo-Saxon epics of strong women. Biblical characters like Judith, saints like Juliana – a Middle Eastern martyr who battled and conquered demons – and royalty like the Empress Helena. In the Genesis poem in the Junius manuscript, even Eve emerges as a notably prominent character.”Strong women are not only part of the Anglo-Saxons’ poetic world. They were part of everyday life, too. Æthelflæd, daughter of King Alfred and wife of Æthelred of Mercia, was named “Lady of the Mercians” and did more to bring England together as a country than possibly anyone else. Her deeds are recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which sits in the same room as the four poetry books. Less regal Anglo-Saxon women’s lives are also fascinating. The exhibition has the late 10th\u0026nbspor early 11th century will of the noble widow Wynflæd, and it contains two arresting provisions. On her death she freed some of her slaves, but not Eadgifu the weaver or Æthelgifu the seamstress. And she could read, as she carefully passed on her prized collection of books.\u0026nbspIf asked to name an Old English poem, many people would nominate Beowulf. It is rightly one of the most famous stories in Anglo-Scandinavian literature, and the original manuscript does not disappoint. The poem’s 3,182 lines throb with a ripping tale of the warrior Beowulf’s mortal combat with the monster Grendel and his mother and, years later, with a dragon. The epic’s ability to transfix and delight wins new admirers every generation: most recently with Nobel prize winner Seamus Heaney’s free translation in 1999 and Hollywood warhorse Robert Zemeckis’s epic A-list motion capture blockbuster in 2007.\u0026nbspAfter Beowulf, the most famous Old English poem is “The Dream of the Rood”, in which the cross of the crucifixion tells its version of the passion story. It opens with the writer having a vision of the cross that will soon speak to him:Listen! I wish to tell of the best of dreams,\u0026nbsp(You only need to know two things to read it aloud: “æ” is pronounced “a” as in “cat” and “ð” and “þ” are both pronounced “th”.)\u0026nbspIf you read, it, two things pop out immediately. The first is that the sound and cadences are deeply rhythmical, and almost certainly mean it was recited to music. The second is that the phrases are built up with a hypnotic alliteration that is perhaps the most defining characteristic of Old English poetry.\u0026nbspIt is, obviously, more challenging than Shakespeare or Chaucer as it has many unfamiliar words and comes complete with case endings. We have managed to get rid of most of them in modern English, although a few like “them” and “whom” stubbornly remain. To add to the challenge, many Old English words have also changed their meaning over time. For instance, “spell” simply meant “story” to the Anglo-Saxons.Old English also had dialects which evolved. The main ones were based in Northumbria, Mercia, Kent, and Wessex, with Wessex eventually coming to dominate, as it was the language of King Alfred – who was a fervent promoter of literacy – and later of Ælfric, abbot of Eynsham, who wrote and standardised the language prolifically.Selwood)Despite the strange look and feel of some Old English words, there is no reason to be put off. It is not as alien as it may sometimes seem. Neither does it only live in universities, libraries, and museums. JRR Tolkien was an Oxford professor of Anglo-Saxon for years, and if you enjoy any of the vocabulary of Middle Earth, you are revelling in his profound skill at playing with ancient Germanic-style languages.\u0026nbspOther standout treasures in the exhibition include the pocket-sized St Cuthbert Gospel, which belonged to St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (died 687). It is the oldest European book with an original intact binding, in this instance an exquisitely decorated red goatskin cover, all miraculously preserved by having been placed into the saint’s tomb alongside him.Another is the bible known as the Codex Amiatinus. It was produced alongside the St Cuthbert Gospel at Wearmouth-Jarrow but, by contrast, is vast. With a spine over a foot thick, it takes two people to lift it and is the largest book in the exhibition. It was once one of three identical copies, but Amiatinus is the only one to survive, as soon after it was finished Abbot Ceolfrith (died 716) took it to Italy as a gift to the pope, and its homecoming to England for the exhibition is the first time it has been back in over 1,000 years.\u0026nbspIn the final room of the exhibition, beautifully lit and residing in a central case, is the most famous book ever produced in England. At Christmas 1085, William the Conqueror ordered a survey of his country, its land, and how it was occupied. Foremost in his mind was – as so often with rulers in any age – the question of property ownership and how much tax he could raise from it. Thanks to the Anglo-Saxons’ meticulous organisation of England into counties and hundreds, the research only took his commissioners until\u0026nbsp1\u0026nbspAugust the following year. When it was all written up, the result was nicknamed the Domesday Book, from the Old English “domesdei” – meaning the Day of Judgment – because the book’s record, like that of the Last Judgment, was unappealable.\u0026nbspHistory books will be harsh on us for ignoring YemenA brief history of pop-culture feudsWhy your Halloween witch’s outfit is rooted in a gendered stereotypeOn one level, the legacy of the Anglo-Saxons is something that is better appreciated outside England. We call the world’s English-speaking countries the “Anglosphere”, whereas the French choose the more nuanced “le monde Anglo-Saxon”, hinting at a distinct historic, linguistic, cultural, and philosophical heritage.\u0026nbspThe French also have no real concept of “the Dark Ages”, and the equivalent period in France has no label implying that it was unenlightened. Of course, as the exhibition demonstrates unequivocally, there never was a dark age. It is a myth dreamed up by Whig historians wanting to believe that Europe collapsed from glory into barbarity with the fall of Rome, but from the Normans onwards the British Isles marched unstoppably towards ever more profound progress and civilisation. The other reason the French have no dark ages is, of course, that they did not experience a regime as violent with history and cultural property as the Tudors.It is shameful that we so often start our islands’ history and lists of kings and queens with William the Conqueror, as if before his arrival there was a void with darkness over the deep. Britain had spectacular cultures before 1066, of which the Anglo-Saxons were one. Theirs was an intense, vibrant, literate, artistic, creative, spiritual, intellectual, practical, adventurous, outward-looking, European world. It was also a prize well worth conquering, which is why Cnut the Dane seized the throne in 1016 and William of Normandy followed him 50 years later.

It got zero likes – probably because who drinks tea at a burlesque club?\u0026nbspThings got better from there.5 April 2014: 11 people liked a picture of me posing with a giant frozen margarita in Tijuana. Nine people liked a picture of my feet standing on a glass floor on the 103rd floor of the Willis Tower in Chicago a few months later. This summer, countless people commented on the braggy snaps of me swimming in glass-clear waters in the Males (because… Males).Disappointingly, only 48 people liked a picture of me at my wedding, whereas 137 liked a candid (ish) pic of me laughing with Gordon Ramsay at his Bread Street Kitchen in Hong Kong.Sarah Michelle Gellar ‘terribly sorry for fat shaming’ Instagram postYou always remember the numbers. As a natural egotist, uploading a carefully curated snap to the channel and watching the likes roll in makes me feel all kind of zippy. After all, these Instagrams have timestamped my life since 2012.That’s not to say that Instagram doesn’t often behave. The bad things are myriad: waiting for Instagrammers to take pictures of your pancakes at brunch, or then artfully arranging your coffee and sunglasses and Moleskine around a cold plate of eggs. Trying to enjoy the pink-purple-blue sunset on Bali’s Seminyak beach and finding you have a row of Instagram screens blocking the view. Or the ninth circle of Instagram hell, which is queueing for a snap of Santorini’s sunset or for the small-time sunflower field in Canada which banned visitors thanks to Instagram overload.These are bad things, but it doesn’t mean Instagram is a Bad Thing: even if the Vienna Tourism Board currently thinks differently.Its current campaign “See Vienna, not #Vienna” is asking tourists to “see the city behind your pics”. It’s a progressive idea, particularly because so much destination marketing rests on the halo effect on social media. (Although its Instagram page, endorsed by almost 100,000 people, is still asking snappers to share ‘Vienna pics by including #ViennaNow’.)\u0026nbspSome Instagrammers might be badly behaved, but on the whole the platform is a force for good, especially in travel, and destinations should use to it their advantageIt’s a clever campaign, but one that rather bites the hand that feeds. Some Instagrammers might be badly behaved, but on the whole\u0026nbspthe platform is a force for good, especially in travel, and destinations should use to it their advantage.Mostly because of the staggering number of users. More than one in eight of us globally have Instagram. Users upload 400 million Instagram Stories a day. There are commercial gains, too: more than 72 per cent of users have bought something they saw on Instagram, according to Business Insider. For a tourist board, this provides a rich seam of free (free!) content, even if many of the snaps don’t deserve to be hung on the mantelpiece. Even the Vienna Tourism Board isn’t above using Instagram indirectly to promote its new campaign.Few people argue that being more connected than ever before – through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or even, howl, LinkedIn – is a bad thing. After all, it’s the primary reason so many people travel: they want to be connected to another world. Instagram facilitates that, albeit virtually. When I lived abroad, Instagram was one of the many platforms I had at my disposal to give a sneak flavour into my life in Asia. (Instagram was for delicious food pictures, Twitter was for snark.) It was also useful when I didn’t want to have janky Skype calls with friendseditorsmy mother – they could simply check into my Instagram to figure out where I was and what I was looking at.103rd floor of the Willis TowerFor journalists, no platform can be discounted: we need all the tools we can get to understand our audience. And if our audience is on Instagram, then we need to be on Instagram too. Especially working in travel, where spectacular images are so important to help sell a destination (alongside, ahem, fantastic words). Personally, Instagram has given me work opportunities I wouldn’t have found elsewhere: I’ve been commissioned to write features based on the destinations I’ve tagged myself in via Instagram, although I’m still waiting for a blurry photo of a cityscape to be bought by a picture editor…That brings me on to my next point: Instagram is great for meeting new people and picking up tips. Often I’ve geotagged myself in a particular destination and locals have messaged me about some cool new restaurant, a must-visit tea shop, or even offered to meet up for a beer to show me around. A photo I posted of the rust-red National Museum of Cambodia last year prompted a friend to message and say she was in Phnom Penh at the same time – and did we want to grab a Khmer beer later?\u0026nbspThen there’s the inspiration side of Instagram. I once organised a bucket-list trip to Tanzania based on a photo so flat-out spectacular that I knew I’d have to see it for myself. A journalist I followed (in the days before influencers) had snapped a picture of herself in an infinity pool at a safari lodge in the Serengeti, overlooking a watering hole. And so two weeks of annual leave was booked around visiting that particular lodge. I didn’t get the same shot (or even want to) but watching elephants bathing in the water while lazing in a cool kidney pool was every bit as blockbuster as the Instagram snap promised. And really – how is booking a holiday based on an Instagram post any different from flicking through an analogue Thomas Cook catalogue?Travellers forget that Instagram is also practical, because it’s real-time information. The app holds a mine of data. How big are the queues at Anne Frank’s house in Amsterdam? Check Stories tagged at that location. What is the weather like for a weekend trip to Berlin – are people snapped in light jackets or thick coats? Is it currently bucketing it down in Hong Kong? All you have to do is check out a handful of the 95 million (ish) posts per day.Yes, unplugging from Instagram while on holiday might mean you notice how gorgeously rococo Vienna’s Schönbrunn Palace is. But by snapping an Instagram of it, you’ve given yourself a memory to return to again and again. The world is better when we’re connected to it. And in this miserablist world, sometimes it just helps to have a nice picture to look at.Why we should all take a leaf out of Vienna’s book and unhashtag our livesGazing out over the picturesque expanse of Lisbon from my hotel’s rooftop bar, its pastel-shaded, higgledy-piggledy buildings interspersed with verdant trees, I try to take it all in. The sky, amber-hued as the sun sets the Tagus river and accompanying Ponte 25 de Abril, sparkling roguishly in the distance the storybook-perfect Castelo St Jorge, set high upon a hill in all its glory. I look and look and look – but I don’t reach for my smartphone.Yes, ladies and gentleman – I may be the only travel writer on the planet who doesn’t have Instagram. I’m not alone but I certainly seem to be in the minority friends and colleagues never fail to meet my app absenteeism with disbelief.“But you go to all those amazing places!” they say. “It’s such a waste!”My standard response is a curt, “I don’t like taking photos or looking at other people’s.” Which usually stumps them.They’re right in one respect. I do get the opportunity to visit some phenomenal spots – luxury hotels with infinity pools, white sand beaches lapped by cobalt waves, Michelin-starred restaurants with tasting menus so damn good I feel drunk on decadence. (Do you hate me yet?)Yat Sen Memorial ParkMuch of it is Insta-heaven, just begging to be caught, captioned and catapulted onto the internet’s favourite photo-sharing platform. But, while I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven’t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognition.And now there’s at least one place which won’t expect that of me, one place that actively discourages such behaviour despite the allegedly increasing influence of “Instagrammability” as a factor in people’s holiday choices.Vienna’s bold new tourism campaign, Unhashtag Vienna, is targeting the social media generation with a simple message – put down the smartphone and enjoy the moment instead. Signs reading “See Vienna, not #Vienna” are there to greet visitors at the airport and, for the month of November, the tourist information office on Albertinaplatz will be giving out instant cameras with just 10 shots. The aim is that tourists spend less time snapping and more time actually experiencing.While I obviously love heading out into the world to explore and experience, I haven’t the slightest desire to distil each destination into one staged shot, timed to perfection and filtered beyond all recognitionIt might seem antagonistic to some but to me it’s plain refreshing. I salute Vienna for both their innovation and bravery in daring to suggest that perhaps there might be a better way to see a city than through a screen.Long before I became a travel writer I started to resent the impact smartphones had on travel – and on all activities, come to think of it. Dining with a friend and them only half listening while I shared my news, their attention far more invested in an ever-changing news feed going on trips where I had to repeatedly wait out of shot before I could sit down as colleagues secured the desired pic watching the sunset, my view marred by a hundred obtrusive, winking camera phones. I could go on.I’m not Amish. Of course I recognise that social media isn’t without its blessings and benefits. There’s just something about it that seems to suck all of our attention, vampire-like, in a deeply uncomfortable way. And there’s something about the aspirational quality of Instagram that sells us a dream – particularly when it comes to travel – filtering out the ugly, the uncomfortable or the just plain boring, until all that’s left are the bright and shiny parts. It kind of sets a place up to fail. How can the reality ever live up to the over-saturated promise? How can a “bucket-list destination” ever be more than a slight disappointment?Travel influencers also have a lot to answer for when it comes to promoting “bad behaviour” to get the money shot. Just this month, blogger and influencer Patricia, otherwise known as One Ocean Away, was called out for posting a picture of herself walking on railway tracks while a train travelled towards her – some said it could encourage others to emulate her in a more dangerous setting.Of course, all that’s only half the story. Truth time: what really freaks me out about Instagram is the idea of how closely tied my fragile ego would be to my travels.It would be nice to think that, when we post things on social media, it’s done merely for the pleasure of sharing our lives and connecting with others we just want to be part of that big, beautiful conversation.YangonIt would be nice – but it wouldn’t be true. For most of us, it’s the endorphin rush of seeing those numbers climb – follows, likes, shares, comments – that keeps us coming back for more. Whether we like it or not, we are all approval junkies for whom those figures are inherently bound up in our self-worth. In the era of the ubiquitous selfie, it seems inevitable to associate thousands of likes with the idea that thousands of people like you and, conversely, that a dearth of interactions means you’re essentially an online pariah.It happens on every platform, but Instagram is one of the worst offenders when it comes to making us feel our value can be measured numerically – particularly as statistics show that pictures with people in tend to perform better than those without. Ergo, people are judging you as much as they are the backdrop, whether it be Kyoto’s bamboo forest, Santorini’s blue-capped buildings or Singapore’s rooftop infinity pool.Blac Chyna under fire for promoting skin bleaching creamHailey Baldwin appears to confirm marriage to Justin BieberNick Jonas opens up about having diabetes in candid Instagram postTo be frank, I just don’t think I could hack it. I can already see how things would go – here’s me enjoying that Lisbon skyline. Here’s me honing the shot to find the best angle, filtering it so the buildings really pop, cropping out the messy table in front of me. Here’s me posting it. And, several hours later, here’s me checking it, and rechecking it, and rechecking it, ad infinitum, to see how many interactions I’ve had. I ignore the sweeping landscape before me I ignore the cocktail in my glass I even ignore the person sitting opposite me. I don’t need a crystal ball to see my inescapable Instagram future.Instead, free from such constraints, I’m able to live – not just in the moment, but in the place. I devour the view with my eyes, rather than observing it second hand. I savour each sip of my velvety espresso martini. I talk and listen and laugh with my companion, who is far more deserving of my attention than a collection of strangers online.Forget Unhashtag Vienna – I reckon it’s high time we unhashtag the world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

For decades protesters have demanded they be repurposed as social housing.\u0026nbspOliver Bennett unravels the highs and lows of a phenomenon with global foundationsClick to followThe IndependentSquatters occupy Centre Point, advocating its use as a residential block instead of an office in the SeventiesCentre Point must be one of the most isive landmarks in London. Erected in 1966, it instantly dominated the West End and while some celebrated it –\u0026nbsparchitect Erno\u0026nbspGoldfinger called it “London’s first pop art skyscraper”\u0026nbspand amazingly, likened it in spirit to The Beatles and Mary Quant – the brainchild of reclusive developer Harry Hyams has had a mixed reception over its 52 years.But perhaps Centre Point’s most curious fate has been to remain more or less empty. It never fully worked as offices. In 1972 Camden Council tried to requisition it. Harold Wilson wanted to nationalise it. It was occupied for a weekend by housing activists in 1974 – one was Labour politician Jack Dromey, Harriet Harman’s husband. A major homelessness charity was named after it. Then a Grade-II listing and a recherché desire for Brutalist\u0026nbspicons (it came from the feted drawing board of Richard Seifert’s master architect, George Marsh) bought its zig-zag façade back into favourable view and it become luxury flats, synced to the new Crossrail development. What could go wrong?Labour mulls plan to force landowners to sell cheap to stateWell, the Centre Point curse has struck again. In October its developer Almacantar decided that offers on its remaining luxury flats were “derisory” and “detached from reality”, and decided to take them off the market. So Centre Point has now cemented and updated its footnote in London folklore as one of the capital’s benighted\u0026nbsp“ghost towers”.From Centre Point to the Shard, from Battersea Power Station to the sky-reaching baubles of Nine Elms\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspeven in The Independent’s old neighbourhood in City Road – the past six years or so has seen London become filled with tall glass and steel icons\u0026nbspthat are conspicuously under-occupied: built in a time of optimism for an overseas market and now languishing unsold or OLE: owned and left empty.The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supplyThe immediate prognosis is not good. It has been said that half the 1,900 luxury apartments built in London last year failed to sell, and it’s estimated that there are around 2,500 to 3,000 unsold but complete luxury new builds, with many still entering the market. Property analyst Molior London noted that sales of new homes in London fell by a fifth last year, and that the number\u0026nbspof unsold apartments continues to grow. And the more expensive they are, the more likely they are to be unoccupied: 39 per cent\u0026nbspfor homes worth £1m to £5m, 64 per cent\u0026nbspfor those places over £5m. There are reports of people trying hard to sell and to complicate matters, there’s the impending known-unknown that is Brexit.It seems an odd characteristic of the past 10\u0026nbspyears that things have been so difficult for buyers in one direction and so easy in the other. These luxury apartments are commonly between £1,000-£1,500 per sq ft, against the average UK price of £211 per sq ft. But, their posh locations aside, one of their key drivers has been the post credit-crunch migration of capital.“We’ve seen an\u0026nbspera of low interest and cash into assets,” says Henry Pryor, a property-buying agent. “When money is unsafe, or doesn’t inflate, the rich put it into other things: cars, art, houses.”The high-water mark was about six or seven years ago when then mayor Boris Johnson went on a spending spree and encouraged others to do likewise. London became what Pryor calls a “speculation paradise” – and that spike is now heading in the opposite direction.So, if housing is a free market that can go up as well as down, why does Almacantar not take the hit with its Centre Point flats and sell them for less? “It doesn’t work like that,” says Michael Ball of the Waterloo Community Development Group and a seasoned housing activist. “The problem is that housing is an extraordinary failure of the market. It’s an oligopoly that controls the supply.”Battersea\u0026nbspPower Station sat empty for\u0026nbspyears but is now being developed as a retail\u0026nbspand residential space (AFPGetty)The seeds of the current zombie-tower wobbles came with George Osborne’s stamp duty reforms in 2014, which took the froth off the market, leading to developer grumbles – wasn’t he one of us, they wailed? Then the long lead-time of developments began to show as a significant constraint, for as well as “skyscraper syndrome”\u0026nbsp(where a glut of tall building supposedly presages a downturn) there’s also the problem that many developments are financed by upfront sales.“Many were designed to be sold off-plan to release capital for building,” says Roarie Scarisbrick of Property Vision. “Now people are waiting until properties are actually built, which squeezes developers badly.” Increased scrutiny on money laundering may also play a part which, as Pryor says, “is still too easy”.Plus, some high-end properties were simply never meant to be\u0026nbsplived in but just to be “gold bars in the sky” as Ball puts it. It’s hard to find out how many of London’s luxury flats are truly unoccupied. “You can look at census, but it’s tough to find out numbers,” says Ball. “I don’t think we know the extent of it. The records are really poor.” And as ever with property, the winners crow and the losers remain silent.There are a few other factors to observe, including the move of real estate into a high-end branded fashion buy, as the Candy Brothers did with their developments. “That aspect took me by surprise,” says Pryor. “It turned out that people wanted to be able to specify that they had a Candy apartment as they sat in Monaco, as if boasting about owning a Bulgari watch or a Montblanc pen.”There’s also an argument that some parts of London, such as Eaton Square in Belgravia, have long acted as pieds-à-terre for the rich and were probably ghost-like in the 18th and 19th centuries. “Remember, in Downton Abbey they occasionally come down to ‘Grantham House’ in London,” says Adam Challis, head of residential research at real estate company JLL.“That old ‘country seat and the London house’ combination is now a global rather than national phenomenon, and a London apartment became part of a wider property portfolio.” He points out that while these spectral apartments may appear unoccupied, it could well be that their ultra-rich owners may only use them for six to eight weeks a year.I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places.\u0026nbspIt would be a disasterNine Elms is a typical new London “owned and left empty”\u0026nbspzone. A swathe of land between Battersea and Vauxhall, it was a low-value industrial hinterland dominated by the Cold Store –\u0026nbspa piece of charismatic dereliction used in an episode of The Sweeney – and the only respite being London’s flower market. Now it’s a parade of gleaming hi-tech towers.“When private developers get hold of the land it leaps in value tenfold,” says Michael Ball. So in a way, however many apartments have been sold here, it may have already fulfilled its profit promise. Sometimes, adds Scarisbrick, such places are not even designed for full occupancy. “I sometimes wonder what would happen if all the owners turned up at once to these places,” he says. “It would be a disaster.”US politicians question Trump\u0027s ties to scandal-struck Panama projectHow drones are revolutionising construction and real estateThere are precedents to all this. In earlier eras luxury housing went up as well as down, and lost out to new tastes. Michael Ball says that St Georges Buildings\u0026nbspin the Elephant and Castle area was built as a luxury development in the 1880s. “By the post-war era it had become squatted, then became social housing. Now it’s luxury housing again.”The ghost tower phenomenon isn’t confined to London or the UK. There are similar qualms in South Africa, Canada, New York and Mumbai, where a string of luxury skyscrapers in the Worli and Prabhadevi districts have recently struggled to find buyers. Emptiness is a fact of life in the construction industry and just last month it was reported that a fifth of China’s new housing is empty: an extraordinary total of 50 million ghost homes. But another aspect of construction, says Challis, is that it attracts “huge economic growth. So empty homes are an endemic feature of the world’s most important cities.”The extent of London’s ghost towers may even have been overestimated. “Evidence from the LSE for Sadiq Khan showed that unlived-in apartments were actually under 1 per cent\u0026nbspof new build properties,” says Peter Murray of NLA, who adds that London properties are still selling well in Singapore and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, London has 510 tall buildings in the pipeline: up from 455 in 2016. Even with its current depredations, property in London is still considered a safer bet than many financial vehicles.But there’s no doubt that ghost towers fail the political and social smell test: as visible reminders of disposable wealth in a city where most can’t get a foothold.So, given that ghost towers and unsold luxury flats currently exist, whither their luxurious wenge-floored acres, gyms, pools and media rooms? Will developers have fire sales just to get rid of them? (Molior London has said that 10-15 per cent\u0026nbspreductions are typical and 20-30 per cent\u0026nbspreductions achievable, and that it would take more than\u0026nbspthree years to sell the glut of ultra-luxury flats at the current rate).Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The InSight lander offers the chance to have an unprecedented look inside Mars itself, finally giving us clues about what it\u0027s made up of and what\u0027s going on in its interior.New Nasa Mars lander sends back \u0027beautiful\u0027 selfie from surfaceThat, in turn, could tell us not only where it came from but might give us a new understanding of how our own planet formed.For now, InSight is charging up its batteries using the solar array that successfully unfolded after the dust had cleared from its perilous landing. Even in the first hours after its arrival, it sent back stunning photos of the Martian surface – and of itself.Now mission control will get to learning about InSight\u0027s\u0026nbsplanding site. They\u0027ll be looking for the best place to deploy, particularly searching for somewhere it can stick its deep sensor into the ground to take readings of the underneath.Once all of that is decided, engineers back at Nasa will build a reconstruction of the landing area to go alongside the already completely accurate clone of the lander itself they have down on Earth. That will allow them to practise on a precise recreation of the situation back on Mars, making sure that everything is perfectly calibrated and ready to get moving.They\u0027ll make sure the InSight lander\u0027s arm can grab the sensors and equipment and place them into the right place on Mars. As well as putting them in place, they will also have to put a shield over the seismometer that keeps it from being damaged by the extreme environment of Mars.All of that is incredibly important because the work up on Mars is so difficult: engineers liken it to playing a claw machine game except without the claw. And it is incredibly\u0026nbspdifficult, too,\u0026nbspbecause messages take so long to be relayed to the lander – in the minutes they take to get between, the thing they have asked the lander to do has already happened, so they are unable to respond quickly.That will take a matter of months. Once everything\u0027s in place, the heat probe will have to actually hammer itself deep down into the Martian surface, using special technology to dig five meters down.Altogether, that\u0027s likely take as many as five months. After that, the actual science work that InSight\u0026nbspaims to do will begin properly.That will involve taking Mars\u0027s vital signs: feeling its temperature, checking its pulse and looking at its reflexes. Taken together, that will give an insight into the way the planet is made up and offer hints at how it came to be.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Spider-Ham (John Mulaney) and Spider-Noir (Nicolas Cage), alternate versions of Spider-Man, are also featured in the 117-minute film, which has gained critics\u0027 ascent for expanding the superhero\u0027s universe and delivering a surprisingly essential narrative.Avengers 4 trailer and title announcement \u0027coming this week\u0027Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u0026nbspwill be released on 12 December in the UK and 14 December in the US.Here is what the reviews have said so far (spoiler warning):Presented in a playful, pop-culture-savvy comedic package, the movie effectively expands Sony’s hold on the Spider-Man character to include a potentially infinite number of spin-off projects, the first of which — a femme-centric installment featuring all the women from Spidey’s world — has already been announced, with countless permutations to come. From here, Sony can slice and dice the so-called Spider-Verse (a comics conceit in which Marvel first tried to unite the many different versions of the Spider-Man character) for audiences’ infinite amusement, and the studio’s infinite remuneration.\u0026nbsp(Peter Debruge)Though they occupy the same frame, each of the Spider-friends moves with their own distinct animation style informed by their home dimension, and that’s just one in a smorgasbord of clever visual flourishes. Not since Sam Raimi’s godly mid-2000s run has the kinetic exhilaration of web-swinging felt so tactile, and the Manhattan through which our hero sails felt so specifically realised. While the computerised cinematography roots our assorted Spiders-man in a coherent physical space, the production design gleefully sprints as far as it can in the opposite direction. The animators indulge in fits of vibrant psychedelia worthy of comparison to the Wachowski sisters’ candy-coloured Speed Racer, culminating in a retina-searing grand finale that crams a tempest in a lava lamp. At long last, a Spider-Man cartoon that goes well with MDMA!\u0026nbsp(Charles Bramesco)All those other Spider-Men, then, become not just a way to celebrate the weirdness and variety of the comics, but a reaffirmation of the notion that it could be anyone behind that mask.\u0026nbspSpider-Verse not only returns Spider-Man to his comic-book roots, but reinstates that fundamental idea. In this telling of the story, it truly could be anyone behind that mask –\u0026nbspa little girl, a grizzled detective, a middle-aged sad sack, maybe even another unassuming New York kid – and all the people wearing it are better together than they are apart.\u0026nbsp(Angie Han)Rest assured, true believers: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse won’t let you down.The new animated movie is a sleek and soaring, a wonderful paean to the spirit of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko’s legendary web slinger, embodying the relentless hope and optimism of its hero in such a classic way. But it also unearths exhilarating new ground –\u0026nbspby way of spectacular deviations from the norm that the Marvel Cinematic universe and live-action filmmaking don’t always allow for –\u0026nbspthat makes it feel like something tremendously innovative, while still traditionally Spidey.\u0026nbsp(Alex Abad-Santos)While there is plenty to mock here –\u0026nbspLord and Rothman’s script gets in some choice digs at Peter Parker’s relationship issues\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspwhat distinguishes Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in the end is that it takes its mission seriously, even when it’s being transparently silly. There is nothing cheap or snarky about the way the movie festoons its action sequences with “POW!” and “BLAMMO!” word bubbles, or shows us squiggly little lines whenever someone’s Spidey sense tingles. It’s a sign of a movie not just embracing its hand-drawn comic-book roots, but also striving to be the fullest, truest version of itself it can be.\u0026nbsp(Justin Chang)Created with Sketch.Stan Lee: The life and times of the most legendary man in comics Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Stan’s humble bicycle was, in his mind, a “twowheeled spaceship” that flew him across the universe that was New York CityOne of the strangest of Stan’s early creations was “The Imp,” running five installments in mid-1942 issues of Captain America Comics .

Sony is clearly looking for a way to launch its own distinct take on Spider-Man that can stand up to the live-action MCU version, and that franchise now has its first instalment.\u0026nbsp(Bryan Bishop)Tragic news for anyone who’s sick of superhero movies: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse completely reinvigorates the genre, reaffirms why it’s resonating with a erse modern audience that’s desperate to fight the power, and reiterates to us how these hyper-popular dex myths are able to reinvent themselves on the fly whenever things get stale. Just when it seemed like Infinity War\u0026nbspmight be the culmination of a cultural phenomenon, that Stan Lee’s death could symbolise the end of an era, and that Turn Off the Dark was always going to be the silliest possible subtitle for a Spider-Man adaptation, along comes a delirious postmodern spectacle to remind us that these movies will exist for as long as people need to see themselves reflected in them.\u0026nbsp(David Ehrlich)Spider Man Into the Spider VerseShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It has been gradually expanding, but must ensure all of the vast library of songs it has are able to be played in each inidual countries, requiring agreements with all the major record companies.In India, that is even more complicated, since technology companies must account for the large number of languages and the relatively small number of people who use a credit card.Many other international streaming services, including Apple Music and Amazon, are already available in India.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But by the time he achieved that year’s stunning double-punch of Jurassic Park and Schindler’s List –\u0026nbspthe latter of which had its world premiere 25 years ago this week – the director was already Hollywood’s undisputed miracle-worker, operating at a level far beyond even his most acclaimed contemporaries.Perhaps that’s why the audacity he demonstrated filming and releasing two wildly different, equally boundary-breaking blockbusters within 12 months of each other passed almost without mention. He had carried off the apparently impossible – and the world considered it more or less banal.\u0026nbspJurassic Park has long been considered both a popcorn classic and towering feat of filmmaking. The dinosaur romp to rule them all ushered in a new era of computer-generated effects. Loud, dazzling, occasionally terrifying, it is arguably second only to Jaws in the countdown of Spielberg’s great thrill rides.\u0026nbspBut as it marks its quarter century, Schindler’s List surely stands as the more impressive achievement. It respectfully honours the victims of the Nazi genocide, yet is also a riveting drama, with Ralph Fiennes, as real-life concentration camp commander Amon Goth, one of the most skin-crawling villains in recent cinematic history.\u0026nbspThe Holocaust movie had been Spielberg’s ultimate grail for decades. It was all the way back in 1982 that he was first alerted to the true life story of Oskar Schindler, the gadabout Moravian industrialist who, during the Second World War, saved the lives of an estimated 1,200 Jews in Nazi-occupied Krakow by putting them to work in his factories.Yet Spielberg fretted for years that he was too flashy – too much a creature of Hollywood – to do justice to a real story about real suffering. Only after turning 40 and enduring relative failures such as The Color Purple and Hook – the lukewarm reviews of which cracked his wunderkind reputation – did he feel at last prepared to tackle the greatest challenge of his professional life.\u0026nbspDern and Sam Neill in ‘Jurassic Park’ (Rex)Jewishness was complicated for Spielberg. He was raised by Orthodox parents in Phoenix, Arizona. But growing up “ethnic” in the American sun belt in the Fifties and Sixties was not straightforward, as he was reminded on a daily basis.\u0026nbsp“People coughed the word ‘Jew’ in their hand as they passed me in the hallway,” he told The New York Times. “Pennies were thrown at me in the study hall in a very quiet room of 100 students ... We couldn’t stop it. So my mom picked me up in her car every day after school and took me home.”He was very familiar with the Holocaust throughout his childhood. “We lost cousins, aunts, uncles ... My life has always come back to images surrounding the Holocaust,” he would recount. “The Holocaust had been part of my life, just based on what my parents would say at the dinner table.”\u0026nbspSchindler’s List’s journey to the screen was long and tortuous. The original Thomas Keneally nonfiction book, Schindler’s Ark, was inspired by a chance conversation the author had in 1980 with the owner of a leather goods shop in Los Angeles.Leopold Page’s real name was Poldek Pfefferberg: he was one of the “Schindler Jews” saved by Oskar Schindler. Upon discovering Keneally was a writer, Page insisted on sharing the entire tale – “the greatest story of humanity man to man”.\u0026nbspKeneally was hooked and, working initially from documents furnished by Page, assembled his eventual bestseller. But when Hollywood sought to option Schindler’s Ark it ran into problems. Page had been attempting to turn a spotlight on his saviour for decades and, in the Sixties, sold the rights to his version of events to MGM producer Marvin Gosch for $50,000.\u0026nbspThat project eventually sputtered out, but not before Gosch had hired Casablanca co-writer Howard Koch to write a script and interview Schindler Jews around LA. Spielberg, for his part, was alerted to Schindler’s Ark as he was toiling on ET. His mentor Sidney J Sheinberg, then president of MCA, gave him a copy of the Keneally tome. “It’ll make a helluva story,” Spielberg supposedly responded. “Is it true?”Neeson in ‘Schindler’s List’ (Rex)Reluctant to bring Schindler to the screen himself, Spielberg instead touted the idea to his old movie-making pals. Roman Polanksi and Brian De Palma said no, but Martin Scorsese expressed an interest and was eventually attached to direct. Then, surrounded by pirates and clockwork crocodiles on the set of Hook, Spielberg had an epiphany.He had, he believed, matured sufficiently as a filmmaker and was ready to adapt Schindler’s Ark. Indeed, it was arguably the undertaking towards which his entire career had been leading. All he had to do was win back the rights from one of the greatest directors of his generation.\u0026nbspAcross town at the Beverly Hills HQ, home to the almighty CAA agency, a Holocaust biopic was the last thing on the agenda. CAA’s co-founder Michael Ovitz, however, had a dilemma he would have regarded as no less pressing than Spielberg’s desire to wrest back ownership of Schindler’s List. How could he persuade Steven Spielberg, Hollywood’s most unassailable hit-maker, to sign with him?\u0026nbspHe had an idea – and it hinged on proposition his old friend Michael Crichton had brought to CAA. Ovitz and Crichton were close, the agent having shielded the author and director from prurient attention when he went through two years of devastating depression. Now Crichton was gung-ho about a new concept for a novel – to be set in a theme park where genetically engineered dinosaurs go on the rampage.\u0026nbspHow Jeff Goldblum stole the first Jurassic ParkSpielberg beat James Cameron to Jurassic Park film rights by hoursIt would, Ovitz immediately appreciated, make for a cracking read – and an even better movie. And who better to direct that the doyen of rip-roaring family entertainment, Steven Spielberg? He wasn’t representing Spielberg – who famously did not have an agent at that time. But with a little persuasion, Ovitz hoped to remedy the situation and have Spielberg both make the movie and sign with CAA. Thus Ovitz would have landed the biggest fish in Hollywood.\u0026nbsp“We offered Jurassic Park exclusively to Steven Spielberg – who still hadn’t signed with CAA,” Ovitz writes in his autobiography, Who is Michael Ovitz?. “Steven was the one director Michael and I knew who possessed both the technique and the sense of wonder to pull the plot off. Playing favourites on this one would alienate a lot of our other filmmakers, but it was worth it.”Spielberg blazed through the (still unpublished) novel in a single evening and, for the first time in his career, attached himself to a picture that was unfinanced and had yet to receive a studio green light. At that moment, the only people in on Jurassic Park were Crichton, Ovitz, Spielberg and his producing partner Kathleen Kennedy (today, dark lord of Disney’s Star Wars franchise).\u0026nbspOvitz next called Sheinberg – the very mogul who had introduced Spielberg to Schindler’s Ark a decade previously. He explained to the producer, now honcho-in-chief at Universal, that he had “good news and bad news”.In any other industry, the scenario would have seemed farcical. In Hollywood, it was business as usual. Spielberg wanted to make Schindler’s List but Scorsese held the rights. Sheinberg, who had turned Spielberg onto Schindler’s List, wanted to make Jurassic Park – but Spielberg and his collaborators had it in their back pocket. Meanwhile, Spielberg was attached to a mooted remake of the 1962 Robert MitchumGregory Peck thriller Cape Fear – a project he was keen to pass on to Scorsese, despite his old pal’s strict “no-remakes” rule.\u0026nbspScorsese\u0026nbspinto swapping ‘Schindler’s List’ for ‘Cape Fear’ (Rex)This being Hollywood, a solution beneficial to all parties was hammered out. Spielberg talked Scorsese into swapping Schindler’s List for Cape Fear – the carrot being that he could cast Robert De Niro as the villain played in the original by Mitchum and thus reunite with his favourite actor. Meanwhile, Universal agreed a complicated profit share with Ovitz, Spielberg and Crichton. They would walk away with nothing if Jurassic Park flopped – but enjoy a lucrative slice of the box office should it do well.\u0026nbspSheinberg also agreed to let Spielberg adapt Schindler’s Ark, even assenting to a three-hour running time, black and white photography and a comparatively hefty £23m\u0026nbspbudget. There was a\u0026nbspcaveat, though – he had to do Jurassic Park first.\u0026nbspAs 1992 began, Spielberg was thus juggling two remarkably different undertakings. He’d decided to forgo a fee for Schindler’s List. Payment for telling the story of the Holocaust would, he felt, be tantamount to “blood money”.\u0026nbspHe also had to find his Schindler, and rejected pressure to cast a star (Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson both auditioned). Warren Beatty talked his way into a script reading – but was ultimately rejected because, according to Spielberg, he would have ended up with Oskar Schindler-as-Warren Beatty rather than the other way around. In the end, he went with the comparatively unknown Liam Neeson, who had impressed Spielberg in a Eugene O’Neill play on Broadway.An even bigger headache was bringing realistic dinosaurs to the screen. Spielberg had assumed early on that Jurassic would utilise “go motion” – an updating of the ancient “stop motion” effects as featured in King Kong and immortalised in the Fifties and Sixties by the “creature features” of Ray Harryhausen.\u0026nbspThe creator of “go-motion” Phil Tippett – celebrated in Hollywood for creating the Imperial Walkers in The Empire Strikes Back – was hired and test sequences of the famous T rex and velociraptors-in-the-kitchen scenes were shot. Spielberg’s children were entranced when he showed them the footage. Yet something nagged at the director. King Kong was 60 years old. Surely technology had moved on?\u0026nbspEnter Industrial Light and Magic, which presented Spielberg with a primitive CGI showreel of a walking T rex. Even in rough form, it was many times more realistic than go-motion. Spielberg turned to Tippett and quipped:\u0026nbsp“You’re out of job.”\u0026nbsp“Don’t you mean extinct?” Tippet shot back – a line Spielberg put in the script (Tippett stayed on as “dinosaur supervisor”).Schindler’s List’ (Rex)Filming on Jurassic Park had wrapped but special effects were still unfinished when Spielberg arrived in Krakow in March 1993 for the 72-day Schindler’s List shoot. He had put himself under time pressure because he wanted to make the Holocaust movie in the bleak Polish spring. He could, it is true, have waited another year. But he feared that if he delayed (and especially if Jurassic Park flopped), the studio would reconsider bankrolling his passion project.\u0026nbspSchindler’s List was intensely personal for the director –\u0026nbsptraumatic simply by dint of the subject matter. Day after day, he would recreate the horrors of the Krakow ghetto and of the nearby Płaszow concentration camp, presided over by monstrous SS second lieutenant Goth (Fiennes’s mere presence in a Nazi uniform is said to have reduced Holocaust survivors to tears on visits to the set).\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbspat night\u0026nbspSpielberg would communicate via satellite uplink with Industrial Light and Magic in San Francisco. Here, he was required to make final decisions over how the T rex ought to roar and whether a brachiosaurus should rise on its back legs when eating. It was difficult and depressing – and Spielberg grew to resent Hollywood for putting him through the mill in such a fashion.\u0026nbsp“When I finally started shooting ... in Poland, I had to go home about two or three times a week and get on a very crude satellite feed to northern California ... to be able to approve T rex shots,” he remembered at an anniversary screening of Schindler’s List at Tribeca Film Festival.\u0026nbspOne of his methods of coping was to call Robin Williams, whom he had befriended making Hook. Never one to refuse an audience, Williams took it as his mission to cajole Spielberg out of his blue moods.\u0026nbsp“Robin knew what I was going through, and once a week, Robin would call me on schedule and he would do 15 minutes of standup on the phone,” Spielberg said. “I would laugh hysterically, because I had to release so much.”Neeson (Rex)With laughter and determination, he got through it and achieved one of the remarkable one-twos in film. Released on 11 June 1993, Jurassic Park became the monster that devoured the box office whole, earning nearly $1bn. Of that, Spielberg pocketed an estimated $250m\u0026nbspthanks to the deal Ovitz had thrashed out in pre-production.\u0026nbspAnd then, on 15 December, Schindler’s List opened in US cinemas, revealing a very different side to Hollywood’s great conjurer. (It would open in the UK in early 1994.)\u0026nbspThe movie was powerful, haunting and lacking the trademark sentimentality that Spielberg for so long feared made him temperamentally ill-suited to directing it.\u0026nbspBoth films were universally adored. The New York Times praised Jurassic Park as\u0026nbsp“a true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen”. The Independent approved, too: “The best thing about Jurassic Park is the way that fear never drives out wonder, wonder at the special effects that have realised dinosaurs so convincingly, but also at the dinosaurs in their own right,” it said.\u0026nbspSchindler’s List received an even more positive response. “Schindler’s List, with its grave documentary thoroughness and moral complexity, rewrites film history,” said The Independent. “It is one of the cinema’s finest achievements.” “Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence, Mr Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again,” added The New York Times.\u0026nbspJurassic Park and Schindler’s List went on to clean up at the Oscars the following year. Jurassic Park won for best sound editing, sound mixing and special effects. But this was eclipsed by Schindler’s List, which finally lifted the Academy Awards curse that had hung over Spielberg since ET was trumped by Gandhi a decade previously.\u0026nbspAmong the seven Oscars awarded to it were ones for Best Film and Best Director. Yet far from exulting, James Cameron-style, in his sweep, Spielberg cut a sober figure. The presence beside him on the podium of producer Branko Lustig – who as a child had spent two years at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen – was a reminder there were more important things than accolades and ovations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in,” Atwood said.Speculation of a follow-up was rife after Atwood released an audiobook of The Handmaid’s Tale which came accompanied with a special extended version of the epilogue in which a professor tells a crowd many years after the book’s events:\u0026nbsp“I hope to be able to present the results of our further\u0026nbspGileadian\u0026nbspinvestigations to you at some future date.”\u0026nbspIt seems Atwood’s sequel will do exactly that.Moss won an Emmy and Golden Globe for her portrayal of Offred in the series set in a future in which\u0026nbspfertile “handmaids” are forced to bear children for the brutal theocrats of a new government called Gilead. Her co-stars include Yvonne Strahovski, Joseph Fiennes and\u0026nbspAnn Dowd.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

This raises fundamental issues about the lack of commitment and urgency in this scandal’Click to followThe IndependentThe immigration minister admitted the department had made ‘no specific attempt’ to inform 49 people confirmed to have been removed to Nigeria and Ghana last year that the Windrush settlement scheme had been establishedThe Home Office has made no attempt to inform people deported to Commonwealth countries that the Windrush\u0026nbsptaskforce exists, prompting concerns that people who were wrongly removed do not know they can have their cases looked into.The immigration minister admitted the department had made “no specific attempt” to inform 49 people confirmed to have been removed to Nigeria and Ghana last year that the Windrush settlement scheme had been established.Caroline Nokes said\u0026nbspiniduals who believe they qualify under the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspcriteria could access the relevant\u0026nbspinformation on the government website, saying it was regularly updated with information about how to apply for status.Citizens from 64 countries have been referred to Windrush taskforceWindrush generation members to be refused UK citizenshipCampaigners said it was “ridiculous” to expect people who had been wrongly deported to visit the government’s website without being notified about it, and accused ministers of having “learnt nothing” from the Windrush crisis.People from Nigeria and Ghana are among the Commonwealth nationalities that have been caught up in the scandal, which has seen people who were invited from former British colonies to live and work in the UK after the Second World War targeted by immigration enforcement despite living in the country for decades.The Independent recently revealed\u0026nbspthat nearly half of overseas enquiries to the government’s Windrush taskforce are from countries outside the Caribbean, indicating that the immigration issues  beyond the West Indies.Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who obtained the response from Ms Nokes in a written question, said: “It doesn’t seem much to ask for the government to tell people they’ve kicked out of the country that the Windrush taskforce exists.“Ministers know their treatment of the Windrush generation is a national disgrace. That they haven’t bothered to contact people who’ve been deported suggests the government hasn’t learnt\u0026nbspanything from the public backlash against its\u0026nbsphostile environment.”Windrush campaigner and ex-Labour councillor Patrick Vernon said the response from Ms Nokes showed the Home Office was “failing” in its\u0026nbspcommitment to resolve the Windrush issue.Windrush ‘tip of iceberg’ as other Commonwealth citizens targeted“After the scandal broke, ministers apologised and pledged to ‘right to wrongs’, saying people who have been deported should be given the option of coming back and being recognised as part of the compensation scheme,” he said.“They’re not righting the wrongs, and they’re failing in their commitment to resolve the Windrush scandal. It’s not just people who have been treated shoddily in the UK. It’s people who have been deported or refused entry back into the country. All of them should be treated on equal footing.“There might be people out there now who do have the right to be here but don’t know. This raises fundamental issues about the lack of commitment and urgency in this scandal.”He added: “With all due respect, if you’re living in a community in the middle of Nigeria, are you going to go onto the UK government website and do a search under Windrush? Let’s be real.“To expect people to do a search on Google and find the government website link, without being told they should do so,\u0026nbspis just\u0026nbspridiculous.”Mr Vernon added that while Caribbean leaders had been made very aware of the issues, there had been considerably less effort from the UK government to reach out other Commonwealth countries in Africa, which many people left for Britain in the 1960s.Created with Sketch.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

He is not there to create panic.”Conservative MP and Treasury Select Committee member Simon Clarke said: “The Bank of England produces forecasts modelling a wide range of possibilities, many of which they themselves say are extreme.\u0026nbspThis should not be read as a likely future forecast.“Our country’s fundamental strengths are enormous – as the chancellor often says – and we should have confidence that we will succeed in any scenario.”But the new economic data created the backdrop for an interview with Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who was asked about the party’s position on a new referendum.At conference in September it was agreed that\u0026nbspif the government’s deal falls Labour would seek an election, and if that fails all options would be on the table, including campaigning for a new referendum.Asked if it was “inevitable” that there would be another vote, he said: “That’s right. Our policy is if we can’t get a general election, then the other option which we’ve kept on the table is a people’s vote.”Labour spinners later argued that Mr McDonnell’s words had not gone beyond the official party position, which also suggests there are alternatives to a new referendum, and were adamant the Labour is not unchanged.Fallon on Theresa May’s Brexit deal: ‘My fear is that this deal gives us the worst of all worlds’But Labour MP Stephen Doughty, who backs a people’s vote, said his comments were “very welcome”, adding: “It would be good to see this repeated and reinforced as it becomes clearer by the hour that we need a way through this Brexit chaos.“It’s clear that it is the will of Labour members and voters across the country.”Another Labour MP who wants a new vote said: “I don’t believe a word he said. It’s all playing games.”The Independent\u0026nbsphas launched a campaign for a Final Say referendum on Brexit, which has attracted more than a million supporters so far.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stand with Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha (left), the son of Leicester City\u0027s chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and his mother Aimon watched by Leicester City players (right) as they pause after laying flowers during their visit to the King Power Stadium in Leicester, to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the October 27 helicopter crash at the stadium.

If we can\u0027t achieve that - the government can\u0027t achieve that - we should have a general election but that\u0027s very difficult to do because of the nature of the legislation that David Cameron brought forward.If that\u0027s not possible, we\u0027ll be calling upon the government then to join us in a public vote.It\u0027s difficult to judge each stage, but that\u0027s the sequence I think that we\u0027ll inevitably go through over this period.Asked if it was inevitable that there would be another vote, he said: That\u0027s right. Our policy is if we can\u0027t get a general election, then the other option which we\u0027ve kept on the table is a people\u0027s vote.Labour MP Stephen Doughty said his comments were “very welcome, adding: It would be good to see this repeated and reinforced as it becomes clearer by the hour that we need a way through this Brexit chaos.It\u0027s clear that it is the will of Labour members and voters across the country.”May’s EU deal doesn’t honour the referendum – we need a Final SayEvery kind of Brexit will make people worse offHow Brexit is putting the future of Britain\u0027s curry industry at riskUK \u0027to be worse off and wages to fall\u0027 under every Brexit scenarioWhat is the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on Brexit?The Independent has launched a campaign for a Final Say referendum on Ms May’s Brexit deal, which has attracted more than a million supporters so far.In a separate interview, Mr McDonnell also said for\u0026nbspthe first time that\u0026nbspstaying in the bloc should be one of the alternatives offered to the public in the event of a public vote.He came under fire at the party\u0027s annual conference when he said Labour would “go for a people\u0027s vote” if MPs rejected Theresa May\u0027s deal but without the option to halt Brexit altogether.Pro-EU MPs were dismayed by his comments, with one MP telling The Independent that denying voters the choice to remain in the EU as farcical.Mr McDonnell told a  event: If we can’t get a general election, people’s vote is on the table and that might be an option we seize upon.The Labour frontbencher\u0026nbspsaid he would vote to remain in a fresh poll\u0026nbspand dismissed the idea of presenting the public with the option to crash out of the EU without a deal.“We can’t have no deal on the ballot paper,” Mr McDonnell said.Created with Sketch.

Britain would apply EU rules and standards and follow a common external tariff rate.Northern Ireland will remain in a much deeper customs arrangement from the rest of Great Britain and will also be signed up to a number of EU single market rules and regulations on goods.This has sparked outrage among many Brexiteers, who say the deal allows the EU to still dominate the UK.

Despite millions being spent on the search to located the wreckage, the Brit sleuth believes he has found the jet in a mountainous area of the Cambodian jungle.In response, the Chinese government used observation company Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area on the outskirts of Phnom Penh.However, the firm claim there was no sign of any plane, least of all the Malaysian Airlines aircraft which has been missing since March .A group of aviation experts assembled for the Australian TV programme  Minutes, broadcast in May .They claimed they may have solved the aviation mystery.They all agreed that Shah deliberately ditched the plane in the Indian Ocean west of Australia.Former Australia Transport Safety Bureau head Martin Dolan added: This was planned, this was deliberate, and it was done over an extended period of time.Simon Hardy, a pilot and instructor, discovered the captain made an unexplained and strange turn to fly over his hometown of Penang.He also claimed Shah dodged Malaysian and Thai military radar by skirting along their borders.But aviation expert has rubbished claims made in the documentary that the pilot of doomed flight MH gently landed the plane in the Indian ocean.Christine Negroni said analysis of pics of washed up wreckage shows the Boeing s wing flaps were retracted when it smashed into the sea in March  — meaning the plane was out of control when it hit the water.A British video producer has claimed to have found the missing plane on Google Maps.On September , , tech sleuth Ian Wilson claimed to have spotted the doomed jet lying in a high altitude area of the Cambodian jungle.While images from Google Maps do show the outline of a large plane – this could simply be an aircraft flying directly below the satellite which photographed it.But Ian is convinced of his findings and says he intends to visit the site to solve one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history.China used Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area but the firm claimed there was no sign of any plane.More recently, experts debunked a conspiracy theory that suggested the plane could not have sunk in the ocean as victims phones were still ringing.Many relatives were able to hear a ringing tone for up to four days after the crash.But wireless analysts claim that phone firms sometimes use a phantom ringing sound when the device is not active."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451030531.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"get on with brexit corbyn government","story":"Well, it has been a very interesting week.The British people — asthey needed further confirmation after what has gone on over the past few months — have been let down by the political class and the establishment elite.The Tories are torn apart by ideology.The party’s historically masterful, pragmatic ability to compromise has disappeared on the one hand and naked political ambition is very evident on the other.Labour has shown total disregard for everyone. Securing a general election is the only thing that matters to them.Jeremy Corbyn is showing scant regard for statesmanship and putting our country’s best interests a poor second to sheer tribal and selfish ambition.I will tell you one thing about Theresa May: No one can say she is putting herself through this for personal political ambition.Hers has been a tormented week of continued public duty and personal, selfless service.Stoic and steadfast, the Prime Minister has shown a resilience seen rarely in politics, probably last admired when another woman ran the country.The stance of Arlene Foster’s DUP is carelessly irresponsible in the extreme.A lot of the “backstop” stuff and the — unacceptable in my view — possibility of the EU being able to block our exit, has been caused by a bona fide effort from May to accommodate the DUP’s wishes.For me, it has been an interesting week in another way as well.I have presided over the board meetings of several of the six private companies I have the honour to chair.Dferent sizes, dferent sectors, dferent parts of the country, yet they are all saying the same things. That business is doing fine. Not what the doomsayers want to hear, but true. It is hard work but certainly not Armageddon.Companies up and down the land are demanding a diet of “boring, stable predictability”. It means they can invest more cash and employ more people. It is uncertainty that kills us.I am hearing from boardrooms that the Brexit proposal is fine, with one big caveat.On the plus side, a Single Market for manufactured goods will work.Anyone selling into the EU — yes, even China and Trump’s USA — has to abide by EU regulation.“Taking it” from Berlin, er, Brussels in this area is not a problem whatever ideologues may say. It secures hundreds of thousands of jobs and tax revenues.The proposed deal means business will be free to recruit essential immigrant labour on the basis of their skill and not where they come from.Choosing from a global, not just an EU, pool of talent is so, so helpful and will assist our international competitiveness hugely.But the one message ringing through my ears is, “Get on with it.”Regardless of whether a business is in Birmingham or Barcelona, Sunderland or Stuttgart, the wealth-creators of Europe, the payers of the tax that builds schools and hospitals, the job-providers just want their politicians to stop this rowing now.Stop the bullying, Berlin stop the rowing, Tories stop the naked, tribal, selfish manoeuvring, Labour — and just do it.One big caveat: You cannot expect anyone in our country — businesswoman or a guy on the line alike — to accept a deal that gives Jean-Claude Juncker’s lot the final say on when, indeed,we leave. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team have bullied us enough.While there are a million dferent beliefs on what the majority of Brits voted for in the referendum, one thing is certain: They DID vote to leave.Giving the EU the final yes no on that is unacceptable and surely no deal is better than that.No deal means no £billion to the unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats. No deal means fewer jobs in troubled Germany and faltering France.Yes, it would be harder for UK business for sure. But not fatal. There would be a price to pay, but whoever said freedom does not come at a price There was one other thing businesses were clear on at my meetings last week.The quicker this country understands there is a greater threat to prosperity, jobs, tax revenues and a successful economy than Brexit, the better.A Corbyn government would turn this country into Venezuela in short order talent and capital would leave so quickly that John McDonnell would have nothing left punitively to tax.The message from small business is as clear as it is strong.The Conservatives, Liberals, big business and the establishment must stop obsessing about Brexit and focus on the greatest threat this country has faced for decades.And that is a bunch of extreme hard-Left business-haters who would ruin this great country and probably blame their abject failure on Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The British people will rightly expect a goodon that money.Yet, when it comes to taking back democratic control over our laws, the final terms are worse than membership of the EU.We would still be bound indefinitely by EU-imposed rules on customs, trade, employment, social policy and tax – with no say over those rules, and no ability to exit the regime.The government rightly resisted pressure to accept Free Movement of people from EU countries, to allow us to regain control over our immigration policy.But, the current deal leaves it open for the EU to refuse a permanent trade deal unless we cave in during the second phase of negotiations, after March.As for the dream of a global Britain trading more energetically from Asia to Latin America, the EU has tied our hands, hobbling those ambitions.Much has been made of the Northern Ireland Protocol. No-one wants to see ato the hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Instead, the EU’s real game is to try to prise Northern Ireland away from Great Britain, aligning its laws with the EU – a direct threat to the integrity of the UK.Scenting weakness, the EU is now threatening to exclude Gibraltar from a future trade deal.We are being blackmailed and bullied into a flawed deal. The EU has used the negotiations to stle the opportunities and optimism that fired people up to vote Leave in .In truth, there are risks in any course of action we take now. But, by far the gravest is to succumb to the EU’s terms, stay tethered to Brussels, and accept a deal that prevents us from becoming masters of our own destiny.Over the long term, that would drain the strength of our economy, when Brexit should be a boost for workers and consumers. And those who voted Leave would feel cheated, shredding trust in our democracy.Of course, the EU were never going to welcome Brexit. Some sour grapes were inevitable. That’s why we worked hard to leave on positive terms, extending the arm of friendship.In , the EU has taken every concession and gesture of goodwill as a chance to try to bully and control us – at times treating our Prime Minister, and our country, with outright disdain.We need to be honest about the situation: there are risks in a No Deal scenario.But, they can be mitigated and managed by the government -it exercises grip and demonstrates political will. So, let us steel ourselves, and reject this miserly deal.We should make our best final offer to Brussels, then ready ourselves to leave the EU on  March - whatever their response.That way, we can deliver on the verdict of the people, and grasp the opportunities of Brexit.

I only want to be with her. I can never wait to see her.”Cue the nation emitting a collective swoon and ’Arry becoming odds-on favourite to take the jungle crown.“Aw, he’s sooooo lovely,” gushed one twentysomething TV commentator, asHarry had just bequeathed all his worldly possessions to help save an endangered species.Given the borderline hysterical response to this “man still loves we after  years” declaration, he might even be considered one himself.But is it really so unusual  To those dating in this Tinder-centric age where people start swiping right the second there’s a minor hiccup, perhaps. But to my generation, less so.Shortly after my Uncle Jack died in his early eighties, my Aunty Mabel announced that she wouldn’t be around for much longer because she couldn’t bear to be without him. Sure enough, she literally lost the will to live and died soon after.It was the same story with my godparents and, as a trainee reporter, I interviewed countless golden wedding coupleswho had endured all manner of marital bumps in the road but lasted the course.How many of today’s liaisons will reach that -year milestone When Harry and Sandra took their vows, they clearly both understood the now largely outdated concept that love is a decision, not just a feeling.In other words, there might have been plenty of niggles and quarrels along the waybut they pushed on through in the knowledge that reaching old age with your spouse and best friend by your side is one of le’s greatest pleasures.The shared experiences, the joy of shared memories, the private jokes, the non-awkward silences and the companionship — bliss.Interestingly, Harry and Sandra’s marital set-up is one that’s increasingly regarded as outdated in this supposedly “progressive” day and age — that of the man bringing home the bacon while the woman runs the house and does the lion’s share of parenting.Consequently, Harry, now , freely admits he can barely make a cup of tea because Sandra does everything for him.It wouldn’t be my, er, cup of tea, but it has worked for them and perhaps it’s because Harry clearly doesn’t view Sandra as “just a housewe”he sees her as the boss and someone whose input he values and respects.And therein lies the key to a happy marriage. It doesn’t matter what the dynamic is as long as each feels appreciated and respected in their chosen role.Harry is what many might consider to be an old-fashioned gentleman, when men were allowed to be one without fear of being branded patronising.He turned away from the female contestants while they were showering and, whenever he gets the chance, awards “the ladies” the rare camp comforts on offer instead of the men.A magnanimous gesture, I notice, that they all accept readily without a passing thought that it might be unfair to the male contestants in these times of supposed equality for both genders.Ashley Roberts danced her bobby socks off in the Lindy hop on Saturday’s Strictly and performed a crackingly good samba too.But she ended up in the bottom two.Why  Because the public never like what they think might be a foregone conclusion.And however much the show tries to dress her up as a plucky amateur, her previous dance experience makes it as implausible as putting Bear Grylls in the I’m A Celebrity “jungle” and seeing him scream at the sight of a cockroach.Remember that moment in Crocodile Dundee when a yob pulls a blade on Mick Dundee in New York and he responds by saying “That’s not a kne”– “that’s a kne”.Fast forward  years and consider the story of Alun Powell, of Newport, Gwent, who takes part in medieval role-playing contests as “Sir Fightalot”.A court heard that when he arrived home to find his father being plagued by a gang outside the house, he pulled a sword, axe and knuckleduster from the boot of his car and “took up a fighting stance”.The prosecution added: “They saw the weapons and got so frightened that they left as quickly as possible.”Job done. End of. Right Nope. Alun ended up in court, convicted of possessing bladed articles in public and given  hours of community service.Perhaps this is why more members of the public don’t get involved when they see trouble.Becausethey don’t have a weapon themselves, they could get hurt.Andthey do happen to have one in their house or car, and brandish it in self-defence, there’s every chance they’ll end up in court themselves while the troublemakers get away scot-free.Robert de Niro is the new face of Warburtons bread.It’s hard to choose my favourite movies starring this acting titan, but Midnight Bun would be top, followed by The Kingsmill Of Comedy and Jackie Brown Bread.Posh store Anthropologie has been ridiculed for selling a bunch of twigs for £.But is the laugh on them or the idiots who buy them In the words of the marvellous Harry Enfield, it must include “we saw you coming” tax.Following on from the debate on whether or not they should have built a ramp to rescue stranded penguins, the crew of BBC’s wildle series Dynasties are in the news again for helping a stricken lion cub.As a rule, those who film such programmes are discouraged from intervening in the events they are trying to capture on the basis that nature should be allowed to take its course.But the cub was shown collapsing and spasming after eating bait laced with poison by tribesmen who had lost their cattle to a lion a few days earlier.So perhaps the new “rule” could be that human intervention is allowed when it’s human intervention that caused the crisis in the first place So how come a -year-old Iranian man – pretending to be  – was blithely placed in a class full of GCSE pupils in Ipswich without so much as a routine dental check Education Secretary Damian Hinds has added to the curriculum certain feats he wants primary school children to achieve before they move up to secondary.He says pupils will be urged to climb trees, explore caves and watch the sun rise to help build character.A good idea, but how depressing that all the things most of us did as a matter of routine in our youth now have to be actively prescribed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it is Meghan Markle who has found herself named as the instigator of what royal insiders claim is an “extraordinarily tense” time.At first glance, the decision of Prince Harry and his we to move to a new home on the Queen’s Windsor Park estate seemed natural for a newlywed couple awaiting the birth of their first child.But by shunning moving into a Kensington Palace apartment next door to Prince William, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have revealed serious cracks in the group dynamic.It was suggested that Harry was annoyed that his brother had not “rolled out the red carpet” for Meghan and made her feel more welcome in The Firm. Only when their father Prince Charles stepped in was the spat resolved. Well, that spat anyway.“They have had quite a few arguments,” one royal source claims. “This is about Harry pulling away from his brother.”As a result, Harry and Meghan will take up residence  miles away in Frogmore Cottage. Royal observers had expected them to move into Apartment  Kensington Palace — where renovations on the roof had taken place.After years of enjoying a particularly close relationship with his younger brother, the move to Windsor comes as a huge snub to the future king and his family. Yet, while there are dficulties between the two princes, many see the real reason for the group fall-out as the clash of Kate and Meghan’s very dferent personalities.The American actress and the reserved middle-class girl from the Home Counties are poles apart, with very little in common. It is this lack of familiarity that is slowly breeding contempt.As one source reveals: “They try their best to get along but they are two people from wildly dferent places, so it is perhaps inevitable that they will rub each other up the wrong way.”Kate toes the royal line, almost to a fault. She dresses demurely and hardly utters a word, apparently desperate never to put a foot wrong. Many people admire her for it. But critics have labelled her boring and say she performs the minimum of royal duties, never straying too far from home.Then along came Meghan. Forceful, opinionated and go-getting — as one would expect from a woman making her way in the tough world of LA showbiz. Even before her position in the family was formalised, she was already undertaking public engagements, thirsty to meet the public and show just what an asset she could be to the House of Windsor.Nothing would be too much trouble for her — no distance too far, no heel too high. But Meghan could not walk into the royal fold and accept its rules without a murmur. It was clear from the start she wanted to do things her way, and Harry was happy to let his we do the talking.This summer, as the headlines hovered over Harry and Meghan — their barnstorming tour of Australia and New Zealand, for instance — William and Kate looked dull by comparison. But now  Yesterday The Sun told of an uncomfortable scene between the two sisters-in-law before Meghan’s wedding, at a bridesmaid dress fitting for Princess Charlotte.Royal sources said the “stressful” fitting became too much for Kate, who was left shaken and in tears. That followed revelations of a row after Meghan had been invited to choose a tiara from the royal collection for her wedding day.Meghan, who has an eye for attention-grabbing moments — this week being shown in previously unseen photos trying on a striking headdresses while exploring her family ancestry in Malta in  — selected one featuring emeralds. But was then told she would have to choose another.Prince Harry backed her original choice, even raising his voice to staff, saying: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.” Eventually, the Queen had to step in and bring her grandson into line.While these dficulties could simply be seen as the Bridezilla moments of an anxious woman ahead of the biggest day of her le, some of those who have been around her say Meghan can be dficult and demanding. She is said to “snap” and to think nothing of bombarding staff with emails and calls as early as am.Staff reportedly gossip about her and Harry, with some speculating the union could be over within five years. Meghan’s former PA Melissa Touabti — who previously worked for pop star Robbie Williams — quit just six months after the wedding and has refused to say why.Harry’s long-standing private secretary Ed Lane Fox also left his job earlier this year. And deputy communications secretary Katrina McKeever quietly departed in September. But the move to Frogmore could give the Fab Four the space they so desperately need.Where the respective couples choose to hang their festive stockings could signal how serious this rt really is.DEAR DEIDRE: I JUST don’t know why Kate doesn’t like me. Yes, I’ve been hogging the limelight a little lately – but I can’t help being a stunningly beautul Hollywood actress with a baby on the way.Just ask any of my celebrity friends, I’m a really great person. Serena Williams will tell you how brilliant I am and the Clooneys just adore me. Maybe it’s that my hair is glossier than hers  Or perhaps she’s jealous that my family make Uncle Gary look tame I’ve got to say that I didn’t feel a very warm welcome from William and Kate when I first moved into Kensington Palace. I find that odd because I just love entertaining – have I mentioned that I’m also an amazing cook How can we become more sisterly Meghan, Duchess of SussexWe Brits, especially the posh ones, shudder at name-dropping. Kate actually comes from a middle-class family herself, so had to learn the Firm’s code of what is acceptable as an incomer.Interestingly, you’ve also fought your way up the social ladder in the States, and the American way is assertively to display your strengths and achievements. But now you’re a royal, stop mentioning how well connected you are.Why not ask Kate to give you some tips on how to go down well in British society. She’ll love you for it. You’re more similar than dissimilar.DEAR DEIDRE: ONE doesn’t usually like to cry, but I’ve been finding the tension between myself and my new sister-in-law untenable.And no, it’s not just because her wardrobe is trendier than mine. Did you see that thigh-slit dress in Australia  One hasn’t flashed such flesh since THAT see-through dress at St Andrew’s.She seems to be Princess Perfect, shining in front of the camera and getting up every morning at am. I don’t even do that with three young kids.I’ve tried watching Suits to have something to chat about over high tea, but she always moves the conversation on to her celebrity friends.We’re fundamentally dferent people, but I do want to bond with her for the sake of my husband. What can I do to help build up a rapport Catherine, Duchess of CambridgeBut don’t let her confidence fool you. You are the one who is going to be Queen, you are the one who is settled right inside the bosom of the Royal Family and loved by all.If Meghan has seemed to try to throw her weight around, some of it is down to US “assertiveness”, some of it to sheer nerves.It’s great Meghan and Harry are making room for her mum to come over for y stays after the baby.It would be a great ice-breaker and good family-bonding moveyou got her together with your mum.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He is the Health Secretary, for God’s sake. Why doesn’t he get the medicines, instead of issuing stupid threats At least Michael Gove’s pitul descent into Project Fear ignominy, with his own Hancockian warning about running out of drinking water, turns out to be fake news — or so I’m told.And where has all this left us With a Brexit “deal” that is not really a deal and doesn’t actually deliver Brexit. The transition period leaves Britain subject to most EU rules, and there is no agreement on what comes next — just an agenda for more negotiations.How dare Mrs May say last Sunday, “The British people don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit. They want a good deal that fulfils the vote” Her plan guarantees years more “arguing about Brexit” and obviously doesn’t fulfil the vote. I know politicians spin everything but this is in a dferent league. It’s not spin, Prime Minister — what you are saying is a bare-faced lie, and you know it.It is also disgraceful that the civil service is helping push out this lying propaganda at taxpayers’ expense with its Cabinet Office “Project Vote” operation.But we shouldn’t be surprised. The senior civil service has catastrophically mishandled Brexit all along, finally exposing as self-serving fiction the idea that it is the professional, reliableof the national interest, there to save the nation from the half-baked schemes of here today, gone tomorrow politicians.Yes indeed: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”But now what, you might say. It’s easy to criticise — what would you do Well, I’ve said it before : Pursuing a “deal” with the EU is a waste of time. Of course you can’t stay in the single market but regain control of immigration. Of course you can’t stop paying membership fees but still set the rules. And as President Trump noted, of course you can’t strike new trade deals unless you fully leave.There is no such thing as a “soft Brexit”. There is Brexit, without adjectives — or staying in the EU in some form. “Fulfilling the vote” now requires two things: Preparing for a clean break and counteracting the inevitable short-term disruption.Disgracefully, and cynically, the Government refused to prepare for a clean break over the past two years, so now we are behind. But that doesn’t mean we can’t do it — it just means an all-out effort must be made, andnecessary the exit date pushed back.However solid the preparations, though, there is bound to be economic turbulence. But here too, we can be proactive. The Government could almost instantly make Britain the world’s top destination for business and investment.Slash corporation tax and regulations. Roll out the red carpet for entrepreneurs, scientists, investors. Commit to building the world’s most modern infrastructure and best-trained workforce.Business hates uncertainty more than anything. That is why Theresa May’s deal is a disaster — it prolongs uncertainty.A clean break and a radical pro-enterprise agenda would end uncertainty and counteract the short-term shock of departure.Once we have left, and shown how dynamic post-Brexit Britain can be, we will have much more leverage to negotiate a trade deal with the EU.Objectors will say: This is fantasy — there is no majority in Parliament for a clean break. But there is no majority for anything  either, and in any case, with a clean-break scenario the EU Withdrawal Act does not require a vote that binds the Government.But perhaps the biggest question is: Who can make this happen My idea of bringing back Cameron went down like a lead balloon. After the Rees-Mogg rebellion flopped, we are stuck with Mrs May — evenshe loses on December . No one can see a way out.There is only one answer. Pro-Brexit MPs, inside and outside Cabinet, must develop a spine, step up and unite to offer a positive alternative.

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard. Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ministers have agreed to let MPs attempt to make changes to the motion before it’s passed. They will allow up to six amendments to its main Brexit motion to be voted on first, before the PM’s deal. Labour has already tabled an amendment to the meaningful vote designed to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal. The government hopes putting the amendments first will expose a lack of a Commons majority for anything other than Theresa Mays deal.  Labours amendment would prevent Britain crashing out without a deal.Jeremy Corbyn said: “Labour will oppose Theresa May’s botched Brexit deal that puts jobs, rights and people’s livelihoods at risk.“There is a sensible deal that could win the support of Parliament, based on a comprehensive customs union, with a British say in future trade deals, and a strong single market deal that protects rights at work and environmental safeguards and helps us to rebuild our economy and expand our public services. However, Theresa May’s worst of all worlds deal is miles away from delivering that.“It is a miserable failure of negotiation by a Government that has wasted the last two years fighting with itself, rather than securing a better deal with the EU.“The Tories have no right to inflict the chaos that would following crashing out of the European Union without a deal. That is why we will work with all sides in Parliament to oppose no deal. A backbench move to call for the UK to join the European Free Trade Areais also expected. But without Labour support it is doomed to fail. The motion also confirms there will be five days of debate on , , ,  and  December with eight hours protected time on each day. MPs will then vote on  December.  If the Prime Ministers deal is voted down - as is widely expected- there is disagreement over what would happen next. Some suggest she could go back to the EU and renegotiate. But Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said at the weekend this was the only deal on offer. Labour have suggested they will call a vote of no confidence in Mrs May. If she loses Jeremy Corbyn will then have  days to try and form a government -not there will be a general election.

In his letter the Leader of the Opposition warns that this Christmas over , children will be languishing in temporary accommodation without a home to call their own and more people than ever will be reliant on food banks, including nearly , children. Charities and campaigners have warned that foodbanks face their worst Christmas ever as the rollout of Universal Credit continues. The Labour leader told Theresa May: The scale of poverty in Britain shames this Tory Government. This is a national emergency which must no longer be ignored.  Referring to the report by the UN Special Rapporteur, Mr Corbyn said the Government “shames our nation by being condemned for its neglect of its poorest citizens”, UN expert, Philip Alston, found punitive, mean-spirited and often callous welfare cuts had inflicted great misery on the British people. But the report was dismissed by newly-appointed Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd who described it as a very political report. She insisted that Universal Credit was a force for good. Mr Corbyn said that the next Labour government “will be judged by how we reduce poverty, inequality and homelessness – as any government should be”. Full text ofletter: Dear Prime Minister, While Brexit is understandably dominating the political agenda, I am writing to express my disappointment at the Government’s response to the report into poverty in the UK by the UN Special Rapporteur, Professor Philip Alston. Professor Alston deserves our immense thanks for his work and for highlighting the shocking reality of modern Britain – the fth largest economy in the world. However, despite receiving the report more than one week ago, the only formal response from the Government has been supplied by the Work and Pensions Secretary, who expressed disappointment at the language used in the report. Is the Government’s position that it is more disappointed by the language used to describe the poverty in Britain than the alarming facts of poverty in Britain  It is no surprise that the rapporteur concluded that, “there is a striking and almost complete disconnect between what I heard from the Government and what I consistently heard from many people directly, across the country”. His conclusion comes just two years after another UN rapporteur found the Governments welfare reforms and austerity policies had led to “grave and systematic violations” of disabled peoples rights. Child poverty has increased by half a million since . We now have over . million children living in poverty. Professor Alston concluded that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”. It is imperative that the Government ends the two-child policy in Universal Credit . In government, Labour would also investonce again in the Sure Start programme and in providing free school meals to all primary school children. Rough sleeping has more than doubled and the scale of rough sleepers dying on our streets shames any nation that claims to be civilised. This Christmas, over , children will be languishing in temporary accommodation, without a home to call their own. We have set out how this crisis can be tackled: we will make , homes available for those with a history of rough sleeping, we will build council housing on a scale not seen for more than three decades, and we will regulate the private rented sector to control rents – which have risen more than pound a year compared to . With over one-fth of the populationliving in poverty and . million destitute, this crisis cannot be ignored and neither can the Government delay taking action. Yesterday, a report by the Trussell Trust found that more people than ever will be reliant on food banks this Christmas, including nearly , children. Poverty has a debilitating effect on people’s le chances – it is shameful that le expectancy has stagnated and is now actually falling in some of Britain’s poorest communities. Most children living in poverty live in a working household. In-work poverty is at record levels due to low pay and insecure contracts. Labour believes we must tackle the scourge of low pay by increasing the minimum wage to the level of the real living wageand eliminating discriminatory youth rates. The only way to secure and sustain decent pay levels is through strong trade union and employment rights, which is why we would repeal the Trade Union Act and ban zero-hour contracts. The UN report should be a wake-up call about the rising levels of poverty and destitution that exist in Britain today – this is a national emergency. Austerity was a political choice and the UN Special Rapporteur has laid out the consequences of your Government’s policies. These policies have hit disabled people, women and BAME communities particularly hard. Many councils – the democratic local institutions there to support their communities – have seen their budgets slashed by % on average since . These cuts have seen libraries, youth centres, and Sure Start centres close in their hundreds. Social services have been slashed and our dedicated public servants, from social workers to youth workers and police, are having to tackle more acute social problems with fewer resources. The Labour Party stands committed to tackling injustice and to reversing the shocking trends of rising poverty, rising homelessness and rising destitution. If the Government brings forward any or all of the following measures in legislation, we will expedite these through the House of Commons:Ending the benefit freeze Scrapping the bedroom tax Stopping the roll-out of Universal Credit Ending the five-week wait for a first benefit payment Ending the two child cap and scrapping the rape clauseEnding the punitive sanctions regime We cannot stand by while our nation – the fth richest in the world – is condemned by the United Nations for failing the most vulnerable in our society. The Government is failing to tackle the burning injustices faced by the poorest people in our country, but you can change that – and we are willing to help.I would also be gratefulyou could give the commitment of a date by which the Government will be responding in full to the recommendations in the report. Given the public interest in this issue, I will be making thisletterpublic. While this Government shames our nation by being condemned for its neglect of its poorest citizens, the next Labour government will be judged by how we reduce poverty, inequality and homelessness – as any government should be.Yours sincerely, Rt HonJeremyCorbynMPLeader of the Opposition"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit leaved both","story":"NewsNo-deal Brexit leaves both the EU and UK at greater risk Security Minister warnsBen Wallace will warn that departing the bloc without an agreement would have a \"real impact\" on authorities ability to protect the publicShareByHayden Smith:,  NOV NewsHe will say a no-deal would have a real impact on our ability to work with our European partners to protect the public \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA no-deal Brexit would leave both the EU and UK at greater risk, the Security Minister will say.

UK agencies would no longer be plugged in to systems for exchanging data including criminal records, alerts on wanted suspects, DNA, fingerprints and airline passenger information. Extradition requests would take longer, while cooperation on counter-terrorism, cyber security and illegal migration would be affected. In his speech, Mr Wallace will outline how the Brexit agreement sets the foundations for the most comprehensive security relationship the EU has ever had with another country. The Government says the future partnership will include the ability to exchange information on criminals and tackle terrorism, to quickly share data on people travelling to and from the UK to spot potential threats, to exchange DNA and fingerprints, and to fast-track extraditions. This deal strikes the right balance to keep everyone safe, Mr Wallace will say.  It will be an ambitious partnership that ensures we can continue to work with our European partners in tackling our shared threats.Diane Abbott MP, Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary, dismissed the Brexit security deal as dangerously flimsy.“There is no new security treaty on offer, which is vital for cross-border policing arrangements especially extradition, she said. Our access to policing and justice databases are also likely to be compromised without a new security treaty. There is too only the vaguest reference to many of the other vital tools that police here and in Europe use to tackle international terrorism and organised crime. “The Government offers only aspirations for a vague security partnership, no plans for proper security arrangements, including with Europol. “It is simply unacceptable. This is a bad deal for the country and fails on guarantees for security. Anyone who cares about our ability to tackle international crime should vote against Theresa May’s deal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"north bearing brunt universal credit","story":"NewsThe North is bearing the brunt of Universal Credit says LabourIt has led to double the number of benefits sanctions than in the south, says Labour.ShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  NOV NewsDouble the number of benefits sanctions have been handed out in the North \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe north is bearing the brunt of Universal Credit according to Labour.The party said the governments decision to rollout the scheme to northern constituencies first has meant that double the number of benefits sanctions have been doled out in the north than in the south. Labour MP Stephanie Peacock said: “The north is bearing the brunt of a policy that the Tories have delayed imposing on their own constituencies.” Statistics compiled for Labour show the North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber had .% of all sanctions applied, with , northerners being hit. The House of Commons Library figures show more than double the proportion were hit than in the south. The government insist that overall the number of sanctions is falling.  They say the statistics fail to take into account the gradual roll-out of Universal Credit to dferent regions since  and argue that there is more up-to-date data available. Ms Peacock told the Mirror: “It is totally clear that the UC roll out has been nothing short of a disaster so far, and people in northern towns like Barnsley have paid the human price.  “People who left are waiting weeks without payment and many of those sanctioned are found to have lost out unfairly. I’ve seen too many people driven to food banks, into debt or even on to the streets, as they struggle to pay the bills without the support they need. “It is long past time to halt the roll out entirely, and Ministers need to get the message. The Prime Minister promised to govern for the whole country but the stark truth that her government punished, not protected, the people I represent.” MPs on the work and pensions committee have called for a review of the “pointlessly cruel” sanctions system which they say does not help claimants into work. Last year the Mirror revealed the Tories had delayed the rollout of the hated scheme to the constituencies of some of their party’s key figures including the Prime Minister and Chancellor.Analysis of government figures this week showed that more than half of appeals against sanctions were successful, but claimants were left out of pocket during the appeal process. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. Meanwhile foodbanks are gearing up for their busiest Christmas ever because of the rollout of the combined benefit. The Mirror is campaigning for a halt to the expansion of UC and for a review of the discredited system. The Department for Work and Pensions said the North West “obviously” has more UC claimants. “Sanctions are rare and the proportion… sanctioned has halved in the last year.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tories promised save free tv","story":"NewsTories promised to save free TV licences for pensioners knowing it they couldntA law passed the month before the manesto was written hands the power to strip over-s of their free licences to the BBC in ShareByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  NOV News \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Tories made a promise to save free TV licences for pensioners which was impossible for the government to deliver, a minister has admitted. The Government-funded scheme, which provides free TV licences to older viewers, comes to an end in June . The BBC has launched a consultation exercise on its future but warned that continuing with the scheme could cost around a fth of the budget.

Lord Ashton, a Tory minister in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport admitted the government had no power to protect free TV licences when the promise was made. Challenged on the doomed pledge in Parliament on Tuesday, he said: “We absolutely made it clear to the BBC that we expect them to continue with this important concession.” He said the Digital Economy Act made clear the Government “retains the power to maintain the concession to , which we are going to do, after which full responsibility will transfer to the BBC – so it took place before the manesto was written”. Labour Peer Toby Harris said: “The government has finally come clean about its willingness to subcontract tax raising powers to the BBC.  “But it also shows that the commitment made on license fees in the last Tory manesto wasn’t worth the paper it was written on.” Tom Watson said: “This is the Tories admitting that they are ripping up their manesto promise. In fact the logic of what the Minister has said today is that Theresa May knowingly misled pensioners when she signed off a manesto promise that she was not going to be able to deliver. “Millions of older people will feel totally betrayed and very concerned about the prospect of losing their free TV licences. “If the claim that austerity is over had any credibility the Government would step in and provide the money to ensure older people don’t lose their TV licences.” "},{"url":null,"title":"american loses eye after being","story":"NewsAmerican loses eye after being glassed on birthday night out in BirminghamWARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Jonathan Hockaday, , says his eye was mangled after the vicious attack, and he has been scarred for leShareCommentsByAlyce Collins:,  NOV NewsJonathan in hospital after the attack in April \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA -year-old man has lost an eye after being attacked with a pint glass in a Birmingham nightclub. American Jonathan Hockaday was celebrating his birthday with his family when the glass was smashed into the left side of his face, leaving his eye mangled. He endured months of hospital treatment and several operations, and medics were unable to save his eye. His attacker, who is now serving  years behind bars for grievous bodily harm, mocked him for being American before pinning him against a wall and assaulting him. Jonathans left eyeball was completely mutilated and he was left with permanent scarring and nerve damage.  Although the prosthetic eye has not restored his vision, the victim said it has improved his confidence because it helps him to appear normal to strangers. Jonathan, from Ohio, said he was with his brother and cousin when he was attacked on April . He said: He attacked me and then he turned to also attack my brother. I interfered to protect my brother and so the assailant came at me with a pint glass.  He pinned me against the wall and smashed the pint glass on the left side of my face. After I sustained the major injuries to my face, other people helped to stop the bleeding and they called the emergency services. He continued: My condition was very bad - my eyeball was mangled from the impact of the glass and I completely lost all vision on my left side.  So, I had to relearn a lot of daily tasks due to the change in depth perception. I also had lacerations on the back of my head, shoulder blade and cheek. Even today I have scarring across the left side of my face. The intense nerve damage has left me numb from my eyebrow up onto my scalp and towards the back of my head. Jonathan eventually flew back to America on May , more than two weeks after the attack.  Jonathan and his family started a GoFundMe page shortly after the attack occurred to help pay for the mounting medical bills, travel expenses and the prosthetic eye he would later be fitted with. My parents and I had to extend our stay due to check ups and for medical reasons, so we stayed until May , said Jonathan. The doctor wanted to monitor my healing for  days after the surgeries and remove the stitching after two weeks.  It took about three months for the swelling to go down enough so that I could be fitted for a prosthetic eye. To have that in made me feel better because I felt like I appeared normal to strangers. The prosthetic eye cant be taken out too often, but I aim to remove it every two months and I have to have it polished once a year. Then it will need completely replacing every five years.  Putting it simply, I dont have an eye now. Ive lost something that I was born with and it has been challenging to adjust in so many ways. Ive had to approach everyday tasks with a new perspective and change how I do them to accommodate for the loss I suffered. My balance is off now because of the imbalance of my vision, so walking around is a conscious effort. I also struggle to pick up and put down items and to catch now because of a lack of depth perception. Despite what I went through, of course I would stillto the UK because I love the country and the people there.

Dennis Banfield, , and we Shirley, , have been married for  years and lived in the same house for most of them. They scooped an poundmillion jackpot in February, but rather than move into a plush new pad, the couple have opted to renovate their family home. They brought up their two daughters there after buying the property in  – when the average house in Winterbourne, Glos, cost just pound,.  But the couple didn’t head to a luxury resort while the builders were in – opting instead for a nearby budget hotel, with rooms costing pound per night. Speaking outside the hotel yesterday, the couple said they are looking forward to moving back into their home before Christmas. Shirley said: “We decided to stay in the house and just have the whole of the inside of it completely redone. “We’ve been there for  years now. We know the area, the house is not overlooked, it’s got a lovely big driveway. “We’ve gone back to see it as it’s been done up. “There’s still a bit of a way to go on it, but we’re hoping to move back in within the next fortnight – we’ll definitely be back in in time for Christmas.” The three-bed property has a current estimated market value of pound,. The front garden is still full of fittings that have been torn out for the renovations and a large skip in the front garden is full of plasterboard – with a decorator’s van and a skip parked outside.  But the generous couple, who have given away a lot of their winnings to charity, revealed they are simply looking forward to moving back and spending a quiet Christmas at home with family. That includes their daughters – with whom they split their lottery winnings. The elderly couple also revealed they had told Tina, , and Karen, , that they always played for them, to secure their future. The Banfields split the money three ways, Tina and Karen getting just over poundmillion each, with Dennis and Shirley keeping the remaining third for themselves. Shirley said: “They have both bought new houses with their share of the money. It means a lot to us to know they are looked after.” As to their own share, Shirley explained: “We’ve given a lot of it away in lump sums. “We’ve been able to give to the cancer units, to the children’s hospital, as well as helping out our community in Winterbourne – and giving to the chapel and the community association. “I wouldn’t say the money has changed us – it’s only prompted us to better other people. “We can’t exactly go jetting off on a round-the-world adventure at our age.”  Dennis, who will be  on December , added: “It doesn’t mean anything to us, really.”However, when the couple won the pound,, jackpot in February, Dennis had to wipe away tears of joy as his family revealed it was he who had bought the ticket form his local shop. Dennis, who worked for  years at South Western Electricity Board, said at the time: “All that has ever mattered to Shirley and I is that the girls are OK. To know they are, is a wonderful feeling.” He added: “While I didn’t think I would be interested in a new car, it is rather tempting. “Although, with my dodgy knee, I might need to get a chauffeur to go with the car.” Meanwhile, the search for the winner of a poundmillion lotto prize is intensying, with just days to go till the pm Sunday deadline. The winning ticket was bought in the Boston and Skegness region of Lincolnshire for the November  draw.

Karl Martin bought the jar at a car boot sale five years ago for just pound, unaware of its true value. But when the -year-old antiques valuer noticed a similar piece of pottery being sold in an antiques sale at the auctioneers where he worked around six weeks ago, he decided to get it checked out. He asked a colleague at Hansons Auctioneers to examine his pot - and was amazed to be told it was a genuine antiquity from Afghanistan and dated back to  BC. Dad-of-one Karl, of Derby, said: “I used it in the bathroom to store my toothpaste and toothbrush – it even ended up getting a few toothpaste marks on it.   It was bought from a car boot sale in the village of Willington in Derbyshire. I liked it straight away. I suspected it might be very old but forgot all about it. “Then, one day at work, I was helping Hansons’ antiquities expert James Brenchley unload a van and noticed some pottery which was similar to my toothbrush pot. “The painting style looked the same and it had similar crudely-painted animal figures. “I rescued the pot from my bathroom and asked him to examine it for me.   “He confirmed it was a genuine antiquity from Afghanistan and dated back to  BC. “That means it’s around , years old – made , years before Christ was born.

I feel a bit guilty about keeping my toothbrush in it now.” James Brenchley, head of antiquities at Hansons Auctioneers, said: “This is an Indus Valley Harappan Civilisation pottery jar dating back to  BC.   “This was a Bronze Age civilisation mainly in the north western regions of South Asia. “Along with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early cradles of civilisations of the Old World, and of the three, the most widespread. “The civilisation was primarily located in modern-day India and Pakistan as well as Afghanistan. “I do come across items like this from time to time and was familiar with the painting technique. “It was probably brought back to the UK years ago by wealthy travellers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"frankie bennys bans mobile phones","story":"NewsFrankie and Bennys BANS mobile phones in drastic bid to get diners talkingFrankie  Bennys is introducing the policy at all  of its UK restaurants starting this week after shocking research about the use of mobile phonesShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  NOV NewsWhat do you think of the idea  \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFrankie and Bennys is banning customers from using their mobile phones while eating dinner.

Lochside House, a humble cottage in the Scottish Highlands, was awarded the gong this week by the Royal Institute of British Architects . Its an off-grid property, with energy provided by the sun and water pulled up from a borehole. Ben Derbyshire, Riba president, described the home as truly breathtaking and the perfect addition to this dream landscape. It sits on the edge of a tranquil lake in the west Highlands. The property, designed by Haysom Ward Miller Architects, is owned by a ceramic artist and formed of three finely-crafted buildings huddled together and clad in burnt Scottish larch, protected by a traditional drystone wall.  It was praised by Riba for being perfectly integrated into the wild and rugged landscape. Takero Shimazaki, architect and chairman of the  Riba House of the Year jury, said there was an overwhelming sense of comfort, warmth and homeliness inside the house.  It was astonishing that the owners vision was not scuppered by the remoteness and challenging weather, the judge added.

If you believe the courtiers, Meghan is every negative clicheacute you can think of - the pushy American, the dficult orceacutee, the angry black woman, the uppity pleb, the Hollywood a. She doesnt understand the Royal rules, is a common refrain from anonymous sources, who go on to criticise the fact she wears trousers, black tuxedos, and has a distressing habit of not wearing a hat when the Queen is wearing a hat.Its almost like she didnt grow up PLANNING to be a princess, isnt it  If we take a cue from Wallis Simpson as the only previous American orceacutee to marry a Royal, it wont be long before someone suggests the new bride isnt even a female. There were long-whispered claims Wallis was a he, that she engaged in sado-masochistic sexual practices, that she had used her wiles to entice Edward VIII from his duty. So it cant be long before somebody - probably another Markle, considering their back catalogue - claims that Meghan once owned a pair of furry handcuffs and has Harry under her thumb. It all feeds into the narrative of there being a right sort of woman, and a wrong sort. The same happened with Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson, with reams of coverage about their friendship, hen nights, falling-outs and, now, the eyebrow-raising living arrangements Sarah has with her ex-husband the Duke of York. But Sarah is seen as a harmless clown whos a bit of an embarrassment. Meghan is regarded more like Diana in her final years - so unprincess-like that shes a threat to the monarchy itself.   The best advice ever given to me was to judge people by what theyve done, not what is said. So lets look at Meghans achievements: . Years of hard work to achieve success in dficult industry . Financial independence . Survived a mostly-appalling family . Mostnot all of the in-laws seem to like her . Impressed someone who had his pick of the entire worlds female population . A clap less mental than Kates  On top of that shes privately visited the Grenfell Tower survivors, helped them raise more than pound, with sales of a charity cookbook, and just five months after marrying conducted herself on a two-week Royal tour of the South Pacic with grace and aplomb.

Trilok Nath Pandit spent more than two decades interacting with the Sentinelese tribe, who he said are not a hostile people. The -year-old first visited the island back in , and by  had built up enough trust that tribe members accepted food from him. But he said he heeded warnings that he was not welcome on the island, and said Mr Chau should have done the same. The Christian missionary was visiting the island, in the Bay of Bengal, hoping to convert members of the endangered tribe. Writing in The Economic Times , Mr Pandit - who has written a book about the tribe - said: They give enough warnings the outsiders must respect that and .But this gentleman took too much of a risk and possibly ignored their warnings and ventured into the island. When he first set foot on the island, he said, he and his team landed and walked into the jungle, but did not encounter the tribe - although he is certain they were watching.  They discovered a settlement of around  huts where items including bows, arrows and spears were found. But on subsequent visits in the s and s, he wrote, the Sentinelese would confront his team when they approached the island. Except our first visit, we never walked around on the island, Mr Pandit stated. We understood their warnings. He visited again in , when tribe members took coconuts from the groups hands, but still did not allow them onto the island. Speaking to the BBC, he added that the Sentinelese threatened visitors, but it never escalated to the point where anyone was killed or injured.  He said: I feel very sad for the death of this young man who came all the way from America.But he made a mistake. He had enough chance to save himself. On one occasion, he said, a boy armed with a kne made a gesture suggesting he would cut off his head - at which point he made a quick retreat. Since these encounters, Indian laws have made it illegal to enter the island.  A police boat trying to reach Mr Chaus body has had a tense face-off with the Sentinelese tribesmen off the coast of their remote atoll in the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. The boat withdrew to avoid confrontation having stationed themselves m offshore - seeing the tribesmen through binoculars on the beach armed with bows and arrows. Fishermen who ferried -year-old Chau to North Sentinel on  November said they saw the tribesmen drag a body along a beach and bury it. The same fishermen later accompanied police back to the point on the island where they believed the body was buried before the stand-off. Regional police chief Dependra Pathak told AFP: They stared at us and we were looking at them. We have mapped the area with the help of these fishermen. We have not spotted the body yet but we roughly know the area where he is believed to be buried.

It’s a tight league and everybody keeps beating everybody .“We need to keep going and get three points wherever we can, others can worry about thatthey want.”Even so, the summer arrival from Dunfermline admits to draw level with a team who looked almost out of sight just under two months ago would be a boost.“We knowwe go and win against Ayr we will be level with the team who are top of the league right now, so that’s a massive incentive for us.“We were eight points behind when the manager came in andwe have wiped that out by next Friday it would be a big achievement.“It shows the dference in the team now but what is most important is we keep working hard in training every day and get the points at the weekends.”That dference he refers to meant his recall to the starting XI took him by surprise, though it was one he was ready for.“It was brilliant to be back on from the start but to be honest I wasn’t expecting it because the boys have been doing brilliant.“When you get your chance it’s important you take it and I was delighted to get  minutes and help out with a goal.“My last start was Queen of the South away in the second league game of the season, so the next one has been a long time in coming.“I picked up an injury and that set me back for a while but I’ve been working hard in training to get my fitness back up.“When you’ve been out you need to get yourself prepared for when you do come back but, obviously, the boys have been great and I did think I might have had to wait a bit longer than this.“It’s a massive squad here and a great squad as well.

He’s out of contract in the summer but it looks a safe bet a new one will be on the table for him.Edjenguele is also a free agent next year and, at , it’s dficult to say where he will be playing his football come the   campaign.However,it’s where, it looks likely he will have moved on after playing a part in any success that’s about to come United’s way.Out of the league team since the opening-day defeat against the Pars, he’s had to wait for his chance.It came when Frederic Frans got injured in the warm-up prior to the Queen of the South win. A clean sheet in that one and another, part in thanks to a huge performance at the heart of the defence from the Frenchman, up at Ross County saw him retain his place for Alloa even when Frans was back fit.It could still be that over the course of the season he reverts to squad player status.Several times since his arrival the manager has stressed the contribution of those coming in when others are out through injury and suspension will be vital. Evenit’s just on that level, Edjenguele has shown he can have a part to play."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bfd19a75e711.jpg ","title":"free travel santas wearing red suits can get buses at no cost to dundee dash","story":"It’s the festive fundraiser spectacle of the year – and what better way to travel to it than by bus This year’s Santa Dash – in which hundreds of people dressed as Father Christmas will take to the streets to raise money for the Archie Foundation – takes place on Sunday.And transport firm Xplore is lending the event its support – offering free bus travel to anyone dressed up.Christine McGlasson, managing director of Xplore Dundee, said: “This is a great event for a fantastic cause and we’re very happy to support it once again.“Anyone wearing the red suit will be able to get on board a bus to the city centre for free to join in the festive fun.”The Santa Dash will kick off at .am in City Square.Hundreds of participants will follow a km km route through the city centre.The second annual event is being sponsored by furniture and carpet store Gillies, with the Eveningand Wave FM also backing the dash.Funds will go towards the charity’s Tayside appeal, which has a target of raising £ million for a new children’s operating theatre suite at Tayside Children’s Hospital.Garry Smith, events and promotions officer for Leisure and Culture Dundee, said: “It’s going to be a busy weekend with people doing their Christmas shopping, so we recommend the Santas get the bus for free.“It’s just so much easier than travelling by car and having to find a parking space.”Ward Road and Commercial Street will be closed from am until pm and Xplore Dundee customers are encouraged to check the full ersion details online before travelling because some bus routes will be affected.The price of entering the dash £ for adults, £. for under-s, £. for under fives and free for kids under three.Bookings close today and can be made at Central Library, Olympia or Dundee Ice Arena before the centres close.To book online, visit leisureand culturedundee santadash before midnight tomorrow.Dashers can start fundraising with Virgin Money Giving at bit.ly qltwDY.

The opportunity concerns how you work with customers and clients to connect into the latest technology to create the best experiences.”Royal Bank of Scotland has long been at the forefront of innovation, from printing the first multi-coloured banknotes in  to installing some of the country’s first ATMs in the s, and it remains at the cutting edge of new financial technology.On its mission to continually develop and update products and features to make banking more convenient and secure for customers, it has invested in new apps to help business customers manage expenses digitally and to give commercial card customers complete control of their account in real time.In , Royal Bank was the first bank to launch a comprehensive internet banking service. Last year it introduced a new ground breaking safety and security feature, face ID. Other recent major steps forward include the launch of Esme Loans, a digital lending  that allows UK-based SMEs to quickly obtain unsecured loans of up to £,, and for personal customers the bank is still the only one to offer completely paperless mortgage applications.Dan Salmons, director of innovation at Royal Bank, added: “I’m tremendously positive about technology. Ultimately, we control it and it’s there to solve problems and to serve us.“Daleks can’t climb stairs, so it will be quite a long time before they take over the world.”Recognising how people live and work in the modern age and finding technology-led solutions to make the customer journey better is at the heart of Royal Bank of Scotland.That ethos has led its development team to design an articial intelligence-powered ‘digital human’ called Cora. Through Cora, Royal Bank of Scotland is the first UK bank to use articial intelligence as a chatbot. Cora converses with customers in branches and can answer more than  queries, including how to log in to online banking, how to apply for a mortgage and what to doyou lose your card, as well as providing advice on card payments and fraud prevention.The last point is particularly relevant: the survey shows  per cent of Scots fear their personal information falling into the wrong hands. It’s more of a concern for women almost two-thirdsof women listed data and personal information as a concern, compared to  per cent of men.Growing up as digital natives,  to -year-olds were the least concerned about protecting their datawhile over-s felt this most strongly . Evidence from this year’s Royal Bank Mobile Microleisure Report also revealed that young people are the least likely of all age groups to take measures such as installing security software on their mobile phones.Royal Bank is focused on designing new measures to help customers stay safe and secure in the virtual world and in real le. That’s why you’ll find a TechXpert in each of Royal Bank of Scotland’s branches, who can demonstrate and teach customers how to use every feature of mobile banking, from staying safe online to registering for digital banking.Community bankers also host training sessions in digital and mobile banking in towns and villages across the country to help customers and technology to move forward together. vw, px\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-council-could-ban-silent-discos-because-theyre-too-noisy","story":"A council could become the first in Britain to ban silent discos - after complaints they are too noisy."},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds-of-jobs-to-be-created-in-30m-ayrshire-port-redevelopment","story":"Hundreds of jobs are to be created with the multi-million redevelopment of a Scots port and marine yard into a decommissioning and renewables hub."},{"url":null,"title":"world-famous-benihana-gears-up-for-city","story":"BENIHANA bosses have given Glasgow diners a first look inside the teppanyaki restaurant as it prepares to open in the City Centre."},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds-to-join-annual-st-andrews-day-torchlight-parade","story":"GLASGOW has been urged to ring in St Andrews Day with an annual torchlight parade featuring fire dancers and pipe bands."},{"url":null,"title":"singing-sensation-gerry-cinnamon-reveals-all-about-life-in-the-spotlight","story":"MUSIC star Gerry Cinamon has spoken out about skyrocketing to fame with hit tune Belter."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-winger-scott-sinclair-never-doubted-hed-be-back-in-brendan-rodgers-plans","story":"Celtic winger Scott Sinclair has insisted he always believed he would be back at the heart of the Parkhead side.

The opportunity concerns how you work with customers and clients to connect into the latest technology to create the best experiences.”Royal Bank of Scotland has long been at the forefront of innovation, from printing the first multi-coloured banknotes in  to installing some of the country’s first ATMs in the s, and it remains at the cutting edge of new financial technology.On its mission to continually develop and update products and features to make banking more convenient and secure for customers, it has invested in new apps to help business customers manage expenses digitally and to give commercial card customers complete control of their account in real time.In , Royal Bank was the first bank to launch a comprehensive internet banking service. Last year it introduced a new ground breaking safety and security feature, face ID. Other recent major steps forward include the launch of Esme Loans, a digital lending  that allows UK-based SMEs to quickly obtain unsecured loans of up to £,, and for personal customers the bank is still the only one to offer completely paperless mortgage applications.Dan Salmons, director of innovation at Royal Bank, added: “I’m tremendously positive about technology. Ultimately, we control it and it’s there to solve problems and to serve us.“Daleks can’t climb stairs, so it will be quite a long time before they take over the world.”Recognising how people live and work in the modern age and finding technology-led solutions to make the customer journey better is at the heart of Royal Bank of Scotland.That ethos has led its development team to design an articial intelligence-powered ‘digital human’ called Cora. Through Cora, Royal Bank of Scotland is the first UK bank to use articial intelligence as a chatbot. Cora converses with customers in branches and can answer more than  queries, including how to log in to online banking, how to apply for a mortgage and what to doyou lose your card, as well as providing advice on card payments and fraud prevention.The last point is particularly relevant: the survey shows  per cent of Scots fear their personal information falling into the wrong hands. It’s more of a concern for women almost two-thirdsof women listed data and personal information as a concern, compared to  per cent of men.Growing up as digital natives,  to -year-olds were the least concerned about protecting their datawhile over-s felt this most strongly . Evidence from this year’s Royal Bank Mobile Microleisure Report also revealed that young people are the least likely of all age groups to take measures such as installing security software on their mobile phones.Royal Bank is focused on designing new measures to help customers stay safe and secure in the virtual world and in real le.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire woman bids land solicitor","story":"NewsAyrshire woman bids to land Solicitor of the Year at the Law Award at Glasgow HiltonMargo McGill is bidding to be crowned at the prestigious awards ceremony for the legal trade.ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV NewsMargo McGill, partner in Lockharts Ayr\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBeing Ayrshire’s only accredited specialist in Agricultural Law, a farmer’s daughter, a farmer’s we and a mother of two farming-mad sons, you would think that Margo McGill loved farming… well you would be right.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

use of the popular events over claims they make too much noise.Silent discos see people dancing and singing to music - they are listening to via headphones.Edinburgh and other cities also have walking tours, combined with silent discos, which have proved a hit with hen parties and tourists.But Edinburgh City Council bosses are set to examine a report looking at an increase in complaints involving pavement obstruction and noise nuisance.Conservative councillor Jo Mowatt said: ldquoSilent discos are not silent.ldquoThere is a lot of whooping and screaming, especially when you have  women on a hen party.ldquoThere is also the safety aspect as who is going to have to step in the road due to the groups taking up the pavements ldquoI have been contacted by many of my constituents regarding silent discos while the Old Town Community Council has been raising this issue for around nine months.Concerns have also been raised about the safety of revellers - saying there was a ldquorisk to

number of traders are taking bookings and payment exclusively online or in a retail premises, meaning they avoid needing a licence.The council has urged traders that it is best practice to seek a licence to guard against the risk of actionone-off payment is received in the streets.But the current legislation leaves the local authorities with limited power in order to take action against silent disco tours.Organisers of a silent disco tour which operates all year round in Edinburgh called for guidelines to be created by the city council to stop ad-hoc tours popping up.Jay Feeney, marketing director of Silent Adventures, said: ldquoWe are the only operators in Edinburgh all year round.ldquoDuring the Fringe there were about four tour operators running - I feel this is a bit of a punishment from the aftermath of the Fringe.ldquoSome of them looked a bit out of control.ldquoWe have always had a big focus on safety and we run tours with absolute control.Mr Feeney said the tours are organised to focus on the Royal Mile and Princes Street, and there is one guide per  people.People from the ages of five years old to  have taken part, including many Edinburgh residents.He added: ldquoI did worry during the Fringe period that some of the other groups would get us all in trouble.ldquoI do feel there should be standards across the board, and Irsquove contacted the council.ldquoI thinkthey look at the way we operate they will be pleasantly surprised.ldquoIt would be a huge shame for the citythere was a ban.ldquoWe are completely aligned with some of the concerns raised.In , the Swiss city of Lausanne banned outdoor silent discos due to noise complaints.Local politicians have written to the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government in order to update lawmakers on the issue.Councillor Mowatt feels there may be existing legislation available to use, it is just a case of finding it.She added: ldquoI am always wary of introducing new legislation.ldquoI feel there may be something in the legislation box already at our disposal and I think we need to double our efforts to seethere is something that already exists which we can use.ldquoTherersquos not a lot we

Certainly the second referendum also involved ignorance of the consequences of the vote. However, it is not only unreasonable but dishonest to pretend that any single person, either among Lord Kerrrsquos network of European contacts or in the EU-funded departments of our universities, could master the mass of entangled detail implicit in the Acquis Communautaire which remains inviolable.It is preposterous to suggest that either Theresa May or British voters could begin to grasp the implications of an agreement on leaving the EU.

Not the Cabinets, nor the Governments, nor two previous Brexit ministers, nor even her own partys.The idea of a tour smacks of hypocrisy in that the PM has been forced, it would seem, to appeal directly to the public: the same public who have repeatedly been refused the opportunity of expressing their views on the deal by the accepted democratic process ndash a referendum or a General Election. To call it a second referendum is a misnomer. Only now that we have a clearer idea of the\"only\" deal available, it would be a referendum to enable the public to express their views on this and, inescapably, other possible options: to back the PMs deal, to dump it and go for a hard Brexit, or to withdraw the UKs Article  letter and remain within the EU along with our  partners.J Napier,A Park Street, Alva.WHAT the UK voted for two and a half years ago was to leave the European Union. Plain and simple. There was no mention then of a deal or no deal being any part of the equation. The vote to leave was taken by the hoi polloi in the face of the bared teeth of the Governmentrsquos taxpayer funded \"project fear\" that leaving would be simply apocalyptical.In the last few days we have now been told by the Establishmentrsquos bought and paid for economists and puppet politicians that leaving, without some unspecied deal, would be an unmitigatedcatastrophe. That, of course, would be the self-same economists who told us it would be a diabolical disasterwe did not adopt the Euro as a currency, who critically failed to see the painfully obvious vicissitude leading to the cataclysm of the  financial crash and who confidently, but again incorrectly, predicted that the entire British Isles would instantly disappear below the waves of the North Seawe voted to leave on June , .D H Telford, Highfield Terrace, Fairlie.THE latest Brexit negotiations are dficult to understand, perhaps because our Government wants it this way. To those who wish to leave, I would say I salute you for your selfless acceptance of hardship for you and your children for many years to come. For those who wish to take back control I would say, did you notice the Great Repeal Act, which took all of European law into our own law and thus made a mockery of this  To those who wish to control immigration I would say, where are all the additional personnel and border controls necessary to accomplish this James Evans, Highmains Avenue, Dumbarton.IN campaigning for the UK to remain in the single market and the customs union, Nicola Sturgeon plays political games with our future.The reality is that she strongly suspects her stated objective wont materialise ndash surely she seeks the opposite of what she is publicly claiming  Doubtless Ms Sturgeon has her fingers firmly crossed that the UK doesnt stay in a strong, formal relationship with the EU.

It did not elaborate on this point. Campaigners believe that SLPs would be harder to abusethere was an accountable person who answered for any illegal conduct overseas.The FT also said proposed legislation was also likely to enable the striking off of SLPs. As things stand nobody can even be entirely sure how many SLPs are active. That is because a dissolved partnership can be re-activated in a way that would be impossible for a limited company.The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it did not comment on leaks.The FT linked government moves with a money-laundering scandal at the Estonian branch of Danske Bank. This saw billions of dollars pumped through shell companies - with unnamed British ones ranking second only to those from Russia.SLPs have proved more popular than some equivalent English or Northern Irish entities because they have legal personality.But like other shell firms registered in the UK they essentially act as a respectable EU-based front for untraceable money transfers. Many have had accounts at banks in the Baltic states, such as Estonia.A crackdown in that region has seen hundreds of SLPs lose their accounts, including in Latviarsquos Rietumu banka, an institution part owned by Celtic owner Dermot Desmond.Latvian authorities, argue insiders sceptical about Britainrsquos commitment to transparency, have now done more to stop abuse of SLPs than British ones. More than half of the offshore companies with accounts in its banks were found to be from the UK or its overseas territories.The countryrsquos ambassador to the UK, Baiba Bra#e, told The Herald the time had come for other nations to act. She said: ldquoWe do think the clean up act has to be done not only in Latvia but where. There are a lot of things that the UK can do.She added: ldquoWhen some of the money-laundering channels were looked in to, almost all of the trends went back to the UK.ldquoAlmost none of the money laundering was created or came from Latvian banks. It all came via companies in London or the Virgin Islands, or Scottish limited partnerships.Ms Bra#e acknowledged that Latvia had been on a ldquogradual learning process on offshore companies using its banks.UK authorities have also been slow, say critics. It is three and a half years since The Herald revealed SLPs were being openly marketed as secrecy vehicles - along with Baltic bank accounts.Money-laundering expert Graham Barrow told the FT: ldquoWe should applaud the government for taking this action and it is moving in the right direction but ultimately it will succeed or fail based on the resources given to Companies House.

This includes those near Bennachie and those through Inverurie on the existing A.”The removal of the plan to upgrade the A through the Bennachie Special Landscape Area has been welcomed by Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin.Last month, Ms Martin welcomed campaigners from the Save Bennachie group to meet with new Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to discuss their concerns.The group also previously met with then Economy Minister Keith Brown earlier this year to discuss their opposition to the plans.Ms Martin MSP said: “I am thrilled Transport Secretary Michael Matheson has confirmed the route passing Bennachie has now been dropped.“The Save Bennachie group have tirelessly campaigned and shown true passion and dedication for their cause.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Macdonald Pittodrie House has been shortlisted for the Wedding of the Year category\"  North east hotel makes award finals viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“I commend them all for a campaign which has been time-consuming and, those who were a part of it, for their commitment and determination.“They managed to achieve cross-party support and I know MSPs from all parties shared a collective admiration for them.“I would like to thank the Transport Minister and Transport Scotland for all their work to date and for taking the time to meet with myself, other MSPs and the Save Bennachie team to listen to their views. Their hard work has paid off.”North East MSP Mike Rumbles added: \"I’m delighted that the Scottish Government has decided to remove possible routes for the A that would damage the natural environment around Bennachie.\"I have no idea why it has taken so long for the minister and Transport Scotland to make this commitment. The option to ert the dual carriageway south of Inverurie and over the foothills of Bennachie should never have been on the table in the first place.“I have met with the transport minister and local campaigners here in the Parliament on several occasions and I can categorically say that it is thanks to their tireless efforts that we are seeing this progress today.“I look forward to exploring the

mark","story":"Staff, parents and children of Logie Durno School gathered together on Friday afternoon to pay tribute to a local father.A remembrance event was held for Mark Mathers, who sadly died following an accident at his work on September .The green balloons were released by Marks family and friendsWhile taking part in the remembrance event, pupils wore ribbons that were green - Mark’s favourite colour.School pupils sang a number of songs at the event before Mark’s family released nine green biodegradable balloons.After the remembrance event was over, Mark’s we Deborah and sons Connor, Arron and Blair presented a cheque for £, to representatives of the Grampian Child Bereavement Network .Speaking to the Herald, Deborah said: “The money was raised at Mark’s funeral.The community gathered to watch the balloons float away“After we had the final total myself and Mark’s father thought about what charity we should donate it to.“We looked at ious charites but we thought it made sense to give it to a local charity that was already helping us.“They are the best people for it as they aren’t well known and we want people to be aware of them and what they do.”She added: “The remembrance event was very well done, but it’s tough for the children to fully understand what is going on.“This is such a small community but everyone has shown a lot of community spirt over the last couple of months and the staff at the school have been amazing.Commenting on the donation Jan Sanders of GCBN said: “For us it’s humbling that people going through something so sad like this choose to support us.“It’s an incredible amont to receive and it is a huge privilege to come here today.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_

Albaredahope readers will Make Someones Day on St Andrews Day on November  and to then celebrate our art and culture on Fair Saturday on December  to help raise funds for good causes. Well, thanks to a new campaign by the Scottish Government, we don’t have to imagine the outcome.For that dream will become a reality on November , with people across the country being asked to commit to doing something nice for someone  on St Andrew’s Day.The Maake Someone’s Day initiative aims to celebrate our generous nature.On Saturday, December , we’re also being invited to take part in the first Fair Saturday here, a celebraion of art and culture while raising funds and awareness for charities.A helping hand...making someones day need not cost a penny. Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

Every year I am bowled over by how much the campaign means to families in need throughout the City and Shire.“Applications have soared in recent years and we have been overwhelmed by the generosity of the public in allowing us to address the demand. “This year we are expecting more requests for help than ever before but we are confident that the generous people of the North-east will give what they can to bring the joy of Christmas to families in their communities.”Donations will be accepted at more than  drop-off points. Applications are accepted from professionals working with disadvantaged families until December . Mission Christmas will also be holding a Christmas Jumper Day on December  and welcomes fundraising through other initiatives. There are also opportunities for iniduals, groups and businesses to volunteer at its warehouse sorting presents in Aberdeen.The campaign runs until December .

A recent survey revealed that one in five people had not heard of credit unions, and only two-fths of those questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union. The survey also found that one in four people wrongly believed that credit unions make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign – ‘People, Not Profit’ – aims to highlight that credit unions are not-for-profit organisations, providing loans and savings, and that most people living in Scotland would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live. Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, said: “In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high cost lenders.“A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.“Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Thursday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmConditions at the Churchill Barriers are being monitored today as strong winds and heavy rain sweep over the county.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school. The island is mainly semi-improved grassland and has several sandy beaches together with rocky shorelines and clfs.According to the council, Faray had a population of  in , falling to  by . By the late s, there were eight crofting families living on the island, making a living through lobster fishing.

I am suddenly all overcome with dizziness and sweats. Without time to see my doctor I have self-diagnosed using Google and Wikipedia that I am suffering a complete loss of nerve after agreeing with Prime #Minister Theresa May.She is right. It might be the only time and the only thing she is right about, but in a certain sense I am Bored of Brexit. Apparently this new phenomenon called BoB is neither a virus or congenital defect – I am simply pig-sick of the never-ending drawn-out EU negotiations that have lasted twice as long as Mao’s Long March.What’s more, no sooner have the EU  nations signed the orce settlementand have said we can’t change a single word, when – surprise, surprise – France’s President Macron is saying how he’ll bully and blackmail us so his fishermen get as much access to our fishing waters as they want.Bored of Brexit  You bet I am. I am bored with how we always cough-up our nation’s hard-earned taxes to keep the EU juggernaut hurtling between its two lavish parliaments.I’m bored with how we’re expected to sign up to new rules and regulations ­without a say in them. I’m bored with how EU politicians say there is a problem with the UK-Irish border are the same people who say that under no circumstances will they impose a hard border or any infrastructure – so what’s the problem I’m bored with being told we can have new trade deals – only to read QCs’ opinions that say it won’t be ­possible under May’s orce ­settlement and then hear President Trump agree, saying the US won’t do a deal now.It is this parade of our ­Premier May’s prize porkies that is the most boring aspect of it all. Every time she makes a claim about leaving behind the single market, its customs union, or those European judges, or ending unlimited immigration – I then find when I read the detail in the official documents that it is simply not true. These institutions are replicated and given new names, or there are caveats that keep us locked in –the EU leaders decide by themselves!One can only conclude the Prime Minister is trying to fool us by repeatedly parroting black is white or has talked herself into believing her own publicity without using her critical faculties – what is normally considered self-delusion. Neither of these behaviours are a good look.The prize example is the PM says that because we’re Bored of Brexit we must agree her orce settlement so we can move on to our new lives. This is the biggest lie of all. It is May’s withdrawal agreement that guarantees another two years of further negotiations until the end of  – with the threat of being kept in beyond that. French and Spanish leaders have made that very plain and the rest will be queuing up to give us another doing every other month. What we need is a clean break. To end the boredom we need to simply leave. The referendum question didn’t askwe wanted a new deal, it askedwe wanted to remain or leave – with or without a deal. We don’t actually need a deal – it’s how normal countries work. We can keep our £ billion for our own problems, trade with no ­tarfs to bring prices down and decide our fisheries’ future. The aircraft will still fly and we can visit countries like we do now.No longer will we be bored with Brexit – and we can get back to disagreeing about everything  instead! ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4835746.1543348948!/image/image.jpg","title":"how to bridge scotland s attainment gap dr geetha marcus","story":"We need to think outside the box when reimagining Scotland#s education system, writes Dr Geetha MarcusThe UK has one of the most socially segregated school systems in the developed world, with academic selection – where children are admitted to a school on the basis of ability – and parental choice at its core.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentbelieves this has a negative impact on social equality and a young person’s ability to earn a good income in the future. OECD evidence shows that segregated schools present children with two dferent perspectives of the world and affect their le chances.Effects of povertyThere is a strong link between a pupil’s socioeconomic status and how well they do in school. Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds have a higher chance of failing. Children and young people living in the most deprived communities do signicantly worse at all levels of the education system than those from more affluent backgrounds. This is often referred to as the “attainment gap”.In Scotland, it is estimated that one in four children is living in poverty. European Commission figures suggest this is higher than in many other countries in Europe and the Institute for Fiscal Studiespredicts that more than one-third of children in the UK will be living in poverty by  .• : Scottish schools struggle to fill nearly  teaching postsIn , Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, declared that the Scottish government would “draw on successful ideas from around the world” to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds and close the attainment gap. She introduced a range of initiatives, not only in the education sector, but across health, childcare, social services, welfare and employment. Some of these measures introduced as a matter of urgency have already proved controversial, such as the national testing of P pupilswhich parents and teachers complained had caused some children distress. Schools play a signicant role, but the initiatives adopted need to follow a long arc of slow structural change. Short-term political fixes have been tried for decades, yet people in Scotland and the rest of the UK continue to live in a deeply unequal society ided by class, income and poverty.Following the FinnsFinland is widely recognised as being an educational success story. Like Scotland, it has a population of around five million which shares the same culture, language and a keen sense of social justice. But after the Second World War the Finns recognised that a society ided by class and poverty would weaken their country further, so they embarked on long-term structural reform abolishing private and selective schools in favour of a system in which every child would attend high-quality state schools. The Finns reduced socio-economic inequality by reducing inequality in the education system.Having dferent educational provisions and greater freedom for parents to choose their preferred school may seem democratic, but it leads to a country that separates children and damages the very fabric of democracy it seeks to champion. I think there are three fundamental ways to help bridge the educational ide in Scotland.First, as the Finns have done, the government should look beyond parental choice and introduce the “common school” which provides basic comprehensive education to serve all children equally well, regardless of family background. Not just a form of school organisation, the idea of the common school embodies a philosophy of education as well as a deep set of values about what all children need and deserve.Second, the quality of teachers and teaching is crucial for effective learning and can have a demonstrable impact on a disadvantaged pupil’s prospects. Teachers need to be paid at a level that will attract top graduates, so that the profession becomes more appealing and valued.According to the OECD the UK has one of the least well-paid and youngest teaching workforces in the EU, predominantly populated by women. Because teaching is a highly skilled profession, only teachers who are academically well-qualied, research literate and socially committed should be encouraged to teach Scotland’s children.Freedom and trustA long-term solution for reducing the attainment gap is to restore a culture of responsibility and trust within the education system that values teacher and head teacher professionalism in judging what is best for students. The Scottish Government has pledged £m directly to head teachers, which although considered a sound idea by the OECD, has been met with concern due to a lack of clear guidance on how this money should be spent.Striking a balance between accountability and autonomy, with greater levels of responsibility, flexibility and freedom to be creative in addressing pupils’ needs takes time. Research suggests that encouraging schools to make their own decisions about how best to support their pupils to do well is essential for closing the attainment gap.Third, the standard of literacy has fallen in Scotland over the past four years. Literacy and le chances are closely linked, and evidence suggests that libraries can contribute to improving quality of le for all. Starting with areas that have been designated as deprived, new public libraries should be built or existing community libraries transformed.Raising the level of literacy is not just about the child, it has to involve the literacy of families and communities too. As we see in places such as Finland and Singapore, public libraries can serve as the educational and cultural bedrock of a community, and could help work towards closing the attainment gap.Persistent poverty exacerbated by budget cuts and coupled with entrenched mindsets in government and education are all obstacles in the current climate.There is an urgent need to think out of the box and to re-imagine long-term solutions to reverse the inequalities that face disadvantaged children in Scotland.• Geetha Marcus is lecturer in education at the School of Interdisciplinary Studies, University of GlasgowThis article first appeared at theconversation©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4832648.1543436485!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may tells nicola sturgeon stop exploiting brexit for scottish independence","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May has insisted Scotland#s business leaders are behind her Brexit deal as she warned Nicola Sturgeon to stop exploiting the issue to push for a second referendum.The Prime Minister used a flying visit north of the Border yesterday to dismiss the Scottish Government’s report this week which suggested Scotland would be £ billion worse off under the proposed deal.Mrs May visited the Scottish Leather Group in Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire, where she met workers and staff to make the case for the deal she has struck with Brussels. It was the latest stop on her nationwide tour to sell her plan directly to the people as defeat in the House of Commons looks increasingly likely in a fortnight.: No-deal Brexit warning from Bank of England: ‘Pound will crash and inflation will soar’The Prime Minister accused opponents of seeking to undermine Brexit after Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell suggested that a second referendum on Brexit was now “inevitable”.The Tory leader made it clear that Ms Sturgeon is facing a flat refusal when, as expected, the Scottish Government next year seeks a “section ” order from Westminster to allow a second independence referendum. The Prime Minister instead insisted Brexit is a UK-wide issue.: Analysis shows economy would be .% smaller under Theresa May’s Brexit deal“Now is not the time to be thinking about this,” Mrs May said.“The United Kingdom faces a really important decision, it’s a historic moment for the UK. We entered the EEC, as it was, as a whole UK, we’re leaving the EU as a whole United Kingdom.“What we’ve negotiated is a Brexit deal that is good for the UK as a whole, it’s good for Scotland. It’s good for employers like Bridge of Weir here, it’s good for Scottish fishermen. Support for deal has been encouraged by employers like Diageo, organisations like the Scotch Whisky Association and the NationalFarmers Union of Scotland.“One thing we do know is that what would be bad for the Scottish economy would be taking Scotland out of the United Kingdom.”Scottish Government research published this week’s indicated that the economic impact of the free trade deal would see Scots lose out the tune of about £ per head, compared with staying in the EU.The figures had been set out in a previous Scottish Government report from January The Prime Minister said: “As I understand it what they didn’t do was actually model or look at the deal that we have negotiated and the specics of the deal that the Government has proposed.“The one thing I do know is that what would have most economic impact on the Scottish economywould beScotland was to become independent from the United Kingdom.“It is the internal market of the UK that is four times greater for Scotland than the market with the European Union.”She also claimed “Scotland’s interests have been taken into account throughout the negotiations we’ve been doing”, arguing that leaving Europe gives the UK the chance to negotiate its own trade deals, which could help “iconic Scottish products like smoked salmon and Scotch whisky”.“There have been a number of employers here in Scotland, and organisations here in Scotland that have said that support for the deal is important,” Mrs may added.“I’ve been hearing today in Bridge of Weir about the importance of a Free Trade area for the supply chains that the company and others in Scotland depend on. That’s what we’re proposing that’s what we’ve put forward that’s what we’ve got in the political declaration. No tarfs, no fees - free trade area.

Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"views sought on fishing after brexit ","story":"“What will Brexit mean for your fishing community ” – was the question posed by university academics this week.But sadly the public event on Wednesday night at the Thule Bar in Lerwick did not pull in visitors to share their views.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He said: \"It is great that the council and Macdonald Hotels have listened to the concerns of the community and that a pragmaticto talks has delivered this deal.\"I know as a father myself that folk across the strath will be really looking forward to getting backing into the swimming pool with their children and other families members.\"Id like to thank everyone who wrote correspondence to Macdonald Hotels, attended the public meetings and demonstrations and who helped to fund the SOS  campaign.\"It all goes to show what can be achieve with a bit of community spirit.\"Judith Thurlow, chair of Aviemore Primary School parents council, was also absolutely delighted.\"This is a leline for so many members of our community and an essential skill for the local children to learn,\" she said.\"Thank you to everyone in the community who has persevered, shown great resilience and played a part in reaching this really positive outcome.\"Pupils from the school had written to Mr Macdonald imploring him to let them go swimming again and local GPs and aquafit users ndash some in their eighties ndash had also gone public with their health concerns.There had also been several peaceful protests at the resort by SOS  in the aftermath of the decision.The Strathy tried yesterday to contact the council and Macdonald Hotels for further information on the new funding arrangements and when the doors will actually re-open for HLH cardholders but there was no response.It is understood the hotel giant had initially in the spring asked for pound, in year one pound, in year two and pound, in

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Thursday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England. On hishe took the Republican side in the Civil War and saw action against the Free Staters.John James Kelly was a man of the left - he spoke often to his son about Lenin. In the s and s, because of his Republican views, he found it dficult to make a living but he remained in the IRA and was elected to its Executive Council. He was  years old when he died.CharlieMcCafferty was OC of the IRAs st Tir Conaill Battalionat the time of his death. He was born in  and he too joined the IRA at a young age. In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours. They were buried eighty years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"football tops at coca cola plant causing division says local man","story":"A COCA-COLA worker has described working conditions at the multinational’s Lambeg plant as “intimidating and antagonising” for Catholic employees as breaches of the company’s policy on work clothing are on the rise.The man said that though the wearing of football tops is expressly banned, Rangers and Northern Ireland jerseys are routinely worn by members of staff with no action being taken. And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newly published childrens book aims to teach important message for a worthy cause","story":"A new children’s book, designed to introduce small children to the world’s big issues and aid vital charity work, is the latest work of West Belfast woman Arlene Gormley.Co-founder of the Feeding Dreams Cambodia charity, Arlene has penned, designed and illustrated ‘ Not A Fairytale’ describing how even from a young age we can work to make the planet better for now and future generations.Feeding Dreams Cambodia was founded in  and offers free education and nutrition for  children in Cambodia’s tourist capital of Siem Reap. The charity receives no government funding and relies solely on donations, most of which comes from support and fundraising drives in Belfast. Arlene explained how the book is based on the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goalsthat recognise ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education.“Our approach at Feeding Dreams is holistic,” explained Arlene. “ Our programmes in education, medical care, community support, vocational training, they are all interlinked, so when the UN announced the  Goals, it helped give us the framework and language for our strategy. Since each of our programmes can be tied to one of the  SDGs and the Cambodian government ratied the SDGs, it gave us legitimacy and credibility.”“I decided to create a handmade book introducing the SDGs to young children through colourful pictures with simplistic explanations. The book was originally intended as a keepsake for my four-year-old niece Zara but the message has struck a chord with parents and teachers. I’m holding a book launch on Saturday in the city centre’s Learning Space store and all sales from the book will go towards the work of the charity. “During the Christmas period people are very generous with their donations but it’s when all the rush calms down and we go into what we call our ‘leaner’ months of January, February that we need that extra push make sure all the children receive a proper, balanced meal.”Arlene became a mother herself in August and is now more determined than ever to ensure her daughter Julia has a keen understanding of the world around her.“Children are born into an uncertain and unequal world and parents worry about the kind of environment their children grow up in. It’s important to me that my daughter understands from a early age about important issues that will affect her future, like climate change, access to health and education, and the importance of equality.” The Queen’s University graduate spoke of how the visually striking picture book was “something a little dferent” for the bedtime hour. “It’s a great way to sit with a child and read each chapter, look at the illustrations, it’s a great tool to show what is going on in the world and at the same time contribute to the work of Feeding Dreams.”Arlene will be signing copies of her book at Fountain Centre’s Learning Space store on Saturday, December  from am until noon. Not A Fairytale is priced at £.

More than , local children live in homes haunted by poverty.That means families with increasing debts, choices between ‘heat or eat’, teenagers with a limited or non-existent social le and an increased risk of chronic illness.”She continued: “Children living in poverty also consistently underperform at school and find it harder to get a job when they leave.“The highest levels of poverty are to be found in the Colin Glen and Falls areas,” she added.North Belfast follows closely behind the West Belfast statistics with , children living in child poverty. In South Belfast the figures are just over half of this with , children affected. East Belfast stands at ,.Research by Save the Children has shown that around  per cent of parents in poverty say their children have to go without new shoes when they need them and a large number of children in poverty say they are missing out on things that many other children take for granted, such as going on school trips and having a warm coat in winter.“The introduction of Universal Credit, cuts to health and education budgets, pressures on community, voluntary and youth services all compound the problems already affecting thousands of local families – many of them with a least one partner working, it is unforgivable,” said Ms Lowry.“While in Government Sinn Féin and the DUP refused to implement the promised Anti- Poverty Strategy and sent powers relating to Universal Credit to Westminster. As a result thousands of local children and their families continue to suffer a hardship and deprivation that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.“If there is a more important political priority in West Belfast than addressing child poverty, then perhaps some local MLAs would like to tell me about it.”Commenting on the report and its findings West Belfast MP Paul Maskey said that the issue of child poverty needs to #reduce and reduce rapidly#.#In my view one child living in poverty is one too many.

The leading architect revealed he had received more than a dozen unsolicited emails from engineers and geologists inquiring about the project since the speech on Saturday. “It has been bubbling along since January,” said Professor Dunlop. “I thought that was the end of it, and then something  happens.“And then with Boris Johnson, Karen Bradley and the DUP bringing it up again, it just seems like a potential story and narrative which keeps moving on.”Last week the bridge was raised during a discussion in the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in Westminster. Responding to a question from the DUP’s Ian Paisley, Secretary of State Karen Bradley said she was willing to have a discussion about commissioning a feasibility study on the bridge, but noted there were issues around the sea bed and the current site of the proposed bridge link. Addressing the DUP annual conference on Saturday, former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said proposals for a bridge link were being held back by the “absence of political will”. “I think that there will be a feasibility study, which is all I can ask for. That’s all I’ve ever asked for,” said Professor Dunlop.“I am not suggesting for a moment it is going to be a walk in the park. Instead people providing opinions about whether it can be done or not, it would be good to actually get the facts.”Boris Johnson backs bridge linking Northern Ireland and ScotlandSDLP MLA criticises Paisley for obsessing over Northern Ireland to Scotland bridgeMr Johnson first expressed his support for a bridge back in June, when he called for the proposal to be taken “seriously”. Mr Dunlop first envisioned the idea for the bridge link after being asked to do so by a newspaper in Scotland. He laid out two proposals for the route — one from Larne and Portpatrick, potentially costing around £bn or a shorter crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head, which could cost between £bn and £bn.The proposal received a boost in March after a spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would “initiate discussions to explore improving connectivity” between the island of Ireland and Scotland, adding it was important “that all options are fully considered”."},{"url":null,"title":"tributes paid after pride of ardoyne bandsman passes away","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sinn Feins OMuilleoir pleased summons for driving charge withdrawn  Alex Kane: Northern Ireland plc took its Brexit case to Downing Street because there was no one at home on the Hill The Taoiseach said he had followed proceedings of the Northern Ireland inquiry into the so-called “cash for ash scheme” which caused the collapse of the Belfast power-sharing government in January .Mr Varadkar said he was surprised to learn that Sinn Fein had a greater role than was earlier realised. He pointed to emails, unearthed in the inquiry, from then Sinn Fein finance minister in Belfast, Mairtin O Muilleoir.The Taoiseach said Mr O Muilleoir had at one point emailed “a senior republican,” Ted Howell, who did not hold any elected office, seeking clearance to sign-off for a business plan related to the heating scheme by Wednesday.“That is documentary evidence that Sinn Fein ministers seek approval and consent from ‘senior republicans’ when it comes to major decisions in government,” Mr Varadkar told the Dail.“I’m just curious to knowDeputy McDonald would want to  comment on that, or expand on that, and maybe inform us of the extent she and her front bench require approval from senior republicans for decisions,” the Taoiseach added.The Sinn Fein leader said the Taoiseach should await publication of the full report on the controversial Northern Ireland heat scheme. She said it would record “the central role of the DUP in the affair.”“At that stage you can make your assessment on an informed basis,” Ms McDonald said.Ms McDonald accused Fine Gael and Fianna Fail of “playing politics” with Northern Irelands current problems and said the Government had an obligation under the Good Friday Agreement to be impartial.

The DUP are pro-Brexit,” Ms McDonald said. She added that the party is ready to try again to get the North’s power-sharing up and running, and the party was very disappointed when a near-agreement with the DUP last February failed.Mr Martin criticised Sinn Fein for not taking its seven Westminster seats as Ireland faced the biggest economic challenge in  years, while the absence of a Northern Ireland power-sharing government and parliament left Northern Ireland without a voice. He added that Sinn Fein was more involved in the “cash for ash” than earlier thought.The Taoiseach said Sinn Fein’s absence from Westminster was about more than parliamentary numbers for a crucial vote for next month.

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though. I will continue my work and hope that many more will follow.Dara recently worked with Springwatch presenter Chris Packham on The Peoplersquos Walk for Wildlecampaign.He spoke to , people at Hyde Park about conservation and also completed a -mile walk that raised over pound, to tag and record threatened birds of prey.He is soon to publish a book called lsquoDiary of a Young Naturalistrsquo based on his blog, which won runner-up in the BBC Wildle Magazine Blogger Awards.Charlotte Hill, CEO of Step Up To Serve, which coordinates the #iwill campaign, said: ldquoWe know that young people have the energy, ideas and drive to address issues in their community and to tackle many of societyrsquos tougher challenges.ldquoWe are so pleased to see the Prime Minister recognising the astounding achievements that Dara has made through his volunteering, fundraising and campaigning, and hope this inspires Dara and other young people to continue their fantastic work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Class act Connolly secures final spot  ","story":"RYAN Connolly was the hero of the hour as Olympic claimed their spot in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final and also claimed the bragging rights in Ballynahinch.Connolly made two saves in the penalty shoot-out and then converted the decisive spot kick at the end of a largely forgettable semi-final at Bignian Park on Friday night.Olympic will face either Killough or Celtic Bhoys, who meet this Friday night in the second semi-final at the same venue, in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Boxing Day showpiece at Drumaness.There was little to cheer the good-sized crowd who braved the Mourne chill well into the night.One hundred and ten minutes of football produced barely a handful of chances, which meant that all the excitement was reserved for the spot kick shoot-out.Connolly had little to do over normal and extra time, but he produced the goods when it mattered and was mobbed by his delighted team-mates after putting his spot kick past Raymond Tate in the YM goal.However, Olympic know they will have up their gamethey are to pose a threat to either Killough or Celtic Bhoys in the final.Neither they nor YM could be faulted for effort. The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out.

The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the key issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning altogether unsorted black bin bag waste. Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

work on finding a better way forward, a DUP MP has said.Ian Paisley was responding to comments made by Chancellor Philip Hammond about government analysis which suggests the UK will be economically poorer under any version of Brexit, but much worse offit crashes out of the EU with no deal.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond arrives at the Crown Plaza Hotel in Belfast last Friday for a private dinner with DUP leader Arlene FosterAccording to the official figures, produced by officials from several Whitehall departments including the Treasury, the Department for Exiting the EU, Industry, Environment, International Trade and the Home Office:• Withdrawal from the European Union under the government’s plans could cut the UK’s GDP by up to .% over the next  years • Leaving without a deal could deliver a .% hit to GDP over the same period.The document did not put a cash figure on the potential impact on the economy, but independent experts have said that .% of GDP would equate to around £ billion a year by the s, far outweighing the UK’s current contribution to EU budgets.Ian Paisley MPMeanwhile, the Long-Term Economic Analysis paper found that government borrowing could be forced up by as much as £ billion by the UK quit the EU without a deal, and up to £. billion under a scenario similar to Mrs May’s plans.The government figures suggest Northern Ireland, the North East, North West and West Midlands would be hardest-hit by a no-deal Brexit.The -page document was released as Prime Minister Theresa May continued to tour the UK to promote her deal to voters ahead of the crucial House of Commons vote on December .On Wednesday Mr Hammond acknowledged that all possible Brexit options will make the UK poorer in economic terms, compared with remaining in the EU. But he insisted that the PM’s plan – agreed by EU leaders at a Brussels summit last Sunday – would “minimise” the economic damage.Reacting to the analysis, Sinn Fein’s Northern Ireland leader Michelle O’Neill claimed it “confirms the absurdity of the DUP’s position on Brexit” and called on the party to “accept that, while there is no good Brexit, the withdrawal agreement is the least worst option available”.“Brexit is economic vandalism and it beggars belief that the DUP is still prepared to crash our economy in pursuit of a reckless unionist agenda,” she said.Responding, Mr Paisley said: “Sinn Fein have accepted the chancellor’s analysis and so are knowingly canvassing support for something which would damage our economy.

Others may wish to give up, but the DUP wants to see a better way forward and an agreement that can benefit all parts of the United Kingdom.”Arguing that Mr Hammond’s comments “highlight the need to seek a better deal”, the North Antrim MP continued: “Once again the public are being faced with a  choice when the chancellor frames his economic predictions between either the withdrawal agreement as it currently stands or leaving the EU with no deal.“What the chancellor does recognise, however, is that the withdrawal agreement is not good for the United Kingdom. Last week the chancellor admitted the backstop is bad for the economy and bad for the Union. There is no enthusiasm for this deal and it appears destined to be rejected by Parliament.“Now is the time to look beyond the current deal, to bin the backstop and work on finding a better way forward. This process could commence now instead of waiting until after the House of Commons has its say and the government is then directed to think again. It’s time to grasp the nettle and seek a better way forward.”try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Plans have now been submitted to construct the homes close to Sprucefield, outside Lisburn. It would also involve a new link road on the M motorway. An initial pre-application notice was issued for the scheme last year, but now the developer behind the scheme – Neptune Carleton – has submitted an outline planning application for the ambitious project. If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years. Elsewhere, this week a major £m housing development in Larne was awarded outline planning permission. Nuport Developments has been given the early go-ahead for  houses on the -acre site at Ballyboley in the town. The Ballyclare-based developer is now expected to progress to a more detailed plan for the housing scheme.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/may_1.jpg","title":"the brexit draft agreement business reaction","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew The publication of a draft agreement between the Prime Minister and Brussels over the UK’s exit has caused a huge stir among the political institutions. Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
