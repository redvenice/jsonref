I\u0027ll do it for a lot, a lot of money.\u0027Lee said he is on board too, \u0027If I get to hang out with these guys again.\u0027Lee admitted that the film\u0027s executive producers and creative minds May and Taylor would have to join them to make the movie a success again.He said: \u0027Queen refer to themselves as being like a family and I think it was something that we were really adamant that we wanted to capture, and so we were very lucky to have their blessing. \u0027Like from day one when we were in rehearsals, we had Brian May and Roger Taylor there on set and they were never critical or judgmental.\u0027They were only ever supportive and so that just gave us such confidence from the outset really.\u0027Earlier this week Rudi Dolezal - who directed videos for the band and became close with Mercury during his life - told Page Six in an interview about Queen\u0027s legendary manager Jim Beach, \u0027I\u0027m sure he plans a sequel that starts with Live Aid.\u0027Dolezal added that the follow-up film is now \u0027being heavily discussed in the Queen family.\u0027Queen movie claims our brother Paul tried to seduce Freddie...Axed man: Bryan Singer is fired from Red Sonja reboot after...Share this article    Both actors said the cast is keen to reprise their roles in the Oscar-winning blockbuster, which has grossed nearly $1billion worldwide          \u0027Brian and Roger always talked about that fact that their zenith, them at their finest was in 1986 when they did the Wembley concerts,\u0027 the actors confessed. Brian May (left) and Roger Taylor (right) are pictured with Rami Malek after winning the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Freddie Mercury Mazzello insisted that Malek, May and Taylor were all confident that the film would be a success despite early critical negative reviews, upset from some Queen fans and drama with the exit of controversial director Bryan Singer.The cast and crew were unfazed at the drama on and off of the film, which earned four Oscars and a nominations for Best Picture last month.Their focus and confidence proved right as  Bohemian Rhapsody   has grossed over $875m at the box office.            Bohemian Rhapsody has grossed over $875million dollars worldwide and the stars reveal Mazzello said: \u0027For me, I never felt that roller coaster, because we were really in it and we knew we were making something brilliant. We knew that with the performances that we had, with the support that we had with Queen at our side that we couldn\u0027t fail. And so I\u0027ll speak for myself, I never worried about this movie ever and I knew that people were really going to respond to it.\u0027Did I know they were going to respond to it in the tune of 850 million dollars worldwide? No, I didn\u0027t know that much, and so that has been a real pleasure to see that kind of validation for all of the hard work that we put in and what we believe this movie could be.\u0027Lee confirmed their confidence and decided to ignore the critics and the negative headlines: \u0027We knew if we could tap into just a little bit of Queen\u0027s magic.\u0027They have an ability to communicate to so many people, and I thought if we could tap into that, then we\u0027ll have something special and I think we did. I read one review right at the beginning and I just thought, \u0027\u0027It\u0027s not for me.\u0027\u0027\u0027Some critics had their preconceived ideas about what they wanted the film to be, but what I think is brilliant about the audiences that have been going to see it in the masses, I think they take it on its merits. They see it for what it is and take it to heart.\u0027 Lee expressed his delight at the Awards seasons success: \u0027The whole film just feels like a celebration.\u0027, while Mazzello added: \u0027So as long as we are together, we\u0027re having fun, we\u0027re enjoying it, this whole thing is just a blessing.

She also enjoys a reputation as a wily political operator with deep roots in the Democrat and New Labour camps.          Ms Latham is an American with duel citizenship and has her roots in the Democrat party and New Labour. She has worked with Tony Blair, She was brought in to help choreograph Bill Clinton’s re-election campaign in 1996, helped to sneak in Barack Obama’s proposed Cabinet nominations for secret interviews after his election in 2008, and helped prepare Hillary Clinton for the White House as part of what was described as her ‘covert operations team’. There may have been an added attraction for what appears to have been a selection made by the duchess, rather than Prince Harry.She hasn’t hidden her loathing of Donald Trump, describing him on US TV as ‘misogynistic’ and publicly supporting Mrs Clinton’s rival presidential campaign.Appointing a PR chief with a long-standing link to the Clintons – who of course Mr Trump hates – may be seen as a snub to the president.\u0027This appalling atrocity is an assault on all of us\u0027: Young...\u0027Loved up\u0027 Princess Beatrice and beau Edoardo Mozzi spark...Share this articleSources say the couple met Miss Latham, 48, only this year and were immediately drawn to her ‘firm but fair approach’. It is possible they were introduced via the duchess’s Hollywood friend George Clooney, whose wife Amal attended Meghan’s recent – and lavish – ‘baby shower’ festivities in New York.Clooney was involved in raising funds for the Hillary campaign.A former colleague yesterday described Miss Latham as ‘very smart and very good at dealing with difficult characters’. She is, he added, ‘very diplomatically adept’ and ‘not in it for the money’.It is estimated she is on a salary of £140,000 which is relatively modest for what she could be earning in the corporate sector. Miss Latham had recently rejoined the London PR firm, Freuds, as its managing partner.          Ms Latham was brought in to help choreograph Bill Clinton’s re-election campaign in 1996, helped to sneak in Barack Obama’s proposed Cabinet nominations for secret interviews after his election in 2008, and helped prepare Hillary Clinton for the White House as part of what was described as her ‘covert operations team’Reporting to the Queen’s press secretary Donal McCabe, Miss Latham will start her new job in the spring the couple’s baby is rumoured to be expected next month.Miss Latham will no doubt be paid as much as the palace could afford but spinning for the Sussexes would be no job for an amateur.She seems to have risen effortlessly through the political and corporate worlds in a career that has seen her repeatedly assist global figures including allies of the Clintons and Tony Blair.After being brought in for Bill Clinton’s successful 1996 re-election campaign, she worked as special assistant to Mr Clinton’s chief of staff, John Podesta.Between 1996 and 2000, Miss Latham held other White House roles including deputy assistant to the president and, until 2000, deputy director of presidential scheduling. That position brought her close to the then-first lady.After George W Bush won the 2000 presidential election, she moved to Brussels as a government affairs adviser for software giant Microsoft.The next year, she moved again, this time to London to become managing director of Philip Gould Associates, the PR firm set up by the late Lord Gould, the former Labour strategy and polling adviser who was close to Tony Blair.The Blair connection must have helped her move to Freud Communications in 2002. Its founder, Matthew Freud, was not only an ally of Mr Blair, but also had strong Democrat links.In 2005, she was seconded to work for Labour’s general election campaign, after which she was appointed as special adviser to Tessa Jowell, Mr Blair’s culture secretary – just as the department learned London would host the 2012 Olympics.Miss Latham left the Government in 2006 to set up her own consultancy. Naturally, her clients reflected her high-level contacts and included the Clinton Foundation and Tony Blair Associates as well as Coca-Cola and the Nelson Mandela Foundation.          The shake-up comes as Harry and Meghan prepare for their move away from Kensington Palace to Frogmore Cottage (pictured) on the Windsor Castle estateIn 2008, she returned to Washington DC – after a farewell party at a trendy Mayfair bar – to work again for the Democrats. This time she was employed by Barack Obama as he prepared to enter the White House. He had, of course, defeated her old boss Hillary Clinton in a heated battle for the Democrat nomination.But the Clintons endorsed Mr Obama at the party’s 2008 convention, urging supporters to vote for him.An expert, it appears, at helping politicians ‘transition’ into power, Miss Latham doesn’t hang around long in government – nor anywhere else, it seems.By 2011 she had returned to the corporate world as non-executive chairman of iEnergizer, a supplier of ‘back-office’ services to banks which is run by multimillionaire Anil Agarwal.Even in business, she did not allow her political links to wither, and was described in a 2012 report as the ‘go-to girl for top Democrats visiting London’. Miss Latham reportedly advised Michelle Obama on which restaurants to visit in the UK.The year after it was back to politics to join Hillary Clinton’s campaign for president. Miss Latham was appointed chief of staff to John Podesta, now chairman of Mrs Clinton’s campaign. A presidential candidate’s selection of running mate is an enormously sensitive operation. John McCain discovered this when he disastrously chose Sarah Palin in 2009 and internal staff tensions were leaked to the media.Mrs Clinton was determined that shouldn’t happen again and Miss Latham was asked to oversee a VP selection process that was shrouded in secrecy.As part of a ‘covert operations team’, Miss Latham marshalled reports drawn up by 15 law firms asked to vet candidates. She then printed them out in secret and posted them to Mrs Clinton.As Mrs Clinton flew with Senator Tim Kaine – her eventual choice – to the Florida rally where she would break the news, Miss Latham lightened the mood by persuading him to pull out his harmonica. He obliged, playing a Beatles tune.Confident she would win comfortably, Mrs Clinton appointed Miss Latham one of three aides to oversee ‘transition planning’ for her new administration.That particular transition, of course, was never to happen.Sara Latham likes to move on regularly in her career. One hopes for the duke and duchess’s sake she hangs around long enough to handle their often shifting public image. "},{"url":null,"title":"Jeremy Paxman got stuffing Celebrity Bake Off","story":"    Star baker in the making? Quizmaster and BBC veteran presenter Jeremy Paxman is set to appear on episode four of the popular baking show on March 26I will happily admit that I am not a natural baker. Cooking I enjoy. But the closest I generally get to baking is when I make my signature quiche. (Real men not only eat it, but make it.) Even then, there was an occasion last autumn when I forgot to put the eggs into the thing. For some reason, various people found this ludicrous.Baking is — excuse me — a different kettle of fish altogether.In cooking, you taste — and modify — things, as you progress. In baking, you must stick to the recipe. Even a minute or two in the oven or a few degrees difference in temperature can apparently make an enormous difference. Cooking is an art. Baking is a science.The producer brought a tame expert to my home beforehand, to demonstrate what a mixer is. I signed up for a Saturday morning session at a local cookery school. But the closer the fateful day came, the more nervous I became.          Paxman revealed that he has lost several friends to cancer, which is one of the reasons why he decided to take part in the show. He also blames Channel 4 presenter Jon Snow, as he believed his news rival has also agreed to take partJeremy Paxman says MPs like Anna Soubry who complain about...Bake Off star baker Ian is accused of getting secret...Share this articleThey say lambs arriving at the abattoir can sense it’s not a good place to be. On the appointed Saturday morning I knew how they felt.Since it was — mercifully — off-mic and off-camera, I will not disclose what presenter Sandi Toksvig said when we met that day. But it was not the sort of language you associate with the chancellors of universities.Our first task seemed easy enough — to make biscuits in homage to a pet. Since we’d had advance warning, I had brought along a pastry-cutter which vaguely resembled the head of my dog, Derek, an elegant Battersea Dog’s Home mutt.It all began to go wrong when I decided to try to reproduce his markings with something called Royal Icing.Apparently, this is considered easy to make. Perhaps it is, though it didn’t seem so to me.          Paxman is usually more inclined towards grilling university students on BBC quiz show University Challenge, which he has presented since 1994, and has decline several television opportunities including Big Brother and Strictly Come DancingBut it is definitely not easy to apply to ginger biscuits through the nozzle of a plastic bag.Each time I tried to squeeze out a dribble of icing to replicate the dog’s colouring, a volcano erupted at the other end of the bag, covering my hands. Royal Icing is sugar and egg-white. Having it all over your hands does not make precision easier.Poor old Derek would have happily eaten them, of course. But, then he lives on dog biscuits. And he certainly would not have recognised himself.For the ‘technical challenge’ we were asked to make chocolate crumpets, which, frankly, are such a disgusting notion that no self-respecting human being should have a clue what they are.I would not presume to dispense advice about baking, but if any reader is ever inveigled into Crumpet Madness, it is important to take seriously the advice about only half-filling the funny container things with batter.          The presenter claims that Paul Hollywood surprised him by saying that his lemon drizzle cake tasted good, and Prue Leith had taken some of it home with herFor reasons which escape me now, I decided to put a figure of Prue Leith, a fellow fisherperson, on a rock overlooking the water. I think by now I could sniff failure in the air (along with the smell of burning) and was trying to be smarmy.I eventually settled for what I thought was an adequate model of Prue in long raincoat, with what was either a deer-stalker or a sou’wester on her head. She didn’t seem much impressed when she saw it.I didn’t have enough icing to cover the sides, but Paul Hollywood said that it was quite fashionable to leave them in their natural state.I told him that was the look I was going for. But on reflection perhaps he was trying to be diplomatic.And that was it. It took two days and dozens of crew to produce one episode. I am not going to disclose who won our episode and accept that agreeing to take part was an impulsive thing to do. But I shall look forward to seeing Jon Snow put his money where his mouth once apparently was.If nothing else, I have discovered that baking is much harder than it looks but raising money for cancer research is a good enough cause for public humiliation.True, it was insulting for the producers to try to confiscate our phones in case we looked up help online: as if any of us cared enough to cheat.And I’d have been a lot more impressed if the production company involved had donated their fee to Stand Up To Cancer, and if the vast number of techies had also been working for free, but there we are.Paul Hollywood said with surprise that my lemon drizzle cake tasted good, and Prue Leith took some of it home with her.A career as a pastry chef does not beckon. From now on, I shall stick to eating things baked by others. I can manage that easily.The Great Celebrity Bake Off ... for Stand Up To Cancer is on Channel Four on Tuesdays at 8pm.

Nor should Bond be an Oriental or Asian actor – the same way a Caucasian actor should never be considered to play Shaka Zulu, Jawaharlal Nehru or Genghis Khan.’          Daniel Craig is due to play the secret agent in the 25th James Bond movie with the working title of Shatterhand          Idris Elbra has been hotly-tipped to take over the role from Daniel Craig and become the first black James Bond          James Bond was conceived by Ian Fleming as an Eton College pupil and has only been played by white men in the film franchise, such as Sean Connery in Goldfinger          Roger Moore, who played James Bond in seven films, says the character must be a straight white man because that is what Ian Fleming wroteIn 2017, Bond producer Barbara Broccoli responded to questions about whether Bond could be black or a woman by saying: ‘These films tend to reflect the times, so we always try to push the envelope a little bit. Anything is possible. Right now, it’s Daniel Craig and I’m very happy with Daniel Craig but who knows what the future will bring?’However, former Bond Sir Roger Moore said in 2015: ‘I have heard people talk about how there should be a lady Bond or a gay Bond. But they wouldn’t be Bond for the simple reason that wasn’t what Ian Fleming wrote. It is not about being homophobic or racist – it is simply about being true to the character.’In recent years, Luther star Idris Elba has been tipped as Bond. But in 2017, Anthony Horowitz, who wrote the 007 adventure Trigger Mortis, provoked a storm by dismissing the star as ‘too street’ to be Bond.Last week, Fiennes also revealed he had once been considered for the Bond role himself, saying: ‘There was a discussion, some years ago, about my playing 007. I don’t think I would have been very good, but I did feel that I could have had a crack at it.’Fleming originally created the spy in the likeness of white singer and actor Hoagy Carmichael."},{"url":null,"title":"Electric car charging points set Windsor Castle","story":"    A planning application has been submitted to install two electric car charging points at Windsor Castle, picturedYou can shove your medals!

Deputy ERG chair Steve Baker (seen in High Wycombe on June 19 last year, is also \u0027under great strain\u0027 and could be \u0027in play\u0027, a colleague said Former Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott, writing in the same paper, called Mrs May\u0027s deal \u0027far from perfect\u0027, but added: \u0027I would rather opt for the risk of a customs union later - a risk that has diminished in recent weeks - than the very real risk of a permanent customs union now. The choice isn\u0027t enviable, but the safer option is clear.\u0027Meanwhile, talks continued with the DUP, but the party stressed that the presence of Chancellor Philip Hammond at a meeting on Friday did not mean that money was being demanded.\u0027We are in discussions with the Government to ensure Northern Ireland is not separated out from the rest of the United Kingdom as we leave the European Union,\u0027 a spokesman said.\u0027Contrary to some reports we are not discussing cash. There are still issues to be addressed in our discussions.\u0027It comes as Liam Fox said Mrs May might not hold another vote on her Brexit deal this week if she is on course to another defeat. The International Trade Secretary told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u0027That would be determined by whether we can succeed in getting that vote through the House of Commons.\u0027He said it would be \u0027difficult to justify having a vote if you knew we were going to lose it\u0027.He added: \u0027I would say to my colleagues: all actions have consequences, and if you really want to deliver the Brexit we all promised... if we actually want to do that then we need to back the Prime Minister\u0027s deal because there is no other deal on offer.\u0027 DUP demands seat at the table in future EU trade talks as price for backing May\u0027s dealPolitics.

A short scuffle ensued before the boy was slammed to the ground by other members of the public          Attendees of the event held the young man and put him in a chokehold after the physical altercation          Mr Anning has been slammed by politicians for his extremist stance, as Australians pay their respects to the victims of terrorist attack (pictured: man who egged Anning)The right-wing politician was slammed by his peers for his extremist stance, while other Australians paid their respects to the victims of terrorist attack. Video footage from Saturday\u0027s event shows the young man approach Anning from behind, as he speaks in front of a camera.The man, who films the altercation, then slams an egg on to the back of the Senator\u0027s head who then spins his body to take aim at the youngster.A short scuffle ensued before the man was tackled to the ground by other members of the public.An image from the event shows the man walked from the venue by police.The 17-year-old was arrested but has since been released pending further inquiries. A video has emerged of men believed to be  right-wing cronies filming themselves apparently choking the man who threw the egg.The footage films the man\u0027s face up-close as he\u0027s appeared to be held down by the neck. The men can then be heard hurling abuse at him.\u0027You are nothing but a weak human being you p****,\u0027 one man can be heard saying.          Anning has sparked outrage after blaming immigration for the mosque shootings in New Zealand\u0027The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.\u0027Let us be clear, while Muslims may have been the victims today, usually they are the perpetrators. World-wide, Muslims are killing people in the name of their faith on an industrial scale.\u0027The entire religion of Islam is simply the violent ideology of a sixth century despot masquerading as a religious leader, which justifies endless war against anyone who opposes it and calls for the murder of unbelievers and apostates.\u0027The truth is that Islam is not like any other faith. It is the religious equivalent of fascism. And just because the followers of this savage belief were not the killers in this instance, does not make them blameless.\u0027As we read in Matthew 26:52, \u0027all they that take the sword, shall perish by the sword\u0027 and those who follow a violent religion that calls on them to murder us, cannot be too surprised when someone takes them at their word and responds in kind,\u0027 Senator Anning concluded.                                                    While another concerned member of the group appears to tell his friends to \u0027let him go\u0027.A Change.org petition calling for Mr Anning to be removed from parliament was released stating: \u0027Senator Fraser Anning has no place in the government of our democratic and multicultural country.\u0027We request that he be expelled from his position as Senator, and investigated by law enforcement agencies for supporting right wing terrorism. \u0027We call on the Australian government to expel this man who blames victims for their own violent deaths, and uses references to genocide to further his hateful agenda,\u0027 the petition says.\u0027There is no place in Australian government for Neo-Nazis. There is no place for bigotry. There is no place for hate speech.\u0027  Politicians have roundly condemned Mr Anning for his comments. Prime Minister Scott Morrison also hit out at the independent senator\u0027s comments in a tweet on Friday.\u0027The remarks by Senator Fraser Anning blaming the murderous attacks by a violent, right-wing, extremist terrorist in New Zealand on immigration are disgusting. These views have no place in Australia, let alone in the Australian Parliament.\u0027Labor frontbencher Tony Burke told the ABC \u0027the normalisation of bigotry is something that is not only confined to him\u0027. \u0027We need to call it out, we need to make sure that no way any member of parliament fosters it. He wants the conflict and he wants the notoriety,\u0027 he said on Saturday.\u0027He was put there as the result of being on the One Nation ticket. One Nation is the reason he is there.\u0027Opposition leader Bill Shorten also voiced his anger at Anning\u0027s comments.\u0027While families in Christchurch mourn for loved ones they\u0027ve lost, an obscure Australian senator saw this act of terrorism and tragedy as an opportunity to blame the murder victims,\u0027 he tweeted. "},{"url":null,"title":"Hair throne Charles begins 12 day tour Caribbean bit do","story":"    Hair to the throne!

After hearing about the mass litter pick in Britain, he told an international environmental gathering in Kenya that cleaning up towns, cities, beaches and the countryside was vital in raising awareness of waste disposal.Mr Kiisler said: ‘They see that their friend, neighbour or colleague from work or member of their family went out and, with their own bare hands, picked up some trash – because there is no other way to collect it. If they see their friends doing it, they will probably think twice before dropping litter again.’Some high street giants have also lent their support, including Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Greggs, McDonald’s, Costa Coffee and John Lewis.The Daily Mail has long campaigned against the scourge of plastic in the environment, putting pressure on politicians and businesses which led to the tax on single-use plastic bags and the ban on microbeads in cosmetics.The Great British Spring Clean will run between March 22 and April 23.

Tens of thousands of dishevelled women, children and men have streamed out of a small pocket in the village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border in recent weeks - and they still keep comingHe cautioned, however, that the SDF has not been able to verify that figure.Those fleeing the pocket have previously reported widely inconsistent figures on the number of people still inside, ranging from thousands to a few hundred. The SDF spokesman said there was no clear timeline for the end of the operation, estimating that it may take several more days at least before IS is driven from its last pocket.

Next time you whip out your swanky smartphone for a selfie or to photograph your lunch spare a thought for the Offaly-born and splendidly named John Joly. You might not recognise his name but he was one of the most brilliant scientists of his – or any – generation and helped bring the colour photograph to life. In 1894 he devised a system of photography which used plates marked with narrow lines in three colours to allow photographers develop colour images from a single photographic plate using what became know as the “Joly Method”. It would be remiss to leave you with the impression that is all Joly did when it was very much a by-the-way thing. The Trinity graduate was a geologist, physicist and engineer as well as being an inventor. He was the Chair of Geology and Mineralogy in Trinity College from 1897 until his death in 1933 and also played a key role in the development of radiotherapy as a cancer treatment and came up with techniques to accurately estimate the age of a geological period using the radioactive elements in minerals.

Photograph: Getty ImagesFewer girls than boys are choosing to study Stem subjects in college due to the choices they make at Leaving Cert level, new research has shown.The Understanding Gender Differences in STEM study, published by the UCD centre for economic research, reveals that the subjects female students choose to study during the Leaving Cert cycle strongly influence whether or not they will go on to study courses in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) at third level.Even two years before college entry, students are making decisions that impact whether or not they go on to study Stem, said the authors of the report.They are calling on the Government to intervene at an earlier stage in encouraging women to pursue careers in engineering and technology.The research was carried out using data from the Central Admissions Office (CAO) and included all students aged 16-20 who did their Leaving Cert and applied for degree courses between 2015 and 207.At Leaving Cert level, boys were found to be three times more likely to study physics and applied maths, while girls were more likely to study chemistry and biology.Less than 5 per cent of girls studied more practical subjects such as engineering, building construction, design graphics and technology. These ides also existed across mixed-gender schools, suggesting that the availability of certain subjects does not play a strong role in whether or not students study Stem at college.The study warns of a significant gender difference in CAO applications for Stem courses at third level, with more than 40 per cent of boys applying for Stem courses compared to about 19 per cent of girls.Large gapThis large gap appears to be driven by boys opting for engineering and technology, with girls slightly more likely to choose science and mathematics.While there was no gap found in science, the report notes a “substantial” gender gap in engineering and technology courses at third level. It found that students’ overall academic achievement at Leaving Cert played a “negligible role” in whether or not they go on to study Stem subjects.Gender gaps were found to be smaller among high-achieving students and for students who go to school in more affluent areas.The report notes that while subject choices explain most of the gender gap in engineering, they do not explain the gender gap in technology, “suggesting different policies may be required to tackle the gender gap in technology than in engineering”.The gender gap becomes much smaller once nursing is included as one of the Stem subjects.Women were more than twice as likely than men to list courses in education on their CAO forms, and more than four times as likely to list healthwelfare courses.In order to reduce the Stem gender gap at third level, the study recommends that interventions are made when students are choosing their Leaving Cert subjects rather than two years later when they are deciding what to study at college.A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said the promotion of increased participation of all students, with a particular focus on female students, in Stem subjects was a “key priority”.Third-level entrantsShe underlined that the number of female third-level entrants studying engineering, manufacturing and construction rose by 4 per cent between 2016-2018.A recent report from the department also found the gender gap at third level was “heavily influenced” by subject choices, and as a result a review of career guidance will shortly be submitted.“The purpose of the review is to ensure that we are providing high quality, relevant career guidance information to students from post-primary level up to further and higher education,” said the spokeswoman.She said the department was also “scoping out potential means” of improving the range of Stem subjects offered by post-primary schools and planning to undertake research on the key influencers on subject and career choice."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3829293.1552835684!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"refusal of permission for new galway hospice devastating","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGalway Hospice inpatient Michele Coghlan: Decision to refuse permission for new facility is ‘just not right’Located on the Dublin Road at Renmore, the current Galway Hospice facility is not fit for purpose and the search for a new site began in 2010. Of the dozens of sites identified and examined, Merlin Park was deemed most suitable and hospice representatives, together with design teams, met Galway City Council planners on numerous occasions before finalising the design.“Our initial plans were a much bigger scale and footprint but when we started speaking with councillors, some objections came to light. Initially we had asked for 14 acres to be rezoned, we reduced that to seven and went from a single-storey to a two-storey, while being careful to minimise the compromise and impact on patients and families,” said hospice chief executive Mary Nash.AppealedWhen the plans were submitted, the council received 19 submissions from An Taisce, environmental bodies and local residents. The council granted planning permission, subject to a number of conditions.The council’s decision was appealed to An Bord Pleanála by three parties – An Taisce, Dr Claire Hillery and Friends of Merlin Woods. The grounds of appeal largely related to the preservation of habitats for various bird, animal and plant species.“One of our planning conditions was that we had to maintain the habitats and we were happy to do that because that was an asset for patients and visitors,” said Ms Nash.After an oral hearing last December, an An Bord Pleanála inspector recommended the council’s decision be upheld, subject to conditions. On January 25th, An Bord Pleanála overturned this recommendation, saying the development would be “inappropriate and contrary to policies to protect natural heritage”.Galway Hospice is now considering its position. “The only option is a judicial review but that must be on a point of law. We’re seeking advice at present,” said Ms Nash.Michele Coghlan’s first experience with Galway Hospice was in 2016 after she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a rare form of cancer.ChemotherapyMs Coghlan (64) underwent several bouts of chemotherapy and had a successful stem cell transplant in April 2017. The following December, with her cancer in remission, she had a stroke. “I was out driving one day when I had a stroke and I’ve been paralysed down my left side since then.”In August 2018, her cancer relapsed. “A stroke and cancer are the two biggest illnesses a person can get in their life and I’m fighting both.”Currently an in-patient, she credits Galway Hospice with her positive outlook. “The service they provide here is incredible. Cancer is one of the loneliest journeys you’ll ever make. That step to dying is yours you’re on your own. But the positivity here is great. You really don’t feel like you’re sick here. Galway Hospice is like a haven of tranquillity, peace, care and love,” she said.She said she was devastated at the decision to refuse permission for the new facility.“The demand for hospice services in Galway is increasing all the time and these are useless interruptions – it’s just not right.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"The family of Ireland\u0026rsquos bronze medallist Lucy Dollard say the big occasion didn\u0026rsquot faze herInitiative comes after campaign aimed at women led to reversal in declining salesMarymount letter to Minister for Health blames pay restoration and seeks extra fundsGalway Hospice seeking advice after An Bord Plean\u0026aacutela objects to developmentFigures show 26 prisoners and nine officers contracted contagious disease over 10 yearsFF and FG figures see no case for holding by-elections ahead of general electionDoora Barefield Community Games to eliminate plastic waste with reusable logo bottleRapid response emergency operation in action at Greenvale Hotel, Cookstown, Co TyroneAgainst claims of abuse of public-private ratios, report says doctors not at faultBreaching of rules on fee-paying patients beyond doctors\u0026rsquo control, HSE report saysBriefing notes prepared for Taoiseach\u0026rsquos meeting with the American Chamber show the scheme cost the State \u0026euro18.1m in 2016Man in his 60s pronounced dead at scene near Kilbeggan, Co WestmeathT\u0026aacutenaiste hints May must signal she will reach out to opposition if she wants EU approvalThousands throng streets of capital in dizzying array of green-themed attireGarda\u0026iacute say nothing to suggest anything suspicious about fireTwo men in their 70s and 80s breached security in effort to reach aircraftRyan steered fiscal policy during turbulent period in State\u0026rsquos economic historyWorld champion boxer raising funds for neighbouring family who lost their home"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3829641.1552852969!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"st patrick s day in chicago no place for chlorophobic unionists","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Chicago River as it winds its way through downtown after being dyed green. Photograph: Scott OlsonGetty ImagesIf you suffer from chlorophobia (fear of the colour green), downtown Chicago is not the place to be around St Patrick’s Day. But if you happen to be a chlorophobic unionist, it must be a nightmare.The worst part is the mysterious powder with which the locals famously dye the river every year. It starts out orange, of all colours, before being miraculously transformed on contact with the water. Then, before you can say “Mary Lou McDonald”, the orange turns to a green so intense, especially when the sun shines on it, it’s like the 40 shades combined.Not even the most devout Catholic nationalists in Chicago would claim the river contains holy water. But the formula for the dye, said to be vegetable-based, environmentally friendly, and of a kind once used by plumbers for detecting leaks, is the closely kept secret of two local families, the Rowans and the Butlers, who have been performing this sacrament for more than half a century.So it retains an air of mystery, even though the process is itself an annual spectacle. Three hours before the St Patrick’s parade, two boats take to the river, the first crew distributing “40 pounds” of the magic powder, the second mixing it. It takes a while to achieve the perfect consistency. But the boat crews know their trade, and by the time the marchers pass, the effect is at its height.Toxic substanceBack at the start of the parade this year, meanwhile, there was another colour change – subtle but noticeable – going on. It affected the demeanour of the official Irish delegation, who were left red-faced by the unforeseen addition of a toxic substance called “Conor McGregor” to the guests of honour.McGregor absorbs attention in the US like the Chicago river absorbs powder, so the official VIP Leo Varadkar was badly upstaged. The box-office mismatch aside, the Taoiseach was also forced into uncomfortably proximity with a man who seems ever-more intent on justifying the nickname “Notorious”.At one point, only the Chicago mayor, Rahm Emanuel (who may have had some explaining to do), separated his two guests. Thereafter, the number of buffers grew to something more comfortable.Varadkar was diplomatic about the encounter afterwards. Asked how he felt about McGregor representing Ireland in the parade, he showed deft footwork, worthy of the fighter himself. McGregor was not representing Ireland, he said: “That’s kind of what I was doing.”He was back on safer ground by then, or rather water, as guest of a river boat tour hosted by Tourism Ireland. Having launched the boat, they also launched a book called Ireland’s Greening of the World, marking 10 years of the ingenious national marketing campaign by which multiple global landmarks are colonised by coloured lighting every March 17th, at very little cost.This year the list included everything from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to Dubai’s Burj al Arab. But the piece de resistance, arguably, was the stuff by now under Varadkar, and all around him.Picture yourself in a boat on a river, rendered bright green by a tangerine dye. The effect was psychedelic. With the sun glinting on the water, and off the surrounding skyscrapers (including the local Trump Tower), it was like an Irish-themed LSD trip: Leo in the Sky with Diamonds.An Irish weddingAn experience of a rather earthier kind had awaited the Taoiseach when he was chief guest at the annual Irish Fellowship of Chicago dinner the night before. His speech included a joke about the belated official pardon for Mrs O’Leary’s Cow, long blamed for starting the great fire of Chicago, which Varadkar then developed into a serious point about the scapegoating of immigrants generally.But it was not an occasion for subtlety. Speakers had to shout to be heard by the huge, raucous gathering. Only the priest who gave the pre-dinner invocation was heard in silence. Otherwise it was like the advanced stages of a very large Irish wedding, or wake. Or both. The Taoiseach would have needed a loudhailer to be heard.Long-time observers thought the occasion more suited to the oratorical talents of Michael Ring, who was also part of the visiting delegation. He was not among the speech-makers, but he was certainly in his element. Noting the high numbers of Mayo emigrants present, and in Chicago generally, he was even thinking of a late career change. “If I ran for mayor here, I’d be elected,” he told us afterwards. We had no trouble believing it."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3829704.1552858449!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"general election in prospect this year as tds set to run for europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBilly Kelleher: suffered a shock defeat in a Fianna Fáil selection convention. Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThe chance of a general election by the end of the year have increased because at least four sitting TDs will contest the European elections, despite the shock defeat of Billy Kelleher in a Fianna Fáil selection convention.As of this weekend, three sitting deputies – Fine Gael’s Frances Fitzgerald and Andrew Doyle, and Brendan Smyth of Fianna Fáil – have been selected as candidates for the elections in May.There is also speculation that Wexford TD Mick Wallace could also decide to run in South.The situation means that at least three by-elections would need to be held within six months if the candidates are successful.Senior figures in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have said they see no case for holding by-elections ahead of a general election, meaning there would likely be a national poll during the 2019 calendar year.Mr Kelleher was the clear favourite to win the Fianna Fáil nomination for the South constituency on Saturday but was beaten by eight votes in a very tight contest by Wexford councillor Malcolm Byrne.Despite his loss, the Cork South Central TD is a certainty to be a party candidate, Fianna Fáil sources said. It is expected he will be be added to the ticket by the party’s national constituency commission. Fianna Fáil will need to run two candidates in the five-seat constituency, which s a large geographical area from Wicklow to Cork.Low turnoutFianna Fáil’s South convention was held in Clonmel on Saturday, where only 900 of the 8,400 eligible delegates cast their vote. In the end, Mr Byrne won by eight votes. There was criticism that the location and the day chosen, just before St Patrick’s Day, meant the turnout was particularly low and not representative.Yesterday, Mr Kelleher would not be drawn into any criticism of the convention. He said he was disappointed by the result and his candidacy will now depend on what is decided by the national constituency commission. “When you go into a contest you hope you can win. It was not the case and I wish all the best to Malcolm Byrne,” he said.Mr Byrne, a member of Wexford County Council since 2009, said he was “honoured” to be selected. He said with the crisis around Brexit, it was important to have “sensible and responsible Fianna Fáil politics in the European Parliament”.Following a High Court challenge taken by Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty in 2010 over long delays in holding a by-election in Donegal, the laws were changed. By-elections must now take place within six months of a Dáil seat being vacated.Brexit factorWith MEPs due to take up their seats in the EU parliament in early July, any by-elections must be held by early January 2020 at the latest.Among senior TDs and officials in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil contacted this weekend, an overwhelming majority were of the view that a general election would take place before the by-elections would be held.In addition, with the Brexit process either near completion or about to be subject to a long delay, the reasons against holding an election during 2019 have become less potent.Several sources said it would not be in either party’s interest to have by-elections quickly followed by a general election. Some pointed to the experience of 2010, when Mr Doherty’s landslide victory in the Donegal by-election created huge momentum behind Sinn Féin just ahead of the 2011 general election.“I just can’t see the Government agreeing to hold three by-elections, none of which Fine Gael would do well in, and then announce a general election several weeks later,” said a senior Fine Gael TD."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3829663.1552855121!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit no vote on deal this week without dup and erg support","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, with fellow MP Emma Little-Pengelly, after speaking to the media outside the Cabinet Office. Photograph: Henry NichollsReutersTheresa May will not put her Brexit deal to a vote at Westminster this week unless the DUP and hard-line Conservative Brexiteers agree to support it, two of her top ministers have warned.Chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond and international trade secretary Liam Fox said there would be no point in bringing the deal back for a third vote unless the government was confident of winning.“We’re not just going to keep presenting it if we haven’t moved the dial. But what’s happened since last Tuesday is that a significant number of colleagues, including some very prominent ones who’ve gone public, have changed their view on this and decided that the alternatives are so unpalatable to them that they, on reflection, think that the prime minister’s deal is the best way to deliver Brexit,” Mr Hammond told the BBC.MPs voted last week to delay Brexit by three months if the House of Commons approves the deal by Wednesday. But Mrs May warned that failure to endorse the deal this week could lead to a much longer delay of anything between nine and 21 months.Talks between the DUP and the UK government are expected to continue on Monday following lengthy meetings during the past few days.The DUP is seeking legal assurances about the temporary nature of the Northern Irish backstop and guarantees from London that regulations in the North will not be allowed to erge further from the rest of the UK without the approval of the Stormont institutions.The party has insisted that it is not talking about “cash” but Mr Hammond declined three times to rule out extra money for Northern Ireland if the DUP backs the deal.“This isn’t about money. It’s about a political assurance,” he said. “We are coming up to a spending review and we will have to look at all budgets, including devolved block-grant budgets.“We hope that once we’ve got Brexit dealt with, we will be able to resume the powersharing executive in Northern Ireland, and then of course we will need to look at the spending review.”Labour stanceJeremy Corbyn said on Sunday that Labour would support an amendment that would approve Mrs May’s Brexit deal on condition that it could not be implemented without being endorsed in a confirmatory referendum. But he suggested that if the amendment passed, Labour would still vote against the Brexit deal itself in the main motion.“We’re not supporting Theresa May’s deal at all, because we think it’s a blindfold Brexit, which would do enormous damage to our economy,” he told Sky News.In Brussels on Sunday, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that if the UK were to seek a lengthy extension, it should be accompanied by a re-evaluation by London of its Brexit approach.Speaking in Chicago at the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he would be meeting European Council president Donald Tusk in Dublin on Tuesday, followed by a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.“At the Cabinet meeting, we will be in a position to sign off on a package of support for business, for farmers, for the agri-food sector, for exporters, for anyone who may be adversely affected by a no-deal Brexit,” he said. “Obviously we are hoping that the deal will be ratified by the House of Commons before then, but if it is not, we are ready.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Beto loves Joseph Campbell and Star Wars, which was inspired by Campbell’s work.The last One, about the same age when he jumped into national politics precociously aiming to usurp his elders, was also a uniter who went on an odyssey of self-discovery in New York while at Columbia.The last One also sold a cult of personality, offered himself as a symbol of modernity, sparked Oprah’s interest and had a preoccupation with being cool.Indeed, Obama told David Axelrod recently on The Axe Files that Beto reminded him of himself.The One anointing the New One. Joe Biden, pushed aside by Obama in the last election, was understandably irritated.Just as reporters once swooned when Obama made like Jay-Z and brushed imaginary dirt off his shoulder after a tough primary debate in Philly in 2008, reporters were entranced when O’Rourke air-drummed Baba O’Riley by The Who at a Whataburger drive-through after his debate with Cruz.To many, Beto’s appeal is his persona as a quasi-rebellious 1990s suburban teenager, a skateboarding punk rocker who seems to have modelled his campaign logo on the spicy ketchup logo at Whataburger.But others are less charmed. A satirical video on Twitter by skaters mocked “bad-skater Beto” as the kind of middle-school poser who “went to Zumiez and spent $27 on stickers”.‘Psychedelic Warlord’In a new Reuters story, Joseph Menn reveals that while O’Rourke was still a teenager, he was a member of the Cult of the Dead Cow, a stealthy hacking group named after an old Texas slaughterhouse. A kind of Neo-lite, he used the handle “Psychedelic Warlord” looking for free video games. (Socialist alert!)A hacker might be refreshing after a president who refers to Tim Cook as Tim Apple. Still, Menn writes, “it’s unclear whether the United States is ready for a presidential contender who, as a teenager, stole long-distance phone service for his dial-up modem, wrote a murder fantasy in which the narrator drives over children on the street, and mused about a society without money”.The 15th entry in the Democratic race is at the nexus of many tricky issues for a party desperate to oust Inidual 1 from the White House.Is it better to nominate a celebrity like Obama with a slight record that cannot be targeted or someone with established credentials? Should the nominee spring from the far left, the vector brimming with electricity and fight, or is that suicidal in a national election?Can white men jump in, or is this post-#MeToo era the time when Democratic and independent women will demand a woman at the top of the ticket? Will Democratic voters longing for another Obama and the minority voters who strayed from Hillary want an African-American?Can pugilistic progressives stomach a rich kid like Beto at a time when the country is in an eat-the-rich mood? Will they tolerate candidates like Beto and Biden, who speak well of Republicans and have a history of working with them?As the Wall Street Journal reports, O’Rourke tried to please Texas Republican business leaders when he “opposed Obamacare, voted against Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader and called for a raise in the social security eligibility age”.The fever is running high in his party. Will Beto turn out to be born for it or borne away by it?"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 16 march 2019","story":"HMS Argyll returns home to Devonport, England.

I really like maths.The number is used in engineering, physics, supercomputing and space exploration - because its value can be used in calculations for waves, circles and cylinders.According to the Pi World Ranking List website, which names Indian Suresh Kumar Sharma as the person to recite the most digits of pi at 70,030 in 2015, Charley places 451st in the world.Charley\u0027s headmaster, Adrian Palmer, said: This is an incredible achievement and one that no Wycliffe pupil has done before.  Charley received a standing ovation for his efforts in assembly and it was so richly deserved.Earlier this week, Google employee Emma Haruka Iwao broke the Guinness World Record for calculating pi to the most number of digits.  Her calculation to 31.4 trillion decimal places broke the previous record by nearly nine trillion digits.Jacinda Ardern to announce gun law reforms within 10 days after suspect bought arsenal onlineCookstown incident: Two people die and one critically ill amid \u0026#39crush\u0026#39 at St Patrick\u0026#39s Day party in Northern IrelandWorld\u0026#39s oldest ship\u0026#39s bell and astrolabe discovered in 516-year-old Portuguese wreck off OmanNHS accepting money from milk formula industry \u0026#39risks babies\u0026#39 health\u0026#39Two dead as US Midwest battered by heavy stormsBaptiste, episode 5, review: this stifling Nordic noir remains enjoyably slipperyDonald Trump \u0026#39ready to leave nearly 1,000 troops in Syria\u0026#39Boris Johnson urges May to make final appeal on backstop in blow to PM\u0026#39s hopes of getting Brexit deal throughSenior SNP rebels urge Tory Brexiteers to back Theresa May\u0026#39s dealBaptiste, episode 5 recap: the confessions and body count pile up – but how deep does the corruption go?Comment: To back the PM\u0026#39s deal, we need proof that the next stage of Brexit talks will be radically differentGamblers face tough new ID and age checks in move to create national \u0026#39self-exclusion\u0026#39 scheme for addictsSkeletons of the Mary Rose: the New Evidence, review - hardly revelatory, but a more accurate picture of our pastSocial media firms should not be held fully responsible for how their users behave, says SnapchatSurrey teenager stabbed in \u0026#39far-Right terror attack\u0026#39 amid spate of racist incidents after New Zealand massacreTheresa May should make a \u0026#39dignified departure,\u0026#39 says former Cabinet ministerFireman Sam is putting women off joining the fire service because \u0026#39most of the job is nothing like it is portrayed\u0026#39Dragons\u0026#39 Den investments perform worse than normal start-ups, research showsShamima Begum\u0026#39s lawyer visits Syrian refugee camp where she is living, but is barred from meeting her by guardsBiodegradable coffee cups being \u0026#39grown\u0026#39 in bid to cut down on plastic wasteNHS screening units should be set up near offices and shops so workers can have checks for breast and bowel cancer in their lunch breaksWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dispatch taking long crush isils last stronghold baghuz","story":"Viewed from above, Isil’s last stronghold looks for cross between a scrapyard and a nightmarish parody of the Glastonbury festival.  From the Syrian Democratic Force’s (SDF) observation post on the cliff-top overlooking the town of Baghuz from the south, hundreds of vehicles can be seen jumbled together in a dense sea of tents, buildings, and jerry-rigged infrastructure.  We were not allowed to stay long: the position has been regularly targeted by Isil snipers and wire-guided missiles fired from the camp below.But this commanding height is the best - maybe the only place - from which to understand this arduous and increasingly puzzling battle.To the left, the broad meander of the Euphrates...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

Despite the humiliating rejection of Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal, Britain is no closer to knowing the end result of its vote to leave the European Union. A raft of amendments to be voted on by MPs on Tuesday threaten to further muddy the waters as the clock ticks down to Britain\u0027s scheduled departure from the EU on March 29Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney being interviewed by host Andrew Marr on the BBC1 current affairs programme, Simon Coveney told the Show that the EU would not ratify a Brexit deal without a backstop.He is to\u0026nbspcall on the government and\u0026nbspregulators to act “with urgency” to change these rules, which he says public service broadcasters at a disadvantage.“The current regulatory system has its origins in an era where the BBC was seen as the big beast in the jungle, the big beast against whom all others needed protection,” Sir David will add.BBC and ITV announce new streaming service BritBox“But that view of the world has now passed. Increasingly, our major competitors are well funded, international giants – Netflix, Spotify, Facebook, YouTube – whose financial resources dwarf our own.”Earlier this month Channel 4 chief executive Alex Mahon called for action to make public service broadcasters easy to find for viewers.She said the rise of smart TV interfaces, streaming sticks and other ways of watching TV meant “we are sleepwalking into a position where public service content is no longer prominent”.Netflix says it has 139 million paid memberships in over 190 countries but does not release viewing figures for its programs. The BBC says that 3.6 billion programmes were requested on iPlayer overall in 2018.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

But stepping away from Jo Malone, the company she created at her kitchen table, proved harder than she thought.The Estée Lauder deal included a “lockout clause”, which meant she was contractually prevented from being\u0026nbsppart of the beauty industry and forced into a five-year exile. Such was\u0026nbspher influence, this meant she wasn’t even allowed to purchase items from a beauty counter in case it appeared to be an endorsement.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.“I missed the industry so much. Believe it or not, it never really felt like a business to me. When I’m creating and working I literally come alive, it’s something that’s in me,” she tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.This might be why those\u0026nbspclose to her\u0026nbspwere not surprised when she told them about her idea to launch a second global fragrance brand.Nearly half of business people ‘miss family when travelling’“My family knew because I’ve been such a nightmare to live with for five years. They knew I had to get back there, it was inevitable.“But some of my friends did tell me: ‘I know you’ve got another business in you Jo but should it be fragrance again?’” she adds.Sometimes in business you know you’ve made a big mistake but you don’t have the money to put it right straight away, so you have to salvage as much as you can and that’s what I did“I still love Jo Malone, of course, even if I don’t identify with it creatively anymore. I’m still proud of it and Estée Lauder has done an incredible job. But Jo Loves doesn’t feel like a business, it’s an extension of who I am,” she says.Being a household name, you might assume building a start-up would have been easier the second time around, but Malone laughs out loud as soon as she hears the question: “I’ve got to be honest with you, the first two years were just excruciating.\u0026nbsp“Now I can say this because we have passed that stage, but I’m not sure I could have told you this at the time, I felt so embarrassed. I’m afraid – and I say this to all the people that are building their businesses today – if success does land on your doorstep on day one, you’re one in a million.”Espresso shot mochi ice cream balls unveiled at Selfridge’sAccording to Malone, she made every mistake possible, from packaging to distribution, when launching her new brand.\u0026nbsp“We were about to launch our capsule collection in Selfridges over Christmas, a fantastic opportunity. We were building the pop-up the night before opening day and I just knew I had made the biggest mistake with the packaging, it just wasn’t right.“Sometimes in business you know you’ve made\u0026nbspa big mistake but you don’t have the money to put it right straight away, so you have to salvage as much as you can, and that’s what I did in the first two years. What I knew was I had a product that could still be global and that’s what drove me.”“During these two years, I just kept thinking, I have to get through the week, the month, Christmas. The thing that motivated me the most were the people working with me and the salaries I was responsible for. At one point when there was not enough coming in, I started doing speaking engagements across the country. I knew these engagements would give me a fee that would guarantee a month’s\u0026nbspsalary.”At the time, Malone operated from a creative studio in west London. Customers from all over the world would have to call and make an appointment to order a candle or a fragrance, buying 10-15 bottles in bulk. She had a thriving little business, but she knew it needed a home.After an 18-month delay, which allowed her to replace the initial red packaging with a more subtle white, she launched with a single shop on Elizabeth Street in London’s Belgravia in 2013 – in the very same space where she started her shopkeeper journey more than 30 years ago.\u0026nbsp“Sometimes life will bring you back to where you started,” she says.Malone’s business philosophy comes from a continual desire to innovate and inspire, which is why her shop was always going to be different.\u0026nbsp“I didn’t want to do another candle store. So I thought of a new way to present everything. It’s about changing the way that the industry looks at cosmetics and fragrance,” she adds.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThe store itself is a delight to the senses the second you step into it. The elegant white design of the shop allows your eyes to relax and the door is always kept closed, enabling customers to be stimulated by the scents in the air – the perfect setting for Malone’s “Fragrance Brasserie Bar”, where customers can try out a complimentary fragrance “tapas” experience.\u0026nbspDuring the experience,\u0026nbspshoppers can start by selecting their desired fragrance to create a palate of scents – similar to a food tasting, but for the nose. Bath cologne is first warmed in a tagine before being presented to you as a cloud of steam\u0026nbspa cleanser is then shaken over ice and strained into a Martini glass. Lastly, lotion is whipped and foamed before being painted onto your skin.\u0026nbspSometimes when you’re on your own and you start your business from your spare room, it can be isolating. I want to inspire the next generation but also tell them that they’re not on on their own“In the same way we all remember our first kiss, I wanted my customers to remember their first experience with my brand. It adds value to the brand with no costs and translates into a sale 97 per cent of the time,” she says.For Malone, perfume is strongly associated with memories. Her bestseller scent Pomelo – a fresh, citrus smell with hints of rose and patchouli, reminiscent of a summer holiday – is now one of 14 fragrances inspired by her own experiences. Other products include bath and body lotions, and candles of course.In 2017, Malone started using a paintbrush as part of the brand’s fragrance tapas\u0026nbspexperience, which inspired her to change how her customers applied scent. Although very few believed in the idea originally, it’s now her flagship product.“Whenever someone says ‘no one is going to use that’\u0026nbspor ‘it’s never going to work’, it always goes into my head. These paintbrushes became my golden ticket, the product that got me all over the world telling creative stories. So, if someone tells you you can’t do it, stick to your guns. Don’t always listen to the voices around you.”Jo Loves was always designed to be a global brand and Malone is planning to open new stores soon, both in the UK and across the Atlantic –\u0026nbspalthough she doesn’t want to discuss the exact locations just yet.Jo Malone launches new collection with Poppy Delevingne“I can see the potential in my business and it’s something I would never take for granted,” she says.For any young entrepreneur starting their business, Malone’s story is an inspiration. Perhaps\u0026nbspbecause she was repeatedly told she would fail, she’s keen to give back to the next generation and tell them that they are not alone.With that in mind, Malone has recently taken part in Secret Leaders – a business podcast that es deep into the stories of top CEOs, their brands and their personal lives.“Sometimes when you’re on your own and you start your business from your spare room, it can be isolating. There’s a lot of self-doubt. I want to inspire the next generation, but also tell them that they’re not on on their own.”“So Secret Leaders is a way to share my story with them – the good the bad and the ugly. Sometimes hearing someone else’s story might inspire you to think differently.”Malone cites\u0026nbsppassion, resilience and respect for the currency of creativity as the three most important values in developing a new brand.\u0026nbspWhen I ask what advice she would give to a young business owner in doubt, she quotes the catchphrase from the movie The Imitation Game,\u0026nbspin which\u0026nbspBenedict Cumberbatch plays British mathematician Alan Turing: “Sometimes it’s the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.”\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

A street is marked “dark @ night” and another “hangout spot”. The groups are identifying what’s already available in neighbourhoods and what is desirable. It is part of the social action lab, a project with the British Council and the University of Central Lancashire to encourage Preston residents to become more active within their communities by offering them seed funding to develop projects.\u0026nbspThe social action lab, which brings together artists, community activists and residents, is exactly the kind of thing Ruth Heritage hoped to support in Preston when she opened the People’s Production Lab in November 2017. The next step is to turn the many businesses and artists\u0026nbspworking within the Lab into a cooperative, owned and run by the people who work there, to make it sustainable.\u0026nbspThe design secrets of the UK’s biggest cooperativeCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Preston has become a testing ground for a new way to run a local economy. The “Preston model” is rooted in the development of cooperatives, or businesses owned by workers, rather than shareholders in remote locations looking to extract value with stocks and idends.Cooperative startups have been shown to be more resilient during times of economic stress. While 44 per cent of new businesses survive their early years, 80 per cent of cooperatives go on to thrive, according to a 2018 report on the cooperative economy by Cooperatives UK.\u0026nbspPreston Council has just announced up to £1m in funding to support the development of cooperatives in the area. The funding will come from Preston City Council, the University of Central Lancashire and the Open Society Foundations, which was started by hedge fund billionaire George Soros. It will create 10 new cooperatives, owned and run by workers in Preston, building on the work of community businesses with ambitions to become cooperatives, like the People’s Production Lab and others.\u0026nbsp“We want to provide equitable employment for graduates in the first instance,” says Mark Porter, a senior lecturer in web design at the University of Central Lancashire who is starting a cooperative called Preston Digital Foundation.\u0026nbspMr Porter believes working at the People’s Production Lab will provide the basis for cooperation between cooperatives, one of the seven basic principles of working in this way. “Our next steps are to complete the registration process to get the coop up and running in time for summer and the next cohort of graduates and enable us to start generating revenue.”Heritage started producing and commissioning arts and culture in Preston a decade ago under the name They Eat Culture. She began to imagine a fully-equipped creative space for the people of Preston, where digital businesses and artists could share resources and work together. In 2017, Michael Conlon, the manager of a local construction firm, suggested Heritage take on the multi-storey building at 55 Guildhall Street in the town centre. The building, previously used as offices by Lancashire County Council, had been empty since the departure of a faith school.\u0026nbspWithin a year, Heritage and They Eat Culture have transformed the commercial building into creative spaces. Peering through the windows, I see white walls of former corporate spaces\u0026nbspfilled with equipment for a\u0026nbspwood shop and tool library, a co-working space with desks and chairs donated by a local solicitor, a hack space with 3D printers and a sound studio with a green screen for video work. Art hangs from a washing line from the ceiling of one of the offices\u0026nbsp– now a screen printing studio. In the hallway, Heritage gets inside a makeshift photo-booth that went on tour with accompanying interview cards saying “talk to me about crime” and “talk to me about loneliness”.“There are artists studios and shared spaces in Preston, but we’re trying to evolve a way of creating shared facilities that people can use rather than inidual spaces,” Heritage says.Anthony King runs a startup screen printing studio called Priestown Press from the People’s Production Lab. “I was out of work for quite a while after some surgery,” King says. “My wife suggested I get back into art. The Lab has allowed us to expand and have the space to be artists. It’s subsidised, so it’s beneficial for artists who are struggling. There aren’t that many in Preston.”Priestown Press prints garments for street artists in Preston and London. Through the social action lab, King has been working on turning the studio into a community resource and a place for art therapy.\u0026nbsp“It’s evolving into a social enterprise,” King says. “Especially for mental health, art can be very therapeutic. Suicide is on the rise among men and younger people, so if we can do projects that get kids doing things, rather than keeping themselves to themselves, then it can only help.”Tom Stables is the chair of Digital Lancashire, a non-profit organisation that supports the digital economy in Lancashire. Stables says the area is already home to multiple agencies, software houses and creative enterprises. Digital Lancashire has worked with accountants and TV companies, helping them develop their digital clientele and acquire funding to expand.\u0026nbspStables is considering basing Digital Lancashire within the People’s Production Lab where it can nurture partnerships with other businesses. “Having the People’s Production Lab on our doorstep is terrific,” he says. “As well as being a place that our board meet, a number of our members have the space to grow and thrive.”Heritage talks breathlessly of plans for live storytelling projects, comedy programmes developing new talent, a community culture guide and a vegan pop-up experience. “I want there to be a lot of action on the ground,” she says. “Preston has been held back by being off the beaten track and by not having relationships with central government but the tide is turning. The time is now.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Where new vehicles sold for use on British roads don’t conform to emissions standards, DVSA will work with other government agencies and manufacturers to ensure the vehicles are fixed as quickly as possible.”Concerns about vehicle emissions have grown since the Volkswagen diesel scandal emerged in September 2015.The German carmaker agreed to pay a €1bn (£880m) fine in Germany last year after it was revealed to have cheated tests on diesel engines in the US and Europe.In January, JLR announced it would cut 4,500 jobs to make £2.5bn of cost savings.

That is why a stodgy literary biopic like The Life of Emile Zola somehow won the main award at the 1937 Oscars. It’s a solid and worthy piece of work, with a grandstanding performance from Paul Muni (under a lot of whiskers) as the campaigning French novelist. The idea, though, that it is one of the “few truly great pictures of all time”, as its own publicity suggested, is clearly idiotic.It may seem churlish to go after an underdog like Rocky but this was an undeserving Best Picture winner. The Academy voters in 1976 acted as if they were punch drunk and had spent too long in the ring with Apollo Creed. The problem with its victory wasn’t so much the film itself but with the other nominees that were spurned in its favour. Taxi Driver, All the President’s Men and Network all surely had a better claim to that year’s statuette.310 8. Around the World in 80 DaysThis was a perfectly amiable big-budget travelogue but you can’t help but suspect its Best Picture Oscar was more to do with the marketing and hustling skills of its producer, Mike Todd, than with any brilliance in the filmmaking. It was directed by the Englishman Michael Anderson, previously best known for The Dam Busters, and featured David Niven as the intrepid traveller, Phileas Fogg, who bets he can travel all the way round the world in a little over two months.Paul Haggis’s Crash is a decent and well-meaning study of the consequences of racism and violence in contemporary LA. It was independently made and had a large ensemble cast, all giving heartfelt performances. However, Robert Altman had covered similar territory better in Short Cuts and the feeling persisted that it had won the Best Picture award because some Academy voters were determined not to give the Oscar to the gay-themed contemporary western Brokeback Mountain.You rarely win an Oscar without a strong marketing campaign. The now disgraced distributorproducer Harvey Weinstein knew the secrets of getting Academy voters on his side better than anyone else in the business. Whether it was the Blitz-like approach to advertising in the trade press, or the timing of the awards screenings, or the way he kept the film’s stars in front of the media or his relentless courtship of the Academy members, he was arguably as important to the Oscar success of the so-so musical Chicago as any of the creative talent behind it.It’s not bad. It’s a love story that touches on mental illness and mathematics (neither usually subjects that Hollywood embraces). Russell Crowe gives a fine performance as John Nash, the Nobel prize-winning boffin with the beautiful but unstable mind. Nonetheless, Ron Howard’s biopic isn’t any kind of classic. It won its Best Picture Oscar in an unusually thin year.Marty, the 1955 winner, isn’t even the best version of its own subject matter. This story, scripted by the great Paddy Chayevsky, about an emotionally repressed Italian American butcher from the Bronx looking for love, had already been made as a live TV drama the year before. In the small-screen version, Rod Steiger gave a superlative performance in the lead role. Ernest Borgnine in the film version can’t help but seem like second best to anyone who saw Steiger in the same part. Whereas the puggish Borgnine makes Marty a figure of pity, Steiger turned him into a full blown tragic hero.810 3. Out of AfricaYou’ll remember the pink flamingos and all those scenes of beautiful Kenyan landscapes that looked as if they were cribbed from a David Attenborough natural history documentary. You won’t ever forget Meryl Streep’s eccentric accent as the Danish baroness and author, Karen Blixen (“I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong hills”). This is mushy stuff, though, and hardly deserving of its Oscar.This rousing, Scottish-set (but partly Irish-filmed) medieval epic is famous for its scenes of William Wallace’s army in blue faces lifting their kilts and baring their bums. Regardless of how accurate this was as history, it played into ongoing debates about devolution and Scottish independence. The film also did its bit for the Scottish tourism business. Mel Gibson knows how to stage a battle scene. Whether that qualifies his film for a Best Picture Oscar is another matter.1010 1. The Greatest Show on EarthFrom a vantage point 67 years on, the decision to give the Best Picture Oscar to Cecil B DeMille’s circus epic in 1952 is truly baffling. British viewers who have seen it will almost certainly have done so on TV (where its 152-minute running time made it useful for filling in gaps in the schedule). It has a decent cast and some reasonable stunts but Academy voters were surely clowning around when they chose it over other nominees in the same year which have aged far, far better like High Noon and The Quiet Man.110 10.

Around the World in 80 DaysThis was a perfectly amiable big-budget travelogue but you can’t help but suspect its Best Picture Oscar was more to do with the marketing and hustling skills of its producer, Mike Todd, than with any brilliance in the filmmaking. It was directed by the Englishman Michael Anderson, previously best known for The Dam Busters, and featured David Niven as the intrepid traveller, Phileas Fogg, who bets he can travel all the way round the world in a little over two months.Paul Haggis’s Crash is a decent and well-meaning study of the consequences of racism and violence in contemporary LA. It was independently made and had a large ensemble cast, all giving heartfelt performances. However, Robert Altman had covered similar territory better in Short Cuts and the feeling persisted that it had won the Best Picture award because some Academy voters were determined not to give the Oscar to the gay-themed contemporary western Brokeback Mountain.You rarely win an Oscar without a strong marketing campaign. The now disgraced distributorproducer Harvey Weinstein knew the secrets of getting Academy voters on his side better than anyone else in the business. Whether it was the Blitz-like approach to advertising in the trade press, or the timing of the awards screenings, or the way he kept the film’s stars in front of the media or his relentless courtship of the Academy members, he was arguably as important to the Oscar success of the so-so musical Chicago as any of the creative talent behind it.It’s not bad. It’s a love story that touches on mental illness and mathematics (neither usually subjects that Hollywood embraces). Russell Crowe gives a fine performance as John Nash, the Nobel prize-winning boffin with the beautiful but unstable mind. Nonetheless, Ron Howard’s biopic isn’t any kind of classic. It won its Best Picture Oscar in an unusually thin year.Marty, the 1955 winner, isn’t even the best version of its own subject matter. This story, scripted by the great Paddy Chayevsky, about an emotionally repressed Italian American butcher from the Bronx looking for love, had already been made as a live TV drama the year before. In the small-screen version, Rod Steiger gave a superlative performance in the lead role. Ernest Borgnine in the film version can’t help but seem like second best to anyone who saw Steiger in the same part. Whereas the puggish Borgnine makes Marty a figure of pity, Steiger turned him into a full blown tragic hero.810 3. Out of AfricaYou’ll remember the pink flamingos and all those scenes of beautiful Kenyan landscapes that looked as if they were cribbed from a David Attenborough natural history documentary. You won’t ever forget Meryl Streep’s eccentric accent as the Danish baroness and author, Karen Blixen (“I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong hills”). This is mushy stuff, though, and hardly deserving of its Oscar.This rousing, Scottish-set (but partly Irish-filmed) medieval epic is famous for its scenes of William Wallace’s army in blue faces lifting their kilts and baring their bums. Regardless of how accurate this was as history, it played into ongoing debates about devolution and Scottish independence. The film also did its bit for the Scottish tourism business. Mel Gibson knows how to stage a battle scene. Whether that qualifies his film for a Best Picture Oscar is another matter.1010 1. The Greatest Show on EarthFrom a vantage point 67 years on, the decision to give the Best Picture Oscar to Cecil B DeMille’s circus epic in 1952 is truly baffling. British viewers who have seen it will almost certainly have done so on TV (where its 152-minute running time made it useful for filling in gaps in the schedule). It has a decent cast and some reasonable stunts but Academy voters were surely clowning around when they chose it over other nominees in the same year which have aged far, far better like High Noon and The Quiet Man.Tom Hanks played the role of Forrest, winning the Academy Award for the role, with the film also winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing.Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley ‘name newborn son after Forrest Gump’Ten films that define the 1990sDenis Villeneuve’s Dune reboot to be written by Forrest Gump scribeIn 2011, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\u0026nbspThere has been a recent trend of Bollywood remakes of American films, including 2017’s Chef, based on the Jon Favreau film, and 2014’s Bang!

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct.

Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable.

As the report makes clear, now is the time for the government to take action.”Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: “The overarching finding is the need for social media companies to have in place a duty of care to protect vulnerable users and the need for regulation which would provide much needed health and safety protection for what is a lawless digital playground.”Dr Bernadka Dubicka, chair of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said it agreed with the recommendations and called for more research into harms, funded by social media firms.She added: “We want to see the creation of a clear, statutory duty of care for social media companies and an external regulator to manage this.”Dr Max Davie, officer for health improvement for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “Social media has changed the social landscape and our children and young people are the test pilots.“Latest evidence suggests that screen time in itself is not harmful to child health but it’s when this displaces other important activities such as sleep, physical activity and face-to-face interaction that it can lead to harm.”The APPG report warned the “publicising of self-harm methods, in particular novel ones, as well as glamorisation of suicide” can lead to death.In February, following Ian Russell’s campaign after his daughter died, the head of Instagram said all graphic images of self-harm will be removed from the platform.We need more social media in schools – and I say this as a headteacherPrince Harry criticises social media for ‘distorting the truth’Social media companies face new laws on material fuelling stabbingsSocial media should be fined for ‘duty of care’ breaches, NSPCC says UK could ban social media companies over self-harm contentIn its evidence to the APPG, Facebook, which owns Instagram, also referenced a range of Instagram accounts that are “dedicated to specific mental health issues, as well as hashtags such as #edrecovery and #bodypositive”. Facebook said these “are used by our community to connect with one another, document their recovery and offer encouragement and support for others going through similar experiences”. Both Facebook and Twitter have been approached for comment.A government spokesperson said: “The government will soon publish a white paper which will set out the responsibilities of online platforms, how these responsibilities should be met and what would happen if they are not. An internet regulator, statutory ‘duty of care’ on platforms, and a levy on social media companies are all measures we are considering as part of our work.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

I remember the campaign well because it was the subject of an article I was producing for a university magazine, the first I ever wrote for any publication.The election was considered particularly\u0026nbspimportant because the Northern Irish prime minister, Terence O’Neill, was seeking endorsement of his policy of moving towards granting civil and political rights to the Catholic minority – a policy over which his own unionist party was split.I had a sense early on that it was already too late for compromise because institutionalised anti-Catholic discrimination had cut too deep for change to come without violence.There were signs of this in the villages and small towns around the lakes of Fermanagh. I was following the campaign of a Catholic candidate who held progressive opinions. One evening we saw a group of men standing beside the road and he made a short speech denouncing the unionist establishment. After he had finished, one of the men said that the candidate had no need to worry “because nobody here is going to vote for a Protestant”.Like many appeals to the moderate centre in Northern Ireland over the past half century, O’Neill’s did less well than many expected. The prime minister said he had received 150,000 letters supporting political compromise, but these failed to turn into enough votes on election day to give him the mandate he needed.Derry Girls has created a joyous and complex identity for N IrelandHe won only a slim majority among pro-reform unionist MPs and was humiliated when he almost lost his seat in Bannside to the virulently anti-Catholic preacher Ian Paisley, who was just gaining prominence in Northern Irish politics. O’Neill resigned as prime minister a few months later and Paisley went on to win the seat in the next election in 1970 as the candidate for the Protestant Unionist Party, which soon afterwards changed its name to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).Half a century later many things have changed in the world, from the fall of the Soviet Union to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that followed 911, but the DUP is very much the same today as it was then.The only (big) difference is that it is no longer a fringe party but one that provides the essential parliamentary support to keep the British government in power. Its views are eagerly and respectfully sought by politicians and media alike as to the terms under which Britain should leave the EU, seemingly ignoring that the DUP agenda is very different from that of the Conservative Party and other Brexit supporters.One of the many extraordinary things about Britain in the age of Brexit is that the nature and history of the DUP is not more closely examined. On the other hand, it is in keeping with a tradition in Britain of proud ignorance of Irish politics north and south as something not worth considering. This despite the fact that the fate of the Northern Irish backstop is a lead item in newscasts and at the centre of the most important decision in UK history since the Second World War. Tony Blair was one of the only British leaders to know much about Northern Ireland, which explains why he was able to negotiate the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) in 1998 that ended three decades of fighting. \u0026nbspPaisley mellowed in his last years, becoming first minister of the Northern Ireland Executive in 2007, but the DUP changed less than he did and remains closer to the uncompromising and sectarian views that he espoused for most of his career. Once he was asked about building bridges between the Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland and his reply explains much about the DUP’s approach today. “Where do bridges go?” he asked rhetorically and gave the classic response, damning in his eyes, that “they go over to the other side”.There is strong evidence that the DUP leader Arlene Foster, who opposed the GFA as a member of the Ulster Unionist Party before joining the DUP, still thinks along these lines. Asked in 2017 why she had not compromised with Sinn Fein, the dominant Catholic and nationalist party and her partner in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive, she replied: “If you feed a crocodile it will keep coming back and looking for more.”She later expressed regret for the crocodile comparison but her record in office appeared to back up her words in the eyes of Catholics, who now make up half the 1.9 million population of Northern Ireland.DUP tells May not to ‘roll over’ to the EU in fresh warningLater the same year, Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in the general election and reached a confidence and supply agreement with the DUP. This came with a £1bn subsidy for Northern Ireland in addition to the usual UK annual grant of £11bn a year.It was an extraordinary piece of luck for the DUP, though perhaps less lucky for the UK as whole, that the party should hold the balance of power at such a critical moment, though its beliefs had changed little since the first years of the Troubles.Dr John Kyle, a councillor for the Progressive Unionist Party on Belfast City Council and GP in the Protestant heartland of east Belfast, has had a close-up view of the DUP in action over many decades.He says: “The DUP remains socially conservative, politically right wing, strongly sectarian, very pragmatic, tough negotiators and always reluctant to change.” He adds that the central ground in Northern Irish politics remains sparsely inhabited because of the polarisation which has been exacerbated by Brexit.The DUP is much more like the Republican Party in the southern states of the US, with its backbone of fundamentalist evangelical Christians, than it is like other British political partiesGiven its undoubted influence in Westminster, the DUP has no need to share power with anybody in Northern Ireland and is likely to do even better than before in the next election there.Yet the DUP remains a stranger movement than most people notice when watching its MPs being interviewed by the British media. At its core are two highly sectarian and regressive organisations: the Free Presbyterian Church, founded by Ian Paisley in 1951, and the Orange Order.Three in 10 (30.5 per cent) of the DUP membership belong to the Free Presbyterians according to The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest to Power by Jonathan Tonge, Maire Braniff and others, who interviewed three-quarters of the party’s members. This is a high proportion of the DUP given that there are only 10,068 Free Presbyterians, who make up 0.6 per cent of the Northern Irish population.Belonging to the Orange Order is the other feature which distinguishes the DUP, with 34.6 per cent of members belonging to an organisation whose determination to parade through Catholic areas has frequently provoked sectarian violence in the past (though much reduced today by the rerouting or banning of parades going through sensitive areas).The DUP is thus much more like the Republican Party in the southern states of the US, with its backbone of fundamentalist evangelical Christians, than it is like other British political parties. Its social policies on issues like abortion are regressive and it has a tradition of homophobia that has not changed since Ian Paisley led the “Save Ulster from Sodomy” campaign in 1977.The fortuitous political triumph of the DUP comes at the moment when the Protestant and unionist community is on the retreat socially and demographicallyLord Patten, the former Conservative Party chairman and EU commissioner, who is one of the few British political leaders with knowledge of Northern Ireland, is quoted as saying in a newspaper interview this week that Theresa May’s deal with the DUP in 2017 was “a huge mistake”. He believes that the British government has “compromised its balanced position on Northern Ireland in order to get into bed with the DUP”.The DUP denies that it wants a hard border, which would be economically devastating for many of the businessmen and farmers who vote for the party. But it is widely suspected in Northern Ireland that this is not true and that at heart the party does want a hard border iding Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic because this would be a death blow to the Good Friday Agreement. Foster said last October that the agreement was not “sacrosanct” and could be changed in order to take account of Brexit.“The DUP were never in favour of the GFA,” says Morris, arguing that there is nothing surprising about the party’s hostility to the Good Friday Agreement. “They voted against it at the time. Why should they protect it now? It was meant to have fairly similar nationalists and unionist forming a government. But the DUP and Sinn Fein disagree on almost every economic and social policy. They don’t even agree what to call the place: Sinn Fein still calls it the North and the DUP Northern Ireland.”Surprisingly Sinn Fein leaders do not sound concerned about the DUP’s predominance, arguing that it is only temporary and will end as soon as the DUP no longer holds the balance of power in Westminster. There may be an element of wishful thinking in this and political parties all like to imagine that the successes of their opponents are Pyrrhic victories. But Lord Patten argues that the DUP does “more for Sinn Fein than Sinn Fein does by undermining confidence in the existing economic and political relationships between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, Europe and the Republic of Ireland”.The Catholic community is relying on another long-term factor which it believes will negate any tactical gains made by the DUP. Their numbers are growing faster than the Protestants and they will be in the majority by 2021, which is coincidentally the hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the Northern Irish state.Of equal importance is that the Catholic community is becoming more prosperous and better educated than the Protestants. Once it was the Catholics who worked in menial jobs and had twice the unemployment rate of Protestants – 18 per cent compared to 9 per cent in 1972 – but this gap has disappeared. The Catholic middle class was the great beneficiary of the peace process and Catholics make up 60 per cent of those in higher education.Karen Bradley’s ‘mistake’ reveals far more than just her ignoranceQueens University in Belfast is increasingly seen as a “green” institution, while Protestants often go to Scottish or English universities and many do not return after graduating. Catholics increasingly dominate professions like law, medicine, and accountancy.“The professional classes are increasingly populated by the nationalist community,” says Dr Kyle, adding that young working-class Protestants in east Belfast would historically have gone into the shipyards and worked as welders, painters, plumbers – heavy industrial jobs which have now disappeared. Ironically, Catholics were less vulnerable to de-industrialisation because discrimination had prevented them getting the industrial jobs that have now disappeared. \u0026nbspMorris recounts her own family background to illustrate this trend: “My mother was a cleaner, she had eight children my father was mainly unemployed because of the Troubles. She was pulled out of school when she was 14 to mind the other children, but she was obsessed with education, as many Catholic families were, and she pushed us all to go to grammar school.”The fortuitous political triumph of the DUP comes at the moment when the Protestant and unionist community is on the retreat socially and demographically.Dr Kyle says that “most unionists would feel that it is only a matter of time before a majority of the population are from nationalist or Republican backgrounds”. He believes that DUP “arrogance and smugness”, and its effort to impose Brexit despite a majority in Northern Ireland being opposed to it (56 to 44 per cent in the referendum in 2016), will be counterproductive because it alienates nationalists and middle-class unionists.The Good Friday Agreement is being undermined by the prospect of a hard border despite its great success as a historic compromise between the two communities. The economic benefits are visible everywhere. politan Belfast, with a population of 600,000, looks more prosperous than many cities in the rest of the UK.It is this success which is now being put at risk. That does not mean there will be a rerun of the Troubles after 1968-69, but it does mean that friction between Catholics and Protestants is on the rise again after falling in recent years.Morris recalls reporting on Orange Order parades around 12 July, usually a peak point in sectarian violence. “I would often return home at four or five in the morning covered in bruises from metal bolts thrown during the parades,” she says. But clashes have become far less frequent and in the last three years, she says: “I have often found myself sitting in a bar with a glass of wine in my hand by seven in the evening.” \u0026nbspThis trend could go into reverse as Brexit pushes up the political temperature in Northern Ireland. The lack of concern and ignorance about what might happen is illustrated by the way in which Brexiteers denounce the backstop as a conspiracy by the EU and the Irish Republic to trap Britain in the customs union rather than as a necessary measure to prevent a hard border which would topple the Good Friday Agreement.The GFA was probably the greatest achievement of the British state over the last half century. The DUP would like to see it go or strip it of any meaning, and it may well succeed. As during the general election of 1969, Northern Ireland is once more at the crossroads.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

They have just had their 200 dairy cows and 21 sheep slaughteredAn auction worker herds two cows around the sales ring at the first cattle auction in the UK since the outbreak, amid tight bio-security measures at the Orkney Auction Mart in KirkwallCattle-buyers wearing protective suits appear in good spirits at the start of the first cattle auction in the UKBut yesterday the weekly auction was back as a venue for socialising, with groups of farmers in small huddles exchanging laughs and stories as they watched their livestock fetch prices comparable to those before the epidemic.The first cattle to be sold, a group of four\u0026nbspCharolais\u0026nbspsteers from the outlying island of\u0026nbspWestray, sold within seconds at\u0026nbsp10am\u0026nbspto a buyer for\u0026nbspKepac, a meat supplier in\u0026nbspBuchan, Aberdeenshire, for £614 a head.Cattle sales are permitted only in Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles at present, but a relaxing of the restriction from 1 September will allow sheep and cattle to be auctioned in the official disease-free area, which takes in all of Scotland except the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway.How the crisis spread20 February: outbreak at Cheale Meats abattoir in Essex and adjoining farm confirmed after vet finds boils on pigs21 February: government and European Commission ban meat, livestock and milk exports from Britain22 February: walkers banned from farmland. Fox hunting suspended24 February: slaughter of livestock begins27 February: agriculture minister\u0026nbspNick Brow, announces £200m compensation for farmers1 March: outbreaks in Northern Ireland and Scotland confirmed. Cost of epidemic put at £2.6bn8 March: more than 100 cases. Chief veterinary officer\u0026nbspJim Scudamore\u0026nbspsays outbreak will last ‘for a long time’13 March: first case in France. US and Canada ban European exports22 March: first case in Ireland. About 50 new cases reported daily28 March: Blair asks public to visit rural areas to limit cost to tourism2 April: Blair announces general election will be held on 7 June23 April: suspected case of human catching virus25 April: Phoenix the calf saved from cull3 May: Blair says UK is in ‘home straight’\u0026nbspafter 1,536 cases and 2.5 million slaughtered4 May: hundreds of footpaths reopened7 May: government announces £24m package to help businesses £625m expected for farmers3 July: cost to tourism put at up to £4bn18 July: Blair rules out public inquiry9 August: start of three independent inquiries20 August: first sale of live cattle since start of crisis, in Orkney islandsAt the Kirkwall sale, Jim Walker, president of the National Farmers’ Union Scotland (NFUS), warned that complacency could reignite the epidemic. “We have to remember that foot-and-mouth is still raging across the border in England,” he said. “The last thing we want is for it to start up again in Scotland, because then all the games are off, and we’ve got 3.5 million animals to shift between now and the end of the year.“We have been through hell and back and this is a small but important step forward. There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

That is why a stodgy literary biopic like The Life of Emile Zola somehow won the main award at the 1937 Oscars. It’s a solid and worthy piece of work, with a grandstanding performance from Paul Muni (under a lot of whiskers) as the campaigning French novelist. The idea, though, that it is one of the “few truly great pictures of all time”, as its own publicity suggested, is clearly idiotic.It may seem churlish to go after an underdog like Rocky but this was an undeserving Best Picture winner. The Academy voters in 1976 acted as if they were punch drunk and had spent too long in the ring with Apollo Creed. The problem with its victory wasn’t so much the film itself but with the other nominees that were spurned in its favour. Taxi Driver, All the President’s Men and Network all surely had a better claim to that year’s statuette.310 8. Around the World in 80 DaysThis was a perfectly amiable big-budget travelogue but you can’t help but suspect its Best Picture Oscar was more to do with the marketing and hustling skills of its producer, Mike Todd, than with any brilliance in the filmmaking. It was directed by the Englishman Michael Anderson, previously best known for The Dam Busters, and featured David Niven as the intrepid traveller, Phileas Fogg, who bets he can travel all the way round the world in a little over two months.Paul Haggis’s Crash is a decent and well-meaning study of the consequences of racism and violence in contemporary LA. It was independently made and had a large ensemble cast, all giving heartfelt performances. However, Robert Altman had covered similar territory better in Short Cuts and the feeling persisted that it had won the Best Picture award because some Academy voters were determined not to give the Oscar to the gay-themed contemporary western Brokeback Mountain.You rarely win an Oscar without a strong marketing campaign. The now disgraced distributorproducer Harvey Weinstein knew the secrets of getting Academy voters on his side better than anyone else in the business. Whether it was the Blitz-like approach to advertising in the trade press, or the timing of the awards screenings, or the way he kept the film’s stars in front of the media or his relentless courtship of the Academy members, he was arguably as important to the Oscar success of the so-so musical Chicago as any of the creative talent behind it.It’s not bad. It’s a love story that touches on mental illness and mathematics (neither usually subjects that Hollywood embraces). Russell Crowe gives a fine performance as John Nash, the Nobel prize-winning boffin with the beautiful but unstable mind. Nonetheless, Ron Howard’s biopic isn’t any kind of classic. It won its Best Picture Oscar in an unusually thin year.Marty, the 1955 winner, isn’t even the best version of its own subject matter. This story, scripted by the great Paddy Chayevsky, about an emotionally repressed Italian American butcher from the Bronx looking for love, had already been made as a live TV drama the year before. In the small-screen version, Rod Steiger gave a superlative performance in the lead role. Ernest Borgnine in the film version can’t help but seem like second best to anyone who saw Steiger in the same part. Whereas the puggish Borgnine makes Marty a figure of pity, Steiger turned him into a full blown tragic hero.810 3. Out of AfricaYou’ll remember the pink flamingos and all those scenes of beautiful Kenyan landscapes that looked as if they were cribbed from a David Attenborough natural history documentary. You won’t ever forget Meryl Streep’s eccentric accent as the Danish baroness and author, Karen Blixen (“I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong hills”). This is mushy stuff, though, and hardly deserving of its Oscar.This rousing, Scottish-set (but partly Irish-filmed) medieval epic is famous for its scenes of William Wallace’s army in blue faces lifting their kilts and baring their bums. Regardless of how accurate this was as history, it played into ongoing debates about devolution and Scottish independence. The film also did its bit for the Scottish tourism business. Mel Gibson knows how to stage a battle scene. Whether that qualifies his film for a Best Picture Oscar is another matter.1010 1. The Greatest Show on EarthFrom a vantage point 67 years on, the decision to give the Best Picture Oscar to Cecil B DeMille’s circus epic in 1952 is truly baffling. British viewers who have seen it will almost certainly have done so on TV (where its 152-minute running time made it useful for filling in gaps in the schedule). It has a decent cast and some reasonable stunts but Academy voters were surely clowning around when they chose it over other nominees in the same year which have aged far, far better like High Noon and The Quiet Man.110 10.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe Model Y seats seven and has a panoramic glass roof and a 15-inch (38-centimeter) touchscreen interface for accessing all the car\u0027s controls.\u0026nbspThe all-electric, mid-size SUV will start at $39,000 for the standard range version, which the company said can go 230 miles (370 kilometers) on a single charge. The long-range model, which starts at $47,000, has a range of up to 300 miles (483 kilometers) on a single charge - less range than the Model 3.\u0026nbspA dual-motor, all-wheel drive version of the Model Y starts at $51,000 while the performance version of the car, which boasts acceleration of 0-60 mph (97 kph) in as little as 3.5 seconds and a top speed of up to 150 mph (241 kph), starts at $60,000.The Model Y may be Tesla\u0027s most important product yet as it attempts to expand into the mainstream and generate enough cash to repay massive debts that threaten to topple the Palo Alto, California, company.\u0026nbspTesla got a huge boost toward ensuring its survival with the 2017 debut of its Model 3 sedan, but an SUV could have even more mass appeal, given how popular SUVs have become in the U.S., Europe and Canada.\u0026nbspThe U.S. market share for SUVs, crossovers, vans and pickup trucks stood at 69 percent in January, up from just 48.5 percent a decade ago, according to the research firm IHS Markit.\u0026nbspBut most SUVs still run on gasoline, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative. The Model Y\u0027s main competition in this still-nascent market is likely to be the Mercedes-Benz EQC, and to a lesser extent, the Jaguar I-Pace, according to the research firm LMC Automotive.\u0026nbspThis could be Tesla\u0027s most profitable vehicle, with the giant asterisk that the company doesn\u0027t do some of the dumb things it has in the past, said Gartner analyst Mike Ramsey.\u0026nbspMany of Tesla\u0027s past follies have been tied to Musk\u0027s penchants for making grandiose promises that the company hasn\u0027t been able to keep in terms of production, delivery and execution.\u0026nbspProduction of the Model 3 quickly fell behind schedule as Tesla struggled to come up with adequate manufacturing capacity and it took much longer than anticipated to lower the sedan\u0027s starting price to the $35,000 level that Musk had been promoting. Instead, the lowest priced version of the Model 3 had been selling for $43,000 until a couple weeks ago when Tesla reached the promised price point by laying off thousands of workers and imposing other cost-cutting measures.\u0026nbspOverseeing the ramp-up of Model 3\u0027s production nearly drove Musk to exhaustion last year, a factor that may have contributed to a mystifying pattern of behavior that included tweeting about having lined up the financing for a potential buyout of Tesla. That misleading statement jeopardized his job and resulted in a $40 million settlement with stock market regulators.\u0026nbspMusk alluded to the troubled production of the Model 3 during his remarks to the crowd Thursday night.\u0026nbspBecause of extreme challenges with the Model 3 production, we have to basically allocate all resources to Model 3 production, because otherwise we\u0027re going to die, Musk said with a chuckle, eliciting laughs from the crowd.\u0026nbspHe then added: 2018 probably felt like aging five years in one. It was really intense.\u0026nbspTesla expects to deliver the performance, long range, rear-wheel drive and dual-motor, all-wheel drive versions of the Model Y in the fall of 2020. The standard version of the Model Y is expected to roll out in the spring of 2021.\u0026nbspAs with all electric vehicles, the distance that the Model Y can cover on a fully charged battery is likely to be one of its key selling points - or downsides. Teslapegged the Model Y\u0027s range at up to 300 miles compared to 325 miles for the Model 3.\u0026nbspTesla is hoping there will pent-up demand for the Model Y, nearly four years after Musk first began touting the company\u0027s plans to make an SUV. Bringing in early down payments for the vehicles would help Tesla generate the cash it needs to repay nearly $1.7 billion in loans that come due within the next 16 months.\u0026nbspThe company began the year with about $11 billion in debt and $3.7 billion in cash, but those figures presumably fell recently when it repaid about $920 million in bonds.\u0026nbspAnother $566 million in notes are scheduled to be repaid this November followed a $1.1 billion credit line in June 2020.\u0026nbspConsumers who plop down their deposits for the Model Y may have to cross their fingers for their vehicles to be delivered on schedule.\u0026nbspTesla\u0027s recurring production and delivery problems have resulted in consumers having to wait longer than they were originally told. Musk now says Tesla has worked out those issues.\u0026nbspRamsey, though, remains skeptical about whether the company will have adequate manufacturing capacity for the Model Y. He expects the Model Y\u0027s journey to the mass market to provide another wild ride for the company, its investors and customers.\u0026nbspUntil Elon is gone, Tesla is going to be a crazy company that occasionally makes breathtaking products, Ramsey predicted.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is not compatible with WTO rules and it’s the start of a process where they’ll have to get approvals,” he told reporters in Dublin.“If they want to operate on the basis of being in defiance of well-established WTO rules well then that’s their decision. But ultimately that will not succeed because they will be taken to a panel of dispute settlement.”The commissioner, who is Ireland’s member on the EU’s executive, added: “I think the timing of it was unfortunate and it was a deliberate attempt to put Ireland more on the agenda, as if it wasn’t on the agenda already.”Brexit plan to slash tariffs after no deal condemned as ‘madness’He claimed that the “stunt” was an attempt by the UK to “weaken the unity of the EU26 in relation to the Irish backstop”.The UK plan would mean that 82 per cent of imports from the EU would be tariff-free, down from 100 per cent now.Imports from the rest of the world would be 92 per cent tariff-free, up from the current 56 per cent.The WTO’s “most favoured nation” rule, which the UK would have to follow after Brexit, means that countries must treat other WTO members equally in terms of tariffs and quotas, unless they have a recognised free trade agreement in place.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coffins of victims of the crashed accident of Ethiopian Airlines are gathered during the mass funeral at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

She had agreed to allow her MPs a free vote on that motion in order to let her ided cabinet ministers vote as they pleased without having to resign.Her hand was forced, however, when backbenchers put forward an amendment calling for a no-deal Brexit to be ruled out at any stage - not just on 29 March.\u0026nbspLabour abandons support for referendum on May\u0027s Brexit dealThat motion narrowly passed, despite the government whipping its MPs to vote against it.The amended motion was then put to another\u0026nbspvote, with Ms May forced into the farcical\u0026nbspsituation of ordering her MPs\u0026nbspto oppose the\u0026nbspmotion - now amended - that she herself had put forward.\u0026nbspBut her efforts were in vain, as MPs backed the proposal by 321 votes to 278 - a majority of 43.Four cabinet ministers - Amber Rudd, David Gauke, Greg Clark and David Mundell - and a handful of junior ministers\u0026nbspignored party orders to vote against the motion and instead\u0026nbspabstained, raising the prospect of them being\u0026nbspsacked.During another evening of dramatic votes in the Commons, MPs also comprehensively rejected a proposal that would have seen the UK leave the EU without an exit deal on 22 May.\u0026nbspSpeaking immediately after suffering her latest Commons setback,\u0026nbspMs May\u0026nbspsaid the government would now bring forward a motion, to be voted on tomorrow,\u0026nbspproposing an extension to the\u0026nbspArticle 50 process.The motion says that if the Commons passes a Brexit deal by 20 March, Brexit will be delayed until the end of June. If no deal is agreed by 20 March, however, the motion suggests that a much longer extension is likely to follow.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMs May\u0026nbsptold the Commons: If the House finds a way in the coming days to support a deal, it would allow the government to seek a short limited technical extension to Article 50 to provide time to pass the necessary legislation and ratify the agreement we have reached with the EU.But let me be clear: such a short technical extension is only likely to be on offer if we have a deal in place.She continued: Therefore, the House has to understand and accept that, if it is not willing to support a deal in the coming days, and as it is not willing to support leaving without a deal on 29 March, then it is suggesting that there will need to be a much longer extension to Article 50.\u0026nbsp Such an extension would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament elections in May 2019.I do not think that would be the right outcome, but the House needs to face up to the consequences of the decisions it has taken.We’ll tell you what’s true.

That’s very nice. Yes, we had a good discussion. Yes, our conference voted on a comprehensive motion which is about all the issues relating to Europe, but our priority is to get a general election, but yes we do support the principle.”Asked again he said: “I’m enthusiastic about getting a deal with Europe which guarantees our future trading relationship and protects jobs and industries in this country and I do think people should have a choice in that.”Farage leads pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave march from Sunderland to LondonPressed again, he named his priorities as avoiding a no-deal Brexit, protecting jobs and\u0026nbsphaving a trading relationship with Europe, before adding, “and a choice, a real credible choice that people can make on the future relationship with Europe”.When a clear\u0026nbspamendment backing a new referendum was put before the Commons last week, Mr Corbyn whipped MPs to abstain. The motion was also not supported by the People’s Vote campaign, which argued that it was not the right time to bring it forward.But 41 of his MPs rebelled, with 24 supporting a referendum and 17 voting to oppose one.

We hope that once we’ve got a Brexit dealt we will be able to resume the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland and then of course we will need to look at the spending review in that context.”When the DUP agreed to prop up Ms May’s administration in the commons after the 2017 election, the party negotiated an extra £1bn\u0026nbspin spending for Northern Ireland over 2018 and 2019.Money in the agreement, and potentially the support of the party’s 10\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspfor Ms May, is set to end in June, creating the opportunity for its leader\u0026nbspArlene Foster\u0026nbspto negotiate new terms, with the government’s main ask likely to be safe passage of her\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal.Up until the end of last week talks with the DUP had been largely legal discussions with attorney general Geoffrey Cox, but the involvement of Mr Hammond\u0026nbspindicated\u0026nbspthere was a\u0026nbspfinancial element to the meetings.Doods denies ‘cash for votes’ over Theresa May’s Brexit dealShadow chancellor John McDonnell hit out at Mr Hammond’s comments on Sunday, saying: “From his interview with Marr this morning and his wriggling refusal on several occasions to deny the DUP is being offered a bung for voting for May’s deal, it is blindingly obvious that Hammond is offering a bribe to the DUP in the forthcoming spending review. Gutter politics.”Mr Hammond said the expected vote on Tuesday on Ms May’s deal would\u0026nbsphappen only if the prime minister thought she had enough support to pass it, echoing words from trade secretary Liam Fox earlier in the day.He said it was not now “physically possible” for the UK to leave\u0026nbspthe EU on 29 March as previously planned, because no deal has been ruled out by MPs, an approved deal is not in place and, even if MPs\u0026nbspback one, a little more time is needed to pass necessary legislation.But in a warning to Brexiteers who are still thinking about opposing the deal on Tuesday, he said: “It’s absolutely vital that we get it through next week because otherwise\u0026nbspthis is the final chance to do this deal without having to have a long extension of the Article 50 period. I’m clear about that.”Mr Hammond went on to dodge\u0026nbspa question about whether he might ever say to the prime minister that it is time for her to resign.“The prime minister is absolutely focused on getting her deal through parliament. She’s passionate about because she passionately believes this deal is the best exit deal for Britain from the European Union.“If she doesn’t get it through then I’m sure she’ll be equally committed to ensuring a process that allows parliament to find an alternative way forward.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Political editor Joe Watts looks at what they might be promisingClick to followIndy Politics‘We are not discussing cash,’ insists DUP Westminster leader Nigel DoddsWhen Philip Hammond, Michael Gove, Theresa May’s deputy David Lidington and chief whip Julian Smith all sit down to make you an offer, you know it is going to be a serious one.This was the assembled cast earlier in the week as the government began the difficult business of trying to convince their Northern Irish partners to back the prime minister’s\u0026nbspBrexit deal – absolutely critical to its chances of passing through the Commons on Tuesday.The\u0026nbspDUP have long taken an absolutist line on refusing to back her withdrawal agreement because of the presence of the Irish backstop.But there has always been a suspicion in some quarters that the ferocity of their opposition is a handy facade, appearing to be tough-as-nails negotiators to get what they want.The fact that they are still in talks at all\u0026nbspshows that they are prepared to cut a deal regardless of whether the backstop in the agreement is changed, since that is no longer possible.Hammond says cash to Belfast will be reviewed amid Brexit ‘bung’ claimThat they agreed a confidence-and-supply deal with the government two years ago for an extra £1bn in spending in Northern Ireland also suggests they are not immune to the pull of hard cash.So taking in what can be gleaned from public statements and private steers, it looks like the offer being worked on can be ided into three categories: weakening the grip of the backstop\u0026nbspensuring Northern Ireland does not erge from the rest of Britain and financial sweeteners.The first might end up being addressed by a unilateral declaration from the UK government that it will, if needs be, use international law to get out of the backstop so hated by Eurosceptics.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThe backstop is an arrangement that comes into play in December 2020 if no new trade deal has been signed by the UK and EU by then. Its purpose is ostensibly to ensure the Irish border stays open, but it would also have the effect of potentially keeping the UK in a customs union with Brussels indefinitely.While recent additions to the withdrawal agreement have strengthened the UK’s ability to leave the arrangement in some circumstances, the new declaration would commit a future British government to determinedly using international law to try and escape it.Corbyn indicates he could vote Leave in a second Brexit referendumThe government is said to be trying to address the ergence questions with a new “Stormont\u0026nbsplock”, some legal text to be enshrined in the yet-to-be-passed withdrawal agreement bill stating\u0026nbspthat any new regulation pushed upon Northern Ireland from Brussels while the UK remains in the backstop\u0026nbspwould be accepted or rejected by the whole UK as one.One area that falls into the financial sweetener category is the possibility that Northern Ireland would be allowed to reduce air passenger duty, which is currently lower in the Republic of Ireland, putting the north at a competitive disadvantage.Then there is likely to be the lump sum cash element, which will probably not become clear until a spending review later in the year. That will give ministers in London and politicians in Belfast cover to deny support has been bought in any way.The DUP –\u0026nbspand it is the Northern Irish party in the driving seat of these talks – has a propensity for cutting deals at the last second, so chances are there will be no sign of a breakthrough until late Monday or even Tuesday.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Or was it just another slip of the tongue by the former vice president with a reputation for veering off script?In a keynote speech at a dinner for the Delaware Democratic Party on Saturday, Mr Biden boasted he has “the most progressive record of anybody running.”The only problem is Mr Biden has not announced whether he will launch a third run for the White House, despite repeatedly teasing the possibility.He quickly corrected himself, clarifying that he meant to say “anybody who would run,” then adding “I didn’t mean it” while a cheering crowd in his home state nearly drowned him out.Although Mr Biden has been known to go off script, his remark is likely to be viewed as a Washington-style gaffe – a case of accidentally telling the truth.Created with Sketch.Who could be running against Trump in 2020?

One man is seen kicking the boy while he is on the ground. On Sunday, the prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters: “The full force of the law should be applied to Senator Anning.” Victoria Police has said it is investigating the actions of the senator and his supporters as well as those of the teenager.One of those who tackled the boy was far-right activist Neil Erikson, who was controlling access to the building. During the scuffle to apprehend the boy, he shouted for reporters to be removed from the area. “Get the journalists out of here ... If you don’t like, get out,” Erikson said, according to The Sun-Herald newspaper. While the child was being held in a chokehold, one of Mr Anning’s supporters is heard telling him: “You are nothing but a weak human f***ing being, you f***ing prick.”New Zealand attacker’s gun club was reported to police, man claimsDeath toll from New Zealand terror attacks rises to 50Egg a day may increase heart attack risk, study saysThe teenager has won considerable support for egging the far-right senator.

More eggs.”But it was later updated to say the 17-year-old “is committed to sending a majority of the money to the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attack.”In a video posted after the egging incident the boy urged people not to follow his example. “Don’t egg politicians. You get tackled by 30 bogans at the same time,” he said in the video, using Australian slang for an unsophisticated person. “I learnt the hard way,” he added. Mr Anning caused outrage after the attack in which 50 Muslims were killed in two mosques, with a statement calling Islam “the religious equivalent of fascism”.He said: “The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.“Let us be clear, while Muslims may have been the victims today, usually they are the perpetrators. World-wide, Muslims are killing people in the name of their faith on an industrial scale.”He added: “The truth is that Islam is not like any other faith. It is the religious equivalent of fascism. And just because the followers of this savage belief were not the killers in this instance, does not make them blameless.”A Change.org petition to remove him from parliament has accrued almost a million signatures and has made it the biggest and fastest-growing petition ever hosted on the platform.

minister’s party could be expelled from EU’s largest political groupClick to followThe IndependentViktor Orban is facing calls for greater scrutiny of his government’s spending of EU funds as tensions between the Hungarian prime minister and the EU near breaking point.More than 470,000 people have signed a petition to pressure Mr Orban’s government into joining the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO), the EU’s new anti-corruption watchdog for EU funding.Alongside the petition, Mr Orban’s Fidesz party is also at risk of being suspended or expelled next week from the main centre-right group in the European parliament.The EU has allocated €25bn (£21.3bn) to Hungary in the 2014-2020 budget period and critics have warned funds are often spent on overpriced or unnecessary projects that benefit allies of the prime minister.Mr Orban is known for his anti-EU and anti-immigration campaigns,\u0026nbspand his accusations that the EU is increasing its powers to the detriment of member

Hadhazy launched a petition in September with the hope of gathering 1 million signatures to pressure Hungary’s government into joining the EPPO, which is expected to begin investigations at the end of 2020.Mr Hadhazy and other critics say the country’s chief prosecutor, Peter Polt, has failed to investigate many cases of suspected corruption, some of which allegedly\u0026nbspconcern Mr Orban’s family.“There are two bastions that keep this populist regime in power – one is the chief prosecutor and the other is public media and government propaganda,” Mr Hadhazy said last week while helping activists gather signatures.\u0026nbspMr Polt “has been successfully attempting to whitewash the corruption affairs involving the Hungarian government ... and the most prominent politicians,” he added.\u0026nbspEU centre-right group to debate kicking out Viktor Orban’s partyForeign minister Peter Szijjarto defended Mr Polt on Monday, calling criticism of the former Fidesz parliamentary candidate “a coordinated series of political attacks”.In a recent survey on corruption in the public sector by Transparency International, Hungary was ranked 26th out of 28 EU countries.Only Greece and Bulgaria had lower scores for their anti-corruption measures.Although more than 470,000 Hungarians have signed Mr Hadhazy’s petition so far, it is not legally binding.The government has rejected joining the EPPO, citing national sovereignty concerns and even misgivings about its quality.\u0026nbspThe list of renovations and constructions partly funded by the EU in Budapest includes €572m\u0026nbsp(£487m)\u0026nbspgiven for the city’s fourth subway line, €37.5m (£32m) for the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, and €10.5m (£8.9m) for construction at City Park’s ice-skating rink, the largest in Europe.Hungary may have to repay funds to the EU if projects are found to not comply with EU rules, but observers say there is plenty left over for government allies.“In the past years, it has become clear that there are a few businesspeople close to the government whose companies nearly always win the large public contracts,” said Katalin Erdelyi, an award-winning journalist for investigative news site\u0026nbspatlatszo.hu.\u0026nbsp“The investments are frequently overpriced, costing much more than initial estimates.”\u0026nbspViktor Orban of ‘fake news’Ms Erdelyi said\u0026nbspthere are projects that appear to be built with the only purpose of using as much of the EU’s funds as possible.One of those projects is a bridge and “bicycle adventure park” that runs through the town of Hatvan and is used by few bikers due to safety concerns over its construction.“It would be very good if Hungary joined the European Prosecutor’s Office,” Ms Erdelyi said.\u0026nbsp“It would be much easier to uncover the deals suspected of corruption and confirm whether or not there was any misuse of European Union subsidies.”Mr Orban’s Fidesz party is also currently involved in a dispute with the European People’s Party, which is the largest political group in the European parliament.Fidesz could be suspended or ejected from the group when the EPP meets for its political assembly on 20 March over criticism of Mr Orban’s commitment to democratic principles.The Hungarian leader has repeatedly said he would prefer to stay in the centre-right alliance, in order to transform it into an anti-immigration force.The conflict between Fidesz and the EPP has been exacerbated by EU proceedings launched last year over concerns about the rule of law in Hungary since Mr Orban’s return to power in 2010.Hungarian MPs opposed to Orban ejected from state broadcaster’s HQThousands of Hungarians protest against Orban’s rule in BudapestSteve Bannon plans to advise Hungary’s far right PM Viktor OrbanSoros university targeted by Orban ‘forced out of Hungary’Istvan Hegedus, a former Fidesz MP and current chairman of the Hungarian Europe Society, says Mr Orban is unlikely to take Hungary out of the EU.Despite his clashes with the organisation, Mr Orban still relies on EU money.“The funds, in part, generated non-sustainable growth, but if these financial resources were to end, the Hungarian economy would be in a much more difficult situation,” Mr Hegedus said, naming EU farm subsidies as one of those vital for Hungary.“He will have to think over a thousand times whether he’ll give up these EU subsidies.”Agencies contributed to this reportWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Its a fantastic opportunity to build understanding across communities and educate ourselves about our erse communities. Lets build bridges not walls.The Muslim Welfare House in London released a statement after the incident, saying it the attacker had shouted and hurled verbal abuse to the utter shock and disgust of all present.Toufik Kacimi, CEO of the organisation, said: We condemn in the strongest terms this outrageous act which has left everyone shocked.This disgraceful act by this inidual is a sign of the hatred and Islamophobia that sadly abound in our community.We will not let this deter us from cooperating with all groups in building a more cohesive society.Other Labour figures who have been also hit with an egg include ex-Labour boss Ed Miliband, as well as John Prescott, who went on to punch the protester.Last week Mr Corbyn confirmed that his party would get behind a second Brexit referendum, much to the fury of his pro-Brexit voters.But MPs in Leave backing seats warned it could cost the party their seats - and the next election."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000470489108.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the independent group conservative mps political party","story":"Ex-Tory Heidi Allen today revealed more of her former colleagues were keen to join the Independent Group.And she hinted that the number was big enough to cost Theresa May her wafer-thin working majority of eight.Ms Allen told ITV: “We have more [potential defectors] than we could take in. We’re having to stem the enthusiasm there.“Two or three more would be as much as we could manage I think [to avoid destabilising the Conservatives].”The comment come as leaders of The Independent Groupprepare for exploratory talks with the Electoral Commission tomorrow to step up plans to become a fully fledged political party.Separately Labour began moves to boot ex-Labour MPs among TIG such as Luciana Berger off their seats in cross-party select cmmittees.TiG leader Chuka Umunna last month said the breakaway group hope to become a registered political party by the end of the year.But this could now be brought forward given the interest from other Tory and Labour MPs and polling which shows a staggering level of support for the new group.Ex-Labour MP Chris Leslie told The Sun: “The public deserve a better choice than Corbyn or an ever more right-wing Tory Party.“With politics this broken, we must urgently explore a new alternative for people at the ballot box.”So far, each of the  TIG MPs have defected from either Labour or the Conservatives and decided to sit as ‘Independents’ in their constituencies.Under Commission rules a new party has to provide information about its finances and constitution and to appoint people to the roles of party leader, treasurer and nominating officer. Crucially it would also be able to accept much larger donations – allowing it to run electoral campaigns."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000475971088-e1552610580150.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit deal self harm","story":"Some are waking up to it.

It is only even remotely possible under May’s deal. Remainers will prevent No Deal.Corbyn, meanwhile, plumbed pitul new depths of dishonesty last night.Having helped send the “people’s vote” crashing to a deserved defeat — to avoid offending his Leave voters — he absurdly reaffirmed his support for it to avoid offending Labour Remainers.Give it up, Jezza.

I got my two best friends to record me reading a scene from the movie and we stupidly decided to do it after a bottle of wine for Dutch courage.When I sent my audition tapes through I sounded more Irish than American and I missed out on a potentially huge role.I just wish I had put my mind to it more, but I didn’t really have an interest in acting back then.Kelly Rohrbach got the lead and looked amazing in it. The film wasn’t actually that great . . . but it would have been pretty cool to work alongside Zac Efron and The Rock.SET the controls for the best day of my childhood – Saturday July , , a glorious day of sunshine and showers when England won the FIFA World Cup Final against West Germany.Every second of it is etched in my mind – Nobby dancing, Bobby Moore’s golden aura and Kenneth Wolstenholme’s commentary.“There are people on the pitch – they think it’s all over – it is now!”It was a day to make you believe in magic.I watched it, aged , with my mum – my dad worked every weekend – and I squeaked “F***” when the Germans equalised to make it - at the end of normal time.It was the only time in my le that I ever said “F***” in front of my mum.She forgave me immediately “as it’s the Germans,” she said, the Blitz still fresh in her memory after  years – and went to put the kettle on as we settled down for extra time.It was a day of excitement, pride, patriotism, passion and pure, undiluted drama.WHEN I was a kid I wanted to be an astronautand also an RAF fighter pilot.I was lucky enough to be taken up in a Phantom jet in September , when I helped launch the annual air show at RAF Leuchars, in Fe.Awesome is an overused word, but not in this case.I was given training, poured into a G-suit and for the next hour I had the thrill ride of a letime.Obviously I did nothing but sit there enthralled while not touching any important buttons.We pulled three Gs, which was a bit like being cuddled by a gorilla, but women withstand G-Force better than men and, unlike Jeremy Clarkson, I managed not to throw up.At one point I was upside down and flying so fast I felt I had left my body behind.I wish I could go back in time to relive that moment again and again.I HAVE done a lot of really stupid things – often on purpose. When I told my mum I was leaving college to join a band she told me not to be stupid. But that actually worked out OK.For sure I’ve taken plenty of bad advice over the years and committed countless, colossal clangers.If I could go back in time I absolutely would but not to sort out any of my messes.I’d like to make something that was totally brilliant even more mind-blowingly brilliant than it was to start with.It would be to the summer of . I’d just got my new racing bike. That bike was my first true taste of freedom.I spent the whole summer tearing all over Dorset with my two best friends.I’m not sure anyone ever felt quite as free in the moment as that -year-old boy racing a new bike down a massive hill as fast as possible in the sunshine.There’s no way I’d let my kids do it now. Far too many cars on the road. But I can remember exactly how it felt, clear as anything. Woo-hoo.I WOULD go back to the autumn of , when I was living in New York.My flatmate was in real estate and he had got wind of an apartment building, jointly owned by the residents, that had gone bankrupt.He said you could now buy two-bedroom apartments in this building for as little as ,. It was a risk, sinceit didn’t come out of bankruptcy I’d lose everything.But the upside was thatit came out of bankruptcy, the flat would immediately multiply in value. He was going to buy one. Did I want to buy the one next door I owned a flat in London and could have drawn down on my mortgage to borrow the money.I ummed and ahhed about it and, eventually, chickened out. You can probably guess the rest.My flatmate bought an apartment for ,, the building’s finances were restored and it’s now worth .million.I would like nothing more than to use a time machine to buy the flat next door. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Starting over is just not an option — andNo Deal is unpalatable toMPs, then the obvious solution is to support leaving with a deal.Secondly, a y delay puts us in the awkward position of having to stand candidates for the European Parliament election.This would be a humiliation and the public would be right to be furious.Worse still, as part of an offer for a long extension, the EU may require us to hold a second referendum.Thirdly, we came dangerously close to a backbencher coup — where those who did not win the right to govern wish to take over the role of government, in an extra-ordinarily unconstitutional move that would overturn years of parliamentary conventions with the sole aim of stopping Brexit.Make no mistake, their motives were not to deliver a dferent Brexit or to honour the result of the referendum — it would be to stop Brexit in its tracks. All the while, our hard-working voters and our long-suffering businesses just want to get on with le beyond Brexit.In a survey by market researchers Survation, the majority of Conservative voters said they would take Theresa May’s deal over every other option — No Deal, a long delay or another referendum.There is, however, an obvious solution to all this — and every parliamentarian can choose to take it.I spend my days at the legislative coalface as Leader of the House of Commons. I know what we need to get done to leave the EU in a smooth fashion — and I also know that we do not need is a y extension.While the negotiators have been hard at it in Brussels, I’ve been preparing for and delivering the legislative changes needed for Brexit to make sure our laws work when we leave.So I know thatwe get this deal passed next week, we can deliver Brexit quickly — and potentially much faster than the end of June.If both Houses — the Lords and the Commons — acknowledge the country’s desire to get this settled, we can crack on with passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.A short extension to get the legislation finalised is far better than a long one — which would come with unacceptable conditions we have no control over.In setting out the parliamentary timetable, I will, as I always do, fully respect Parliament’s desire to scrutinise and debate.But I will also be looking to move quickly, so Parliament can turn its attention to the wealth of opportunity that awaits us when we leave the EU.As I said at the dispatch box this week, this is an important time for Parliament and there have been dficult decisions to make.With such strongly held views across the House, it’s vital that we continue to listen to each other with respect and understanding.Over the centuries, the country has looked on as Parliament has faced historic decisions.Even in the most challenging of times, we have pulled together and put our duty above all .So I hope the House will now find a consensus that delivers on the will of the people to leave the EU as close to March  as possible.We can then, finally, turn our eyes to the bright future ahead of us and seek to reinstate confidence in British politics.Let’s do our duty — and do our country proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We all stand united as brothers and sisters”.Her defiant words are a fitting epitaph for the New Zealand victims: “We must tell them you will not win.”ENOUGH is enough on the Brexit shambles. We want out as soon as possible.A poll today shows that  per cent want PM Theresa May to ignore MPs and leave the EU without a deal.Buther exit plan does not get past Parliament, Britain’s departure could be postponed for two years. As Andrea Leadsom says, a y delay would be humiliating.MPs must unite behind the deal on the table — or waste the chance of a letime to wave goodbye to Brussels.Sort it. Anything  is a betrayal.TRAGIC Jade Goody’s most worthwhile legacy is sadly being squandered.The -year-old’s death from cervical cancer ten years ago was a wake-up call for millions of women. But the smear test rates that shot up after she lost her le have now plummeted to record lows.Backed by this newspaper, the NHS is urging women to take the le-saving test.So our message is don’t delay, go today.

I under­stand these talks were broadly positive. One Cabinet minister close to the process tells me the chances of the DUP backing the deal are, “a bit better than :. I’d put it at :”.What is winning round the DUP is the promise of putting into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which puts the deal into UK law, a requirement that there be no ergence between Northern Ireland and Britain.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be so-called superior legislation. This would mean it would trump any other bill, giving the DUP some reassurance that the next Prime Minister couldn’t let regulatory dferences emerge between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland.Parliament will also be given a scrutiny power over the backstop, allowing it to vote every few years on how it is operating.At the same time, the UK Government will seek to offer the DUP some reassurance about this country’s ability to get out of the backstop. I am told thatAttorney General Geoffrey Cox’s legal advice had been dferent, then the DUP would have been on board this week. One Cabinet minister tells me:“Geoffrey did cost the DUP.”To sweeten the deal for the DUP, there will be money and ladles of respect. The DUP want a new “policy package” to replace their confidence and supply deal with the Tories which runs out in June.To say that these negotiations are delicate would be an understatement. I am told, “ people put too much pressure on them, there’s a danger that they’ll bolt”.But with this Speaker and this Parliament any hopes for a better one, or for a clean break, seem for the birds.As James Forsyth says, the “big beasts” of the backbenches must show some leadership.Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Iain Duncan Smith were leading lights of the Leave campaign, but by not backing the deal they are now imperilling the whole project. They won’t be forgiven.Good card players know when to hold ’em and know when to fold ’em.Wise politicians must be no dferent.Butthe Government can get the DUP, it is confident that Jacob Rees-Mogg will then come on board.Despite voting against the deal on Tuesday, European Research Group chairman Rees-Mogg left himself a ladder to climb down, repeat­edly declaring that the only reason to vote for this deal wasBrexit was in genuine danger.After the Commons voted against No Deal and for an extension, it clearly is.The big question is how many Brexiteer rebels climb down Jacob’s ladder. Downing Street think there are  to  Tory diehards who won’t vote for the deal even with the DUP on board.The precise number is absolutely crucial. As one senior Downing Street source explains: “If it is at the lower end of that scale, it can be made up with Labour. If it is at the higher end, it can’t be.”There are, I’m told, between  and  Labour MPs prepared to back a deal but onlyit has a realistic chance of passing. Influential figures in the Cabinet are urging No to make the vote on Tuesday a free vote, to make it easier for Labour MPs to support it.If the deal doesn’t pass on Tuesday, then Mrs May will have to go to the European Council on Thursday and beg for a full-on extension to the Article  process. I am told she is dreading this personal and national humiliation.The Commons should spare her and, more importantly, the country, that.RIGHT now there is little sign that either Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab are going to move and back the Brexit deal.Both feel that their reservations about it are still too strong.But there is a danger for them both –  Tory Eurosceptics voted against the deal on Tuesday night.Whatever happens with the DUP, that number will drop a bit when the meaningful vote comes back for a third time.The danger for Boris and Raab is thatthey walk through the lobbies with this shrinking group, they will start to be seen as purely factional candidates, and purely factional candidates rarely win leadership contests.Already some of those who backed Boris last time and had been planning to do so again are peeling away.Now is a moment that calls for bigness.If either Boris or Raab were prepared to say that – despite their reservations – they were going to try to get the deal over the line, because Brexit is only going to get softer otherwise, they would show they have the selflessness necessary to lead.WHEN your voice is going, what’s the last thing that you want  A meeting with a heavy smoker.But that is what Theresa May had to contend with on Monday after she flew to Strasbourg for last-minute talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.By Wednesday, Mrs May’s voice was so bad that No had a plan for Andrea Leadsom,  to take over halfway through PMQsher voice gave out completely.TO get people to do things you need both a carrot and a stick.But the problem for the Government is that its warnings to Brexiteer rebels are all stick.It is pointing out that Brexit will only get softerMPs don’t vote for the deal. This is right, but these MPs need a positive inducement too.One Tory who carries messages from Theresa May’s Downing Street to the Brexiteer rebels tells me: “If she offered to go, she would get very close and possibly do it.“It unlocks those people whose self-perception is that they don’t give in to blackmail.” This source continues: “If the DUP move, Jacobmoves,Jacob moves others follow, but you don’t quite get there without the carrot.”Mrs May could leave with dignity, having secured an orderly Brexit and having managed to avoid a split in the Tory party.She wouldn’t need to leave the next day, either.But just in time to ensure that a new Prime Minister had their feet firmly under the desk before a new European Commission comes into office this autumn.One reason why an indication that May will go is so important is that there is assumption she will try to staythe withdrawal agreement passes.One Cabinet minister tells me: “If she gets a deal through, she won’t be able to resist clinging on.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Are you our mum  asked Rex nervously.No, I’m afraid not, I’m Dorothy and I’m here to help you two.You’re about to begin a new chapter in your lives, a very exciting one, and Margaret said I could come and talk to you about where you’d like to go.   Living a lovely le in rural Cornwall with their foster mum, they didn’t understand why they had to leave.But Margaret had just had a baby with a new partner, and now the newborn had arrived, Paul, the father, turned his back on the boys.He’d never been particularly kind to them – he was nothing like sweet Margaret. Choking back tears, the boys were offered three options – boarding school, to work on a pig farm, or a new le at a children’s home in Australia.I loved animals and we’d just been studying Australia at school so it seemed amazing, explained Rex. New le Within weeks the boys were being shipped over to the other side of the world, given suitcases packed full of brand new clothes and told stories of glorious beaches and amazing animals.   A couple who were accompanying us on our flight came to meet us and we were both really excited, explains Rex.When we stopped off at Singapore we realised they hadn’t spoken to us much, but we were too busy playing with our toys.It turned out to be the least of our worries.The second we landed in Tasmania, after taking a small plane from Sydney airport, we saw a couple stood on the tarmac.A skinny lady and a balding well-built man. Harry and Lily.The couple who travelled with us handed us over to them and walked away.It was the last time we ever saw them.I turned to my brother and said, I don’t like them. That’s when the reality of le in Australia started to unravel for the boys. With the scorching sun heating up the car, the brothers took the -mile journey to the care home.Set in sprawling acres of land, the huge stately home looked majestic from the outside.But inside, the living conditions were basic at best.The rooms were dark and dingy, recalls Rex.We were led down a long corridor to our dorm room and were met with hard wooden beds with a thin sheet on top.No home comforts, just a comb each on our bed.We asked for our suitcases because we were excited to wear our new clothes, but instead we were given unorms. We felt alone and scared.  With shower rooms made of concrete , the next morning the boys were woken up for morning exercise. They were to run laps of the garden three times before starting their daily chores.The other boys in the home warned us thatwe stepped out of line we’d be severely beaten, says Rex. The chores ranged from polishing the banisters, cleaning the owner’s room, peeling vegetables for meal times or scrubbing the floors.Slowly I started to hate it and resented their commands, explains Rex. With just support from each other, Rex and Kevin found themselves thrown into the same hellish routine every day.After exercise and chores, they’d walk to school , and get home to finish their duties around the house.Then, the physical violence started. One day while working in the kitchen the phone rang, so without a second thought, I answered it, says Rex.All of a sudden I’m face down on the floor with a searing pain in my chin and blood bursting from my bottom lip. Lily was standing over me screaming at me.  Although both the boys were frightened of le at the home, it was Rex who started to rebel.Rex began to steal money from Harry, which only led to more punishments. One of the worst resulted in a vicious dog bite. Harry called me into his office to punish me for stealing a banknote from his pocket.He started striking me on the head until I fell to the ground.His dog’s jaws sunk into my ankles and I wailed in agony as I tried to kick him off.The last thing I remember was Harry calling to Lily to ask for help clearing up the blood. Physical abuse Rex and his brother felt no love and were constantly exploited.They were bullied at school because of their accents, and any friends they did make they weren’t allowed to socialise with out of school hours as it ate into chore time.Letters arrived regularly but they were never given to the boys.At the weekends they were forced to do additional work – Harry would drive them to a large house owned by two old ladies to work as cleaners. We’d tend the thistles in the garden and injure ourselves on the tools, explains Rex.They’d have us doing all their household chores and when Harry came back for us the ladies would pay him. He was using us for his own financial gain. One thing that Rex did like about Australia was the animals.He’d always been an animal lover and was occasionally allowed to feed and play with the farm animals at the home.But Harry saw this as a way to traumatise Rex once again.About two years after we’d arrived, Harry took me to the aviary and asked me to pick up a goose – I was delighted. I loved cradling the peaceful creature in my arms, feeling the warmth of its feathers.Snap its neck, demanded Harry.I told him I loved the goose and I didn’t want to.The more I protested, the more aggravated he became as he snatched the goose from me, killed it and made me carry its leless body into the kitchen to prepare it for a meal.He called me a coward as tears pricked my eyes.  By the time Rex was , he’d started drinking heavily.Stealing money from wherever he could, he’d frequently run away but was always found. One particularly awful time, Rex tried to escape and hitchhiked with a man who raped him.I hated myself for a long time after that, says Rex solemnly.It made things worse. Hitting rock bottom, Rex’s spiral into alcoholism resulted in a short stay in a young offenders Institute after he was caught stealing.I felt bad for leaving my brother behind, but I would have done anything to be away from Harry and Lily. By , in a detention centre once again, Rex contemplated taking his own le.I thought I’d never see my brother again, I’d never get any qualications, I had nothing to aim for and couldn’t sink any lower.I started drinking weed killer but became overcome with guilt.I stopped myself and spent days in hospital recovering. I just felt so low.  Living with trauma Rex’s upbringing dramatically affected his whole le.He lost touch with Kevin after he ran away from the care home, and ended up living a violent and criminal le. Eventually I realised Australia wasn’t for me, so I headed back to England to search for any remaining family, Rex explains. Working in a metal factory, he saved up enough money for a ticket, and set off to find out more about his past. But the trauma ran deep, and when Rex ed to England, he struggled to connect with any surviving family and fell once again into a spiral of self-destructive behaviour.I felt asI hadn’t achieved anything in my le at all.I blamed the authorities for failing to see how my brother and I were treated and continued rebelling.I ended up in court several times, alcohol plagued my le and with no job or direction, I found myself in a homeless shelter. Eventually, following health problems, Rex knew his lestyle had to change.He started to get his le back on track. Moving into a caravan he became involved in the community, built friendships and tried to put the betrayal he had faced behind him. He met his we, Annie, and ended up back in Cornwall, where intense therapy helped him come to terms with his past.He’s campaigned to the Government about his mistreatment, and slowly but surely, he began to piece together his le.Kevin stayed in Australia, and the brothers are now close again, visiting each other regularly.Rex discovered that their biological mum, Marina, had died  years ago. I don’t hold any resentment towards Mum at all.She wanted us to be adopted – it was the system that failed us.– Read more about Rex’s story in The Last Orphan.

But that’s where the similarities between her and most other British pensioners end. The -year-old has her early morning cuppa in the wilderness of Kenya’s Maasai Mara in the open air as the distant sounds of roaring lions roll across the savannah. She then follows the animals’ calls, driving for miles with her husband Jonathan, , to get up close with the majestic beasts they know inidually like they would their own children. The couple, who live in a tiny thatched one-bedroomed cottage in the middle of the reserve, say they are “living their dream” every day - despite admitting to having a few scary moments with the deadly animals they share their home with.  The zoologists and wildle photographers have been documenting the lives of the Maasai Mara’s lions, leopards and cheetahs for over  years. And now they are back on our TV screens with a new wildle series, Big Cat Tales, shown on the Animal Planet channel this Sunday, allowing us all to get to know their favourite animals, many of which are endangered and dangerously dwindling. The incredible images of lions and their cubs which have enchanted viewers since their first hit series, Big Cat Diary, is a result of their decades forging a mutual relationship with the animals through daily encounters in their natural habitat. The couple go out in dferent safari vehicles, Jonathan in a Land Cruiser and Angie in a Land Rover which has been “customised for ladies” and for her long days out in the wilderness, complete even with a fridge and yoga mat.  Describing her typical day, Angie told : “I wake up at around .am. I lie in bed listening to the sounds, the lions roaring, and longing to get up and get out soon. “At first light or just before I’ll sit out on the plains and have a cup of tea and just listen. “Then by the time we’ve worked out which cat we’re going to find, we take our cars and go.Then we’re out all day, until nightfall. We spend hours with them, taking photos, getting close and trying to create the best images we can. “Our cars become our homes.” But although the couple have seen the prides grow up and have names for each inidual, Jonathan says they would never try to get any closer to the animals, like another couple famous for their friendship with big cats, Born Free’s Joy and George Adamson.  Jonathan says: “We always stay in the cars. The lions are actually frightened of peoplethey see you on foot. “But they definitely get to recognise vehicles that behave nicely with them, and we are always very careful in our approach, very calm. You put out a good energy and they’ll come around. “There’s one beautul picture of Angie in her vehicle, with all of the Marsh Pride who have come to lay in the shadow of her car. That’s how relaxed they are. “It’s not because they know you as friends andyou come out you can have a cuddle with us.It’s that they sense they don’t mean you any harm and they don’t need to worry about you.”  While their tactics mean they have never felt unsafe around the lions, they have had some close calls with other savannah animals - with their most scary moment coming just a few days ago. Johnathan says: “There was a huge bull elephant who came across to our car.Normally they are chilled, but he had been doing a lot of pushing and shoving of other males, and he couldn’t figure out why our car wouldn’t move like they had. “He came over and took one extra step towards the car, doing everything to try to make us move. I think he thought he was going to have to shove us. “He decided to stand tall and put his trunk up, and at one point his tusks were virtually coming through the side of the car. Just a little jab forward and his tusk would have gone straight through Angie’s chest. “In the end I said in a very imposing voice ‘no’ and he took one step backwards which allowed me to gently turn the car on.But it was a spine-tingling moment and a wake up call that whatever we might think, danger is always close by.”  And he remembered another heart-stopping moment, when the pair had picked a quiet spot to get out of their cars and have a rest. He said: We turned round and to our horror we saw there was a hippo coming back to the river, right on track and very close to us. Hippos weigh two to three tonnes and have very large teeth and can do a lot of damage. The scariest thing that has ever happened to them was not in Africa at all, but on a sub-Antarctic island where the couple were filming hooker sea lions. Jonathan said: “We just thought the sea lion would just walk past us, but this one started chasing us.Angie managed to tear a disk in her back. I saw him going flying towards her. “The sea lion actually got beneath the surface of the vegetation as it chased her, and I saw the vegetation just rippling and all the trees collapsing as he ran after her. It was like a scene from the Lord of the Rings.”  The Scotts have committed their lives to raising awareness of Africa’s endangered species since they both found themselves in Kenya in the s. As well as their popular TV series, between them they have also written numerous bestselling books including Jonathan’s ‘The Marsh Lions’ and their co-authored ‘Antarctica: Exploring a Fragile Eden’ and ‘Stars of Big Cat Diary. They are also the only couple to have won, inidually, the Wildle Photographer of the Year Award. But none of that would have happenedJonathan, fresh out of studying zoology at university, had not decided to go on a round the world trip, taking a four-month, pound truck journey from London to Johannesburg in . He intended from there to take a boat to Australia, but after passing through east Africa knew he was meant to stay there.

Sally Thomson, , has been behind the bar of The Highwayman in Sourton, Devon, for more than four decades after her parents Buster and Rita Jones took the helm. The th century inn sees customers both ghastly and fantastic flock to see inside the quirky building, which is nestled on the edge of Dartmoor National Park. Its Tudor-style exterior includes a nod to an old lady who lived in a shoe, a fairy tale pumpkin house, and a fire breathing dragon. And it is even said to home to a ghost named Sam who dresses in green and has a feather in his hat, reports Devon Live.   Sally was only four when her parents acquired the pub. It was a completely new challenge for the family as dad Buster previously ran a crisp factory as well as a sweet one. But it wasnt long before Buster, a boxer, turned the pub into a countrywide talking point - much to the mixed feelings at the time of local residents. “It was quite small and wasn’t what it looks like today, Sally said.It had been modernised by Plymouth Breweries but wasn’t making much money. My father uncovered the original stonework and beams which had been hidden. “They wanted to get people to come here so he started making it look a bit dferent and he got completely carried away. He had a very gothic imagination and used to stockpile artacts.  “They had lots of fun doing it the locals still think we’re potty.” The entrance is a stagecoach which was inspired by the old Launceston to Tavistock coach with two small seating areas either side, and leading to a fascinating journey of discovery because of all the eclectic artacts and objects it has been lovingly filled with. The dimly lit stonework and flagstone-floored burrows and alcoves create a dark, gothic atmosphere where you simply don’t know what to look at first in the Aladdin’s cave of wonder and mystery. A warm welcome comes from behind the odd-shaped bar where owners Sally and husband Bruce are often stood. Together with their trusty dog Monty they provide as much character as their surroundings. Sallys dads creative imagination saw him turn one room into a make-believe galleon. He used parts from an old whaler shipwreck called The Diana, including its intricately carved door.   Inside the room is also where you will find the bust of Nelson which was salvaged from a pub in Plymouth, a ‘sea monster’, a floor of railway sleepers and Rita’s bar, which was named after Sallys glamorous mother. The pub’s two counters are made from part of a tree from local woodland which took men seven hours to cut into two.They were paid in beer and Sally says you can tell which end was the one they cut last because it is a bit ‘squfy’ due to the effects of the alcohol. Among the many usual items you will find in the pub is a ft minotaur, crystal tree, Tutankhamun statue, cartwheels, lanterns, and a bellow acquired from a Devon blacksmith which has been turned into a quirky table by the main bar.On special occasions such as Halloween and Christmas, the pub goes all out with its deacutecor. The building was originally built as an inn in , and later became dual purpose as an inn and a farm because of its  acres at the rear.In the th century it was called the Golden Fleece. Plymouth Breweries later named it the New Inn to give it a more contemporary image. It was then changed beyond all recognition when Buster and Rita bought it in . While Buster was responsible for creating its quirky exterior and interior, it was Rita who changed its name to The Highwayman because she had romantic notions of highwaymen dashing about in the mist on the moor. Sally said: “People would come in out of curiosity which meant they were spending and it gave my father money to do a little bit more to it. They retired in  and Sally has been now been behind the bar for around  years.  “I do enjoy it,” she said. “I like people they can be ghastly but they can also be fantastic. There’s also not many jobs where you get paid to have a drink and a laugh. “I have tried to keep the essence of the pub the same.” A popular change has been the introduction of serving good quality traditional pub food such as pies, pasties, sandwiches and classic dishes such as fish pie. More changes are also on the cards. The ‘boot, once a children’s play area, may be turned it into an art gallery, and Sally is keen to get the water wheel working again. But the biggest change could be when Sally and Bruce press ahead with plans to semi-retire, with the eventual fate of the pub unknown.  In the meantime they will continue to run the pub and the quirky cottage Cobweb Hall opposite the pub.It provides overnight accommodation for visitors who have included comedian Noel Fielding who left a bottle of red wine and a pair of his boxer shorts for Sally, the latter of which she still treasures today. Not all visitors are quite as welcomed as others though. The pub has had many ghostly sightings over the years and although Sally has never witnessed any herself, her mother Rita often spoke of seeing a ghost she christened Sam. She would tell stories of a man dressed in green with a feather in his hat who she believed to be a cavalier from the days when the roundheads and cavaliers battles against each other from the two surrounding villages.  Sally said: “The Galleon used to be old stables so there’s the possibility it could have been someone who was changing the horses for the battle because there’s no reason for a cavalier to be here. “I would have liked the ghost to be highwayman. I wonderI can get the ghost to change costume  “I have never seen any ghosts here, but my mother used to see all sorts. She would even say she saw fairies at the bottom of the garden. “I think the pub has a nice feel. It’s very gothic which is not everyone’s cup of tea, but it was never designed to be sinister. It’s meant to be quite light-hearted. “I like seeing peoples’ reactions when they first come here. I actually don’t mindthey don’t like it.

But sources say Ralph has vowed to reveal his true identity, according to The Daily Star. High Court judges ruled it would be too dangerous to reveal the identity of Jon Venables and how he has been living in recent years as he could become open to vigilante attacks. But a source close to the family say the dad has vowed to continue his fight despite the “severely disheartening” verdict in court.   Speaking to Daily Star Sunday for the first time since the verdict – on would have been James’ th birthday yesterday – a family insider said: “Ralph has lost his son in the worst way possible. What  does he have to lose  “Why wouldn’t he carry on fighting to out him  Apparently Venables has been worrying about being outed. We all think he deserves to be tortured. “If the worry causes him that, then all the better.” The source added of the verdict: “It is sick, that’s what it is.   “Ralph believes Venables lost his right to protection and to live a quiet le when he continued to be evil and twisted into his adult le. “He is a paedophile and a child killer for goodness sake. He will never change and so we will never stop fighting for justice. “It is bizarre. We cannot work out why he is being so well protected. But we won’t stop. We need to wreak havoc and not be silent. “You watch – he will continue to be in and out of the courts on sick charges and we will never know.” Ralph has insisted he does not condone or encourage vigilantism, violence or backlash against Venables. In a statement he said: Ralph has always insisted Venables will remain a danger to children. But he has not vowed to wreak havoc on him or torture Jon Venables. Ralph would like it known on the record this has not come from him and goes against the aims he is trying to achieve of seeking greater protection for children from Jon Venables through legal channels. All that Ralphhave and will continue to do is to take legal steps through the courts where possible. He has no knowledge of this source and has not had any involvement in this article. The murdered toddlers father Ralph and uncle Jimmy launched the bid to have Venabless anonymity removed, arguing certain details about him are common knowledge and easily accessible online. Venables has lived anonymously since his release from a le sentence for the kidnap, torture and murder of two-year-old James in February .  Yesterday James’ mum, who was not involved in the lawsuit, wished her boy happy birthday and tweeted: “Will be spending today thinking of my beautul son James... forever in my heart.” James was killed by Venables and pal Robert Thompson, both then aged , after they snatched him from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside. They were granted lelong anonymity and following their release have lived under new identities. But Venables has been in and out of prison after admitting charges of making indecent images of children – and even admitted to having a “sickening” paedophile manual.

The former Kate Middleton and Prince William, who is Colonel of the Irish Guards, met soldiers from the st Battalion at their base in Hounslow, west London. They led a minute of silence to pay respects to the victims of Fridays terror attack at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Kate wore a long green, military-inspired coat by Alexander McQueen with a Cartier gold shamrock brooch, a matching Lock and Co hat, and heels, while William wore his military unorm. They reunited with their furry friend Domhnall, an Irish wolfhound and mascot they have met several times previously. Kate patted and stroked the dog several times while presenting him with a shamrock.   Sunday mornings parade began with the Last Post, before a minute of silence was observed by the royals, the Irish Guards and their families who stood in memory of the  victims of the New Zealand terror attack. The sun shone as Kate, wearing gloves on a chilly and windy morning that felt like C, handed out baskets of shamrock as William watched close behind in his Irish Guards Frock Coat in the rank of Colonel. After Kate presented the shamrock to officers and warrant officers, three cheers were raised to the royal duo before a march past where William took the salute.   Domhnall, which is Gaelic for world leader, led  soldiers in a march on the Parade Square at Cavalry Barracks. The soldiers families proudly watched on wrapped up warm with blankets to protect from the cold March wind. Drummer David Murray, Domhnalls regimental handler, said the St Patricks Day parade was number one in his calendar and like a second birthday.  The mascot, wearing a red coat, was presented with his first shamrock in . Drummer Murray said: Weve had a week-long preparation as a battalion, weve had a couple of rehearsals, couple of little bits that weve had to obviously fine tune. Domhnall - hes been in the battalion since , hes pretty good at his job... doesnt really need to fine tune much so in regards to me and him its been quite a smooth week.  He added: He helps me through the parade to be honest, he knows what hes doing. Since , when the regiment was first founded by order of Queen Victoria, the regiments parade has traditionally been presided over by a woman. After the parade, William, , and Kate, , were toasted by the longest-serving Guardsman at the Guardsmans Lunch, and the duchess thanked for presenting the shamrock.  At past parades the Duke has sipped on a pint of Guinness in a nod to the tradition of the day. Last year, Kate opted for a sparkling water instead as she was heavily pregnant with Prince Louis, the couples third child. Louis will celebrate his first birthday on April .  Green is the colour of choice for Kate when she attends the annual parade ten miles west of the familys home at Kensington Palace. Three years of ceremonial duties for the Irish Guards came to an end in January. The main focus of the past  months was on exercise Askari Storm, a battlegroup exercise in Kenya. It currently has troops deployed in Uganda, Jordan and Kenya, and training will ramp up in September ahead of missions to South Sudan and Iraq.  Alongside its role serving in British conflicts overseas, the Irish Guards also serve in ceremonial and public duties at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, St Jamess Palace and the Tower of London. Meanwhile, Meghan Markle has reportedly completed her final public royal engagements before going on maternity leave. The Duchess of Sussex is due to give birth to her and Prince Harrys first child in just a few weeks. Last Monday, Meghan and Harry joined Kate and William and the rest of the royal family for a Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. When Meghan arrived she greeted Kate with a kiss on both cheeks, a move that poured cold water on allegations of a feud.

Time is running out for incompetent Theresa May and with Parliament paralysed, Brexit isn’t happening a week on Friday. Yet I’ll be honest and admit I don’t know what happens after that or even later this week when unpredictable events shape the country’s destiny for decades to come. Nobody does – including May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, as well as our neighbours. The stumbling PM and Tory hardline Brextremists DUP reactionaries have gted the EU unprecedented momentary power over Britain.   We could be in Europe for another three months or two years. We might stay for ever or be shykamikazes crashing out without a deal. May is hoping sufficient revolting Tories, DUP fundamentalists and Labour faint-hearts swallow their pride and principles to finally endorse her twice-rejected plan tomorrow. Irrelevance and insularity for a poorer and weaker Britain, and other workers’ jobs, are a price these shycharlatans are shamefully prepared to pay for an easier le. My preference is for a People’s Vote to let us, the electorate, be judge and jury on the real choice after the lies of three years ago under a previous Prime Minister in an earlier Parliament.   Democracy is the answer to shyshyWestminster’s deadlock but Brextremists justiably suspect the poundmillion-a-week question in  would result in a decision to remain in Europe. Corbyn is supporting a another referendum – though keeping open the door to vote leave – as proposed by Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle. But the signs are the House of Commons doesn’t want a second poll. So Groundhog May is sticking to her mulish game of Brexit blackmail. National interest is buried by the self-interest of an enfeebled Tory leader determined it is her way or no way. When history is written, it will be harsh on May.

Steven Elsender, , was already banned when he crashed his Ford into a Seat Ibiza four days before Christmas. But the smash on Egerton Street in Newcastle upon Tyne was spotted by the Seat owners husband after he heard a thud. Police spoke with Elsender, who admitted driving the Ford at the time of the smash. But his solicitor claimed he was just trying to do the right thing after it ran out of petrol when his we was driving - only for an irate motorist to start moving towards them.  Elsenders solicitor said: She tries to get it off the road but fails abysmally. It starts to roll backwards - a Golf comes around the corner and the driver starts remonstrating with his we. Those remonstrations include claims the Golf driver shouted at the couple and even kicked their car. So Elsender, of West Road, jumped in the drivers seat, only to crash the car.  At North Tyneside Magistrates Court, Elsender admitted driving without a valid licence or insurance. The court heard how he was only a week away from sitting an advanced test in a bid to get his licence back. But he admitted he had no L plates on that day and despite thinking he was insured, he wasnt. In mitigation, it was said Elsender had only driven a matter of feet.  But the court heard he has  convictions to his name, while prosecutor Lee Poppett said: Theres no less than seven driving while disqualied offences. However a hearing is scheduled for April , which the defendant requested in a bid to avoid a fresh ban. The hearing involves both the prosecution and defence debating contested points of evidence before a judge, and can influence the sentence ultimately imposed.

In a letter to MS suppliers, food MD Stuart Machin said the move would help the firm compete with Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Tesco as a destination for families doing their weekly shop. It comes as the Mirror High Street Fightback campaign seeks to revive dwindling town centres. The Mirror is demanding a fund to revitalise high streets, better public transport into towns and an end to rip-off parking charges. We also want a new tax on online sales, a review of planning laws and council powers for neglected sites, and rate relief for firms that take empty stores. As well as introducing new branches, some existing MS stores will be revamped with areas selling clothes converted to food.   The letter reportedly said: “We are starting a store renewal programme that will get more products in front of customers with bigger, better MS food halls in new and existing sites.It is assumed that MS Food isn’t a full-range business. “That is not true. Our full range is unrivalled in taste and quality. We have over , lines... we just don’t get them in front of customers.   “Our full range is only available in a dozen or so stores. This must change and it will.” Mr Machin also said the plans are designed to “bust” the “misunderstanding” MS is only for “singles and couples”.

Hyundai has created the ‘Digital Key’ which uses Near Field Communication to allow a phone and car to talk to each other when in close proximity. After the smartphone unlocks the vehicle, the driver starts the engine by placing the device on the wireless charging pad in the centre console and pressing an engine Start Stop button on the dashboard. The app can be used by up to four authorised people which save each person’s preferred driving settings. Once the phone and car mate-up, the position of the mirrors, seats and steering wheel will adjust automatically depending on the user’s requirements.   And by using Bluetooth Low Energy communication, the Hyundai Digital Key can also lock and unlock the vehicle, activate the alarm and start the engine remotely. The level of access to dferent vehicle s can be tailored to each user, for a defined period. Hyundai has developed the technology with car sharing schemes in mind - but it could also be used to enable a courier to open the boot to deliver a parcel. As car sharing becomes more widespread around the world, the Digital Key will be programmed to make peer-to-peer vehicle rental easier. The owner and the driver won’t have to meet but can transfer the Digital Key via the smartphone app. The Digital Key will also have features such as an alert which can be triggeredthe person renting the Hyundai exceeds the speed limit or drives outside an agreed area.   Ho Yoo, group leader of Hyundai Motor Group’s Electronics Development Group, said: “The Digital Key will benefit a very wide range of future Hyundai customers, as well as enabling innovative new schemes for vehicle sharing. “We are studying other ways to harness this type of connected-car technology to greatly enhance the driving and ownership experience.” Hyundai has said it aims to gradually implement the technology in its new production cars. It follows the manufacturer’s development of smart fingerprint technology that allows drivers to unlock doors and start the vehicle. To unlock the car, the driver places a finger on the sensor located on the door handle. The encrypted fingerprint information will be identied and delivered to the fingerprint controller inside the vehicle. The technology’s chance of incorrectly recognising another person’s fingerprint as the driver’s is one in , - making it five times more effective than conventional vehicle keys, including smart keys.

Darren Thomson, , lost all feeling in the left side of his body just  minutes after he developed a blinding headache. The Hibernian FCfan was rushed to hospital where scans revealed he had suffered a stroke and had a bleed on the brain caused by a blood clot the size of a p coin, Daily Record reports. He had two operations to help drain the excess fluid in his brain, but he still couldnt speak for three months due to a tube down his throat and then brain damage.   Darren heard his nurses talking about how they supported Scottish Premier League rival team Hearts FC - and shocked them by blurting out his first words: Hearts are s****. And five months since his first words the young mans speech is getting better every day. Hes still in a wheelchair but hoping to be on his feet to be his dads best man at his wedding later this year. Darren said: It was so scary not being able to speak. Its so hard to put into words what its like not being able to speak. I was so confused, I didnt even know what was happening or anything. But when I had a Hearts doctor looking after me, someone had said whats Hearts and I just said Hearts are s**t. It just came to me, I was so happy that I spoke out, everyone laughed. It felt so good to just hear my own voice again.   Darren was at home on June  last year watching YouTube videos with his friend when he started to feel a headache at the back and right side of his head. The Hibs fan thought nothing of it until minutes later when he couldnt feel the left side of his body. His friend, Michael Alison, , lted up Darrens left arm but when he let it go it fell to his side. He called Darrens dad Phil, , who rushed to the scene and took Darren to Borders General Hospital where medics discovered he had suffered a stroke and had severe bleeding in his brain. He was transferred to the Edinburgh Western General were medics drained the cerebrospinal fluid - a clear and colourless body fluid found in the brain and spinal cord.   Phil, from Galashiels, Scottish Borders, said medics did not think he would make it. He said: His face had not dropped and he didnt have slurred speech. I was just confused about what was actually happening because he was also struggling to stand up. Thats why I ended up taking him to the local hospital. But when he was finally rushed to the Edinburgh Western General Hospital no one knewhe would make it and even medics didnt have faith in the operation going well. It was so frightening to hear all of these negative thoughts. After the operation, Darren was put into intensive care with a le support machine for around  weeks.   He was taken off le support but needed a second operation to fix the tubes in his brain that would help his body drain the excess fluid naturally. This is becausethe fluid builds up in the brain it could put pressure on the brain, which can damage it. He went under the kne again in August and a few weeks after the operation the tube running down his throat was removed. But he still couldnt speak due to the brain damage. He was then transferred to the stroke ward at the Borders General Hospital in October. This is where Darren shocked nurses when he said his first words after the two operations. Phil explained: He made a funny comment about how terrible Hearts were. This was because most of the nurses there were all Hearts fans. We all couldnt believe it, I just laughed.   He was there for five weeks before he ed home in early December last year. Darren uses a wheelchair and requires a carer  , but said he remains positive due to his dads support. Darren said: My dads been unreal. I just thinkit wasnt for him I wouldnt be here today. I thank him so much for everything he has done. Phil, who is Darrens full-time carer, said his son hopes he will be able to walk again for his wedding on June . He said: Its dficult being a full-time carer but Im a positive person. He does get frustrated when he cant go out and see his friends but his brilliant, he doesnt get down. He wants to stand at my wedding so well see.

They provide essentials like bread and milk that some of us take for granted. Coventry Foodbank is one of the largest in the UK and handed out more than , emergency food packages to people in the city during   - more than  every day. And even more worryingly, , of those went to families with children who would have otherwise gone hungry. Coventry Live chief reporter Katy Hallam decided to live off the same package handed out to people in the city. She also discovered what le is really like when you have no food in the fridge and the cupboards are bare. Here Katy reveals how she go on... Whats in the parcel   The following is what a single person is given as an emergency food supply for three days. The items will y because  per cent of the food is donated by the public.A small box of cereal Two cans of soup Two cans of beans or spaghetti Two cans of tomatoes or pasta sauce Two cans of vegetables Two cans of meat Two small pieces of fruit One can of rice pudding or custard A small packet of biscuits g of pasta, rice or noodles Tea coffee -  bags or a small jar One litre of long-le juice One litre of UHT milkI chose to do my shop at Tesco, as the supermarket has the most drop-off points for the foodbank in Coventry. Day One   I wasnt much looking forward to breakfast on day one of my foodbank challenge - oats and UHT milk. I have to confess Ive never actually eaten oats before and I doubt I will again. They were pretty flavourless. The main thing is they did the job of keeping me full until lunchtime which is the most important thing. And at least I had orange juice to wash them down. By the time Id finished my vegetable soup and lonely apple for lunch, I was still hungry.   Despite cups of tea to fill me up, my stomach was rumbling as I drove home from work. After my lunch, I was getting quietly confident that this challenge wouldnt be as bad as I thought. My first evening meal was an unappealing concoction of pasta, chopped tomatoes and fried spam. I even had to wash out my frying pan and start again when I realised I shouldnt have used oil! The finished product looked bad and tasted worse, so I used up my rice pudding on my first night to take the taste away. I went to bed miserably awaiting my breakfast the next morning. Day Two   I almost considered skipping breakfast completely because I really wasnt looking forward to my second morning of oats and UHT milk. But I knew that without them, Id really struggle to get through my day at work. If Id had some sugar, le would have been a million times better. The only plus was, again, the glass of orange juice afterwards that washed away the taste of the oats. Day twos lunch consisted of a can of chicken and mushroom soup .  Youre probably noticing quite a lot of repetition already - and this was the hardest part of the challenge, not the low quality of the food. My body was craving something - anything - dferent. And by this point the sugar craving had really kicked in. I dont normally drink fizzy drinks but suddenly I had the biggest thirst for Coca-Cola. After yesterdays spam concoction, I wasnt in a rush to make my dinner - even though I was really hungry. But I soon gave in to the pangs and poured out my pasta. This time, I added some sweetcorn and corned beef and mixed away.   This was probably my lowest point of the whole challenge. Corned beef looks like dog food and although Ive never eaten pet food I imagine it tastes worse, especially when its all mushed up into a big pink goo. I also realised that Id nearly made it to the age of  without knowing what the little stick on the top of the corned beef tin is for . Day Three  One good thing about my disastrous dinner the night before was that I was actually quite looking forward to my bland, tasteless oats. Or I was until I realised I had about a tablespoon of UHT milk left. There was nothing to do but add water to the tiny amount of milk. This was not setting me up for a good final day of the challenge. By day three, Id already consumed my two cans of soup and two apples. What was I going to do for lunch  I still had pasta, so I decided to split that between lunch and dinner.  I added in a tin of beans, and the leftover spam I had thankfully saved from day one. It sounds awful, but it was actually my favourite meal of the challenge! Things were looking up... By now, I fear I was starting to look a bit like a piece of penne pasta. But when you have no choice, youre grateful for what youve got so I was quite happy to dig into the carbs again after a fairly successful lunch.  And then I started making dinner. Even though I had no meat left, after my corned beef disaster I wasnt going to add any anyway. So I used my tin of peas and some of the leftover chopped tomatoes to bulk out my pasta. I think looking back this would have been the better option throughout! The tinned meat probably would have been better cold and as a side dish. Overall The food might not have been exciting but I was so relieved I had something to come home to. I struggled with concentration even after my first day on my minimal diet and when I worked out my calories at around  a dayI wasnt surprisied. The foodbank parcel isnt meant to be a long-term solution and relies on the goodwill of the public - more than  per cent of donations come from you. Its more than a shame that we even have the need for them in this country but they do an amazing job of getting you through those dire moments. The parcel tries to include a range of the dferent vitamins and minerals you need, albeit in a simple way. A lot of people were surprised the package included biscuits, but there were just four a day to spread over the challenge and I think I genuinely might have cracked without a tiny bit of sugar - especially after a depressing dinner. Coventry Live paid for the food received."},{"url":null,"title":"young couple buy crumbling 120","story":"NewsYoung couple buy crumbling -year-old mansion by MISTAKE after auction mix-upCal Hunter and Claire Segeren were hoping to purchase an apartment in Glasgow - but they ended up paying £, for the wrong propertyShareCommentsByHeather Greenaway:,  MAR NewsCal Hunter and Claire Segeren \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young couple accidentally bought a derelict -year-old mansion instead of a two-bedroom flat following a massive auction mix-up. Cal Hunter and Claire Segeren were hoping to purchase an apartment in Glasgow - however they ended up paying pound, for the wrong property due to a mix-up with lot numbers. Cal attended the auction while Claire was in Canada - however he didnt realise the property before the flat he hoped to buy was being sold in three lots instead of one, so put he his bid in too soon. However the pair have dubbed the mix-up a beautul mistake as, despite the rotten timbers and leaking roof, they both fell in love with the Jameswood Villa. Instead of following experts advice of tearing the house down and starting from scratch - Cal and Claire plan on completely refurbishing the building, which is in Dunoon, Scotland. They want to turn it into three apartments - two of which they will sell to pay back debts, Daily Record reports.   Cal, , from Hull, said: We love the house and its stunning location in a village on the edge of a Scottish loch. It’s all been a beautul mistake. If we can tackle this, we can tackle anything – it’s going to take us much longer than a year but just think of the le skills we are going to learn along the way. The cash-strapped couple have moved into a small caravan in the garden so they clear the house and give it a huge makeover. Claire, who is from Toronto, Canada, said: Discovering we had bought a massive derelict house that had been abandoned for  years and not a two-bedroom apartment did come as a bit of a shock.   “We had seen a flat we really liked in Pollokshields on the south side of Glasgow. It had been fire-damaged but we reckoned it would only take six months to fix up. Cal went to the auction and didn’t realise the house before ours was being sold in three lots instead of one so he put his hand up and bid too soon. “When he realised what he had done, he panicked and left the auction to ring me in Canada and tell me he had just bought the wrong house.We had only paid pound, for the property so my dad, who I was with when I took the call, said, ‘What’s the worst that could happen ’ So Cal was dispatched to take a look. “Neither of us are from Scotland so we had to look up Dunoon on the map and we were both relieved to see it wasn’t that far from Glasgow. “But our relief turned to despair when Cal pulled up outside the house and saw it for the first time. “It was in a state of partial collapse, it was subsiding, there were gaping holes in the roof and walls, the timbers were rotten and the land was waterlogged. Derelict was too mild a word.” Despite the shock, they decided to take it on. Claire said: “The house was built in  and had a lovely feel to it and so much character that we felt it would be a sin to level it and start again. So we made the momentous decision to give it a go. “I had planned to do medicine at Glasgow University but, as I couldn’t afford the increased fees for international students, we decided we would take a year out, buy a property and do it up to sell. “A full-blown restoration wasn’t exactly what we had in mind but we’ve started it now and are determined to see it through. “We are doing as much of the work as we can by ourselves with help from our friends but there are some jobs that are proving just too big. I’m at the house full-time and Cal works every spare minute he has between the carpentry jobs he is doing to fund the renovations.”  The couple started work on the property last November - however finding new problems is a daily occurrence. Cal said: “Finding a new problem seems to be a daily occurrence here at Jameswood. It has taken us until now to find the electricity cable that will allow us to connect to the mains. Our van was getting stuck in the mud so we put down a driveway which we had to dig up a week later to find the elusive water supply. The house needs a new roof but a civil engineer has told us the walls probably won’t be strong enough to hold it up so we will have to fix them first and risk the rain coming through the roof ruining them. It’s like a huge catch- jigsaw puzzle. “You would think all this would put us off but it hasn’t. “We started off living in our Transit van before moving to a caravan with no running water or electricity. Our neighbours have been letting us use their shower and their oven as we only have a gas stove and have been surviving by candlelight. “We have been overwhelmed by the kindness of the people of Dunoon. They think we are lunatics taking on such a big project but they have been offering us lots of encouragement and support. “Many have got in touch with us through our blog ‘WhathaveweDunoon ’ and have given us technical advice or pointed us in the direction of old building supplies that are going spare.”  Claire said: “This project is not only good for garnering a host of skills, it is also a good way of testing our relationship. If we can survive living in a tiny caravan on a building site, we can survive anything. There is light at the end of the tunnel – it’s a long way off but it is there.” Cal added: If everything goes to plan, we will be mortgage-free while still in our s, which would be a great achievement… but who knows  “We may have bought the wrong house but, to us, it was a happy accident – one which we are embracing rather than despairing over.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum gives birth six babies","story":"NewsMum gives birth to SIX babies in just nine minutes defying  in . billion oddsThelma Chiaka gave birth to two sets of twin boys and one set of twin girls at a hospital in Houston, TexasShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsMum Thelma Chiaka with family member Ebere Ofor, Dr Ziad Haidar and Dr Israel Simchowitz \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum gave birth to six babies - four boys and two girls - in just nine minutes, defying astonishing odds of one in . billion.

Of course, we all put the best possible version of ourselves out there on the likes of Tinder, but one mans suspicions that hed been deceived turned out to be true - in the most unexpected and bizarre way.Im on Tinder and I see a cute chick so I swipe right, the man explains on Reddit.  In two of her pics its clear she has a twin. Cool. Not identical, but close enough. They were both above the shoulder shots. We start talking and shes ramping up to be perfect, you know how crushes are yadda yadda. The pair quickly arranged their first date, with the man getting there early and waiting outside.[...] she shows up much larger than in her pics, but shes still cute and Im not a picky man. I figured that the pictures shed used were from last year and thats fine. Not all my pics are recent either, I just threw up my best.The date was actually awesome. The crush is still strong even as Im typing it but...  Something made the man suspicious. Not just the photos of her twin, but also how his date talked about her. He explained: Nothing bad, just... dismissive  I dont know how to describe it. So he decided to do a little digging. I check Facebook and the pictures she had used were from her sisters profile . And Im not sure how to feel now. On one hand, I like her. On the other, shes using her sisters pics to get dates and thats... weird  But theyre twins so she legit would look just like her sisshe lost a bit of weight so its not really lying    And I get why she did it, we all got flaws we wanna pretend arent there, but     Confused, the man turned to his colleagues to askhe should go on a second date, and they were ided on the issue. One thought he was fat-shaming and lacking in empathy. As for the response to his post, they all seemed to think he was being fair.  One read: You are under no obligation to go on a second date. Period. Plus, she lied, and hid it. So, don’t fall into that type of relationship where it’s already based off lies. Good luck. Though based on the fact the man actually seemed to like his date, others urged him to give it a chance. The end result is that you got catfished. Doesnt really matter that its her twin, shes using pictures of someone that isnt her to get dates. However, I also think you should at least see where it goes  If you really like this girl then I think its worth seeing where this goes.  As it turns out, there isnt going to be a second date. The man later wrote: I ended up texting her after work: Hey I went to add you on Facebook and your sisters profile popped up. Whats going on  with a screenshot of her sisters profileAaaaaand she blocked me. Without explaining anything. So I guess that decides that.

Her mother Rosemarie hastily filed a missing persons report, while her father Josef thanked concerned friends for their sympathy and support. As weeks went by with no word from her, everybody started to fear the worst. Then out of nowhere a letter arrived from Elisabeth, claiming she had grown tired of living with them in their house in Amstetten, Austria, and decided to run away. Josef told police he had no idea where she had gone, but that she had likely joined a religious cult, something she had talked about doing before.   But the apparently concerned, middle-class father, a respectable salesman and good family man, knew exactly where his daughter was - and it just a few feet below where the officers were standing. Only  years later would anyone discover the truth - that Fritzl had imprisoned his daughter inside the dirt-walled cellar underneath this home. He raped her almost daily and where, surviving depravity and cruelty in squalid darkness, she gave birth to seven children, one of whom died. His crimes were so terrible that, even today, their retelling still has the power to profoundly shock. Just under a year after Elisabeth was finally rescued, aged , Fritzl got a taste of le under lock and key himself when he was sentenced to le on his th birthday -  years ago on Tuesday. In fact Elisabeth’s nightmare began years before her father tricked her into going downstairs to the hidden cellar underneath their house at  Ybbsstrasse, when he started sexually abusing her from the age of .   Frizl, who admitted raping his daughter more than , times, would later say: “I knew that Elisabeth did not want the things I did to her. I knew that I was hurting her. But the urge to finally be able to taste the forbidden fruit was too strong.” After finishing school aged  she started a course to become a waitress but before she had finished ran away from home and went into hiding in Vienna with a friend. She was found by police three weeks later and ed home, where she rejoined and completed the course and was offered a job in the nearby city of Linz. It was her chance to finally get away from her abusive dad and have a new start in le - but Josef had other ideas. For the last three years he had secretly been turning the cellar into a prison cell. On August , , Josef called his daughter to the basement, asking her to help carry the new door which would complete his renovations.  There, he knocked her unconscious with an ether-soaked towel before dragging her into the cramped, windowless cellar hidden behind shelving in his workshop, that was to be her prison for the next  years. And as, over the next few years, the police investigation into her whereabouts ran cold and was filed away, Elisabeth found herself at the mercy of her evil, merciless father. To the outside world, Josef was the smartly-dressed engineer who drove a Mercedes, had a number of other properties, and worked hard to provide for his we Rosemarie and their seven children. But in the dark subterranean world where Elisabeth was trapped, he was a depraved monster. The level of depravity and suffering Elizabeth was forced to endure in the dungeon - just metres underneath her oblivious mother - is dficult to comprehend.  At first tied up or shackled to an iron pipe, for , terror-filled days and nights her father repeatedly visited the cellar to rape her and often punished her by leaving her without food or electricity, sometimes leaving her in complete darkness for up to  days at a time. For the first nine years Fritzl, now , did not utter a single word. In later years he raped her in front of the three children he had imprisoned alongside her and forced her to watch pornographic videos, which he made her reenact with him while her children watched on. At his trial prosecutor Christiane Burkheiser told a jury: He tied her up and then the next day he secured her by tying a leash around her waist that further limited her movement. This was an  square metre room, the same size as the jury bench where you are sitting. She had a small basin, no bath, no shower, often no heat. He would come, switch the lights off, rape her, leave.  There was nothing there to make her le more bearable. There was no daylight. He would turn down the lights when he came down, attacking her in front of their little children. She added: There was no communication between him and her during the first few years when he raped her. He attacked, left and said nothing. The worst thing for Elisabeth was not the rapes themselves, nor the appalling conditions. “It was the uncertainty. How long would he stay  When would he come back once he had gone  Would he come back at all after he left her for his holidays  She was always wonderingshe was ever going to get out of there alive. She was a broken person. He was the absolute ruler. He had complete control. He decided what would be eaten, what medicines would be allowed downstairs, who could leave and when. “The electricity was switched off for hours at a time, sometimes deliberately, sometimes due to a power cut that he would not repair.  She spent up to  days at a time in complete darkness. In the winter it was bitingly cold, in the summer it was blisteringly hot. You had to wipe the moisture from the walls. There was no torch, no candles, no warm food. Even when she had babies to take care of the electricity would go off. Two years into her captivity, Elisabeth became pregnant, though she miscarried  weeks later. Two years later, however, she fell pregnant again, and this time gave birth in August  to a baby girl called Kerstin. Two years later, another baby was born, a boy named Stefan. But Fritzl refused to allow her to leave the dungeon to give birth, instead just giving her a book on childbirth and a box of aspirins for the pain. When Elizabeth gave birth it was in a damp cellar on a dirty blanket. She never had any proper medical attention, just aspirin or cough medicine.  She was expected to fend for herself even through childbirth,” said prosecutor Mrs Burkheiser. Over the next  years, Elisabeth would give birth to five more children. One more was allowed to remain in the basement with her, one died shortly after birth, and the other three were taken upstairs to live with their grandparents. In order to conceal what he was doing from Rosemarie, Fritzl staged elaborate discoveries of the children, often placing them on bushes near the home or on the doorstep, along with a note written by Elisabeth claiming she couldn’t take care of the baby and was leaving it with her parents. Social services never questioned the appearance of the children and allowed the Fritzls to keep them as their own children. Despite the horric circumstances, Elisabeth cared for her children who stayed with her, Kerstin, Stefan and Felix, and tried to teach them with the rudimentary education she herself had. In this damp, fetid prison the children who were weakened by lack of oxygen and who had never seen daylight were assured by their mother: “Heaven is up there.”  The ceiling of the cellar was just ft from the ground, meaning that Elisabeth and her children, who were between six and  when they were rescued, spent their days either crouching or lying down. In  Fritzl agreed to Elisabeth’s repeated requests to enlarge the prison by an extra  squared metres, putting her and her children to work for years digging out soil with their bare hands. Elisabeth later said she and her children were too terried to try to escape because her father had told her the heavy concrete and steel door, opened using a remote-control combination lock, was booby-trapped. He told Elisabeth there was a light trigger which would either electrocute her or gas her, killing everyone in the cellar. In addition there were three locked doors and she never tried to get out of them,” Mrs Burkheiser said. It is not known how long Fritzl intended to keep his daughter and her three children, who had never seen the outside world or even breathed its air, captive in the basement.  But in  her eldest child Kerstin became critically ill, from what was later believed to be kidney failure. Elisabeth begged her father to allow the -year-old to get medical attention and when she eventually became unconscious in the early hours of the morning of April  , he let Elisabeth help him carry Kirsten out of the dungeon and called an ambulance. He claimed that he had found the girl leaning against the wall of his house, clutching a note from her cult member mother Elisabeth. When doctors were unable to diagnose the cause of Kerstin’s illness they put out a public plea in the media for Elisabeth to come forward. Unluckily for Fritzl, Austrian TV picked up on the case, portraying him as a man in despair as he tried to find Kerstin’s mother in time to get the information needed to save the -year-old’s le. As his lies collapsed in on him, he took the enormous gamble of taking Elisabeth to the hospital.  But police, tipped off by doctors suspicious at the signs of neglect they saw in the sick teenager, were waiting for them on the grounds of at least charging the mother with child cruelty. Elisabeth was at first reluctant to talk and only opened up when the police officers promised her she would never have to see her father again. She began with the words: “No-one will believe me.” It took Elisabeth two hours to give the officers the basic details of what she had suffered as she told a story which would soon shock the world and make Josef Fritzl’s name synonymous with pure evil. Fritzl himself never showed any remorse, insisting during an interview in prison “it’s normal to have a family in the cellar.

And on Sunday the anniversary will be commemorated at the scene of the breakout in Zagan, western Poland. On the moonless night of March , ,  allied aircrew got away from Stalag Luft III prison camp wearing civilian clothes or German unorms and carrying forged papers. Tragically, all but three were recaptured and  of them were executed by the Nazis. The th man to break out was Squadron Leader Leonard Henry Trent VC, who was caught in the act and surrendered. Unlike so many, he lived to tell the tale and died in his native New Zealand in , aged .  He will be among those remembered at the anniversary event, which will include a flypast by four Polish Air Force F- fighters and an RAF Airbus AM transporter plane. A special roll-call of the escapees will be attended by diplomats, military delegates and family members. The true story of the Great Escape is just as remarkable as that in the film, which turned Steve McQueen into the coolest motorcyclist of all time. However, unlike in the movie depiction, no American PoWs took part. The plan was put together by RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, known as “Big X” – depicted by Richard Attenborough’s Roger Bartlett in the film. Stalag Luft III was meant to be escape-proof, but Bushell simply saw it as a challenge and planned three tunnels to get  men out. He told inmates: “The only reason that God allowed us this extra ration of le is so we can make le hell for the Hun.”  Bushell believed three tunnels, Tom, Dick and Harry, were the perfect cover as the Germans would never suspect there were two moreone was discovered. More than  prisoners were involved in their construction, ft below the surface, with chambers created to house an air pump, a workshop and staging posts. Sandy subsoil was held up with , bed boards. Milk cans were converted into digging tools, candle holders and ventilation ducts. Pumps were built from hockey sticks and kit bags. Electric lighting was hooked into the camp grid. Tunnellers moved  tons of sand over  months. Small pouches, made of old socks, were attached inside PoWs’ trousers, with sand scattered and mixed in with top soil as they walked around the yards. Friendly guards supplied railway timetables, maps and official papers used for forgeries.   Genuine civilian clothes were obtained by bribing German staff. The prisoners eventually broke out through Harry after Tom was found and destroyed, while Dick was abandoned. Seventeen men were ed to Stalag Luft III. Four were sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where they managed to tunnel out and escape three months later before being recaptured. Two were sent to Colditz. Last month, the final surviving member of the Great Escape team, former squadron leader Dick Churchill. died aged . Robert Ankerson, of Royal Air Forces Ex-Prisoners of War Association, of which Churchill was a member, said: “It was always a pleasure to speak to him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"revealing photo exhausted multitasking mum","story":"NewsRevealing photo of exhausted multitasking mum has struck a serious chord with parentsSeveral details in the photo have got people talkingShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsJazmyne with her family \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJazmyne Futrell is a mum-of-four whose recent photo of family le has captured a lot of peoples attention.

I’d played in the friendlies and was mixing with the boys really well. We’ve got a good bunch of lads here so that’s really helped at what already is a great club.“Sometimes it’s a risk taking a gamble on somebody who’s taken a bit of time out of the game.“I’m just happy to be back playing and training and, most importantly, I’m enjoying it again.“A break is needed sometimes, maybe so you can see how much you miss playing or even the buzz in and about the dressing-room and, most importantly, how much you love it.“When you’re playing full time and when you’re playing for so long, you kind of take it for granted.“You become immersed in it and you realise how dependent you are on the game as it’s always going to be there.“It’s when you take that step back it really hits home how much you need it in your le, that what’s happened in my case.“You just need to play for as long as you can and enjoy it for as long as you can, or until, unfortunately, your body gives up on you.“I’ve always been the type of person who wants to win every game and every duel –you’re playing football and you don’t want to play and win every game then you’re most likely in the wrong profession.“I’ve still got that hunger that I’ve took everywhere with me, it’s just the type of person I am.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pavol safranko call up is crucial county clash blow for dundee united","story":"Dundee United have been dealt a blow after striker Pavol Safranko was named in the Slovakia squad for their opening European Championship qualiers.While his inclusion reflects his fine form since joining the Tangerines on loan from Danes Aalborg last August, it means he will miss two important Championship fixtures.The Tangerines face leaders Ross County at Tannadice on Tuesday night in what is a must-win gamethey are to retain even a slim chance of catching the Staggies in the race for automatic promotion.By then, though, the -year-old will be back in his homeland preparing for a qualier against Hungary that takes place a week tonight.He will also miss the Tannadice clash with Alloa on Saturday week because the Slovakians are away to Wales the following afternoon.Ironically Safranko’s call-up comes after he was dropped to the bench for last weekend’s defeat at Partick Thistle – the first time since his arrival he’s not started a game for which he’s been available.He did end up playing for most of the proceedings at Firhill after Osman Sow picked up an injury and had to be replaced with just  minutes on the clock.Safranko’s arrival couldn’t prevent United going down - to the Jags but his goals this term have had a major impact.His  goals in  appearances in tangerine to date have made him joint-top scorer alongside Nicky Clark.Safranko’s work rate during games has also seen him repeatedly praised by boss Robbie Neilson.And while United are delighted his form for them has seen him rewarded with an international recall – he already has two caps to his name – the timing could have been better.They’ll be hoping Sow recovers from a calf problem that’s dogged him since his January arrival from MK Dons in time for Saturday’s trip to Dunfermline.Even more vital will be having the Swede in the squad for next week’s two games when Safranko will be missing.The striker is not the only United man to be recognised at international level this week.Teenager Mati Zata will also be on his travels next week after being called up by Zimbabwe.He’s in their squad for the U  AFCON qualying double header against Mozambique, with the games taking place on March  and .The -year-old was recently loaned out to local juniors Tayport to give him game time.Midfielder Zata joined United after a spell at Rangers just over a year ago.He’s had first-team experience in the Irn-Bru Cup this season.Zata has dual nationality and has also represented Scotland at U  level.

We can beat them in both of those games, we know we’re capable of that but we’d need to win all the other games as well.“What’s important is that we go on a winning run because that’s a massive thing going into the end of the season, whether you’re going for automatic promotion oryou are going to be in the play-offs.”The -year-old’s experience of the second tier tells him how dficult that’s going to be and,anything, he believes putting together a winning run this term is harder than it’s ever been.“I think when you look at the league right now you see that any time you’re playing, there is no guaranteed games you are going to win.“Everyone in the league has something to play for, whether it’s the teams up at the top or the ones down at the bottom.“I think this is one of the tightest seasons I’ve seen for a few years.”That view is backed up by the progress of today’s opponents.Until a five-game winning streak, the Pars were looking over their shoulders and worrying about being dragged into a relegation dogfight.Now they’re in a play-off spot and,they can make it six wins on the trot today, they’d be challenging United in the race for second place.That makes this game almost as vital as the looming clash with Ross County at Tannadice on Tuesday.Stanton knows he and his team-mates will have their work cut out today but stressed the aim is to maintain an unbeaten East End Park record that stretches back to .“As a club we’ve had a good record against Dunfermline and we want to keep that going.“They are on a good run right now but we believe we can go there and win.“If we do win this one we keep a gap to the teams below us.“That’s important but we just have to look to be winning games as often as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"craigholme-school-glasgow-girls-school-to-close-over-dwindling-pupil-numbers","story":"A GLASGOW school ndash one of the last private girlsrsquo secondaries in Scotland ndash is set to close as a result of falling pupil numbers."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

They were shocked - by Hamilton in their last Granite City league outing.The Reds last two games # a - draw with Celtic in the league at Parkhead and Tuesday#s brilliant - win in the Scottish Cup quarter-final replay against Rangers at Ibrox # had given cause for optimism their remarkable away form might finally transfer to Pittodrie.However, they will go into the international break on the back of seven home matches without victory after Niall McGinn#s first half volley was cancelled out by the Lions# Craig Sibbald. They remain third in the table.Mikey Devlin partnered Scott McKenna at centre-back in Andy Considine’s absence, while – with Sam Cosgrove ing from the suspension which saw him miss Ibrox and Stevie May pushed back – youngster Dean Cambell dropped out.The Lions were without a win against the Reds since  and were looking for just their third win since the turn of the year.Dom Ball had a glorious chance from a Niall McGinn corner on two minutes, somehow failing to connect with his header completely.Soon after, McGinn’s poked ball into the area was hit by skipper Graeme Shinnie, with Liam Kelly making a low stop.The next part of the game was scrappy, with Aberdeen launching long balls forward for May to chase – to no avail.On  minutes, McKenna headed another McGinn delivery high and wide of the target after Shinnie had been felled by Steve Lawson  yards from goal.It was McGinn and fellow Ibrox hero McLennan who combined for the opener six minutes later.First the Northern Irishman set McLennan free on the right with a cross field pass. The young winger ran at Livi, reaching the angle of the box.His initial cross was blocked, but, receiving it back, he fired the ball to the waiting McGinn to volley low past Kelly.On  minutes, McLennan combined well with Cosgrove before working Kelly again at his near post as the home side tried to extend their lead.However, soon after, Livi created a chance, with Declan Gallagher’s low edge of the box strike tipped away well by Joe Lewis.Cosgrove could have added to his impressive tally for the season on  minutes, but his side-footed volley from Max Lowe’s penalty spot delivery was well wide.The visitors hit a surprise leveller on  minutes – Craig Sibbald tapping in on the line after a Halkett ball into the Dons area beat everyone. It may even have found the net without the attacker’s touch.Not long after the interval, Livi thought they were in front, Gallagher heading Keaghan Jacobs# corner from the left past Lewis – only for the flag to be raised.However, the visitors did seem to take a bit of a foothold in the game – with Aberdeen slightly out of sorts for a few minutes. Shinnie and Lewis Ferguson weren’t seeing much of the ball.McInnes clearly recognised this, with Campbell sent on for May soon after to win back the midfield.On  minutes, Dom Ball’s throw deep in the Lions’ half was taken by Ferguson, who beat two men as he ghosted inside before shooting over left footed from  yards out.It looked like Livi were content with a point, but, on  minutes, Kelly had to tip a whipped McGinn corner delivery away.The visitors began to sit very deep when the Dons had the ball, but were still probing occasionally for a sucker punch winner. Substitute Hakeem Odoffin blasted over from a long throw on  minutes.The Reds big chance came in the four additional minutes, with substitute Greg Stewart – thrown on alongside James Wilson to try and find a winner, firing wide of the left post from  yards."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/iStock-930824730-846x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen bosses set to take on inca redible adventure for vsa","story":"A team of north-east business chiefs are taking on a gruelling trek through the Peruvian Andes in an effort to raise cash.Five people from Aberdeen are hoping to raise vital funds and awareness for VSA – the region’s leading social care charity. vw, px\"  The adventurous group, led by the VSA’s director of finance Gordon Edwards, will endure a nine-day hike along the Inca Trail in April before reaching Machu Picchu.They aim to raise £, for VSA and are well on their way to reaching their target.The team includes John Mutch, the director of John Mutch Building Services, John Morrison, director of General and Technical Flooring, Kerry-Lee Hutton, Subsea  vessel accountant, and Aberdeen Royal Infirmary’s consultant anaesthetist Dr Alastair McDiarmid.Mr Edwards said: “I’ve always wanted to take on the Inca Trail challenge to reach one of the most iconic sights in the world, Machu Picchu, all while raising funds for VSA’s mental health services.“Having worked for VSA for the last three years I’m fully aware of the wonderful range of services VSA provides, both residential and outreach services, to support people with a wide range of mental health needs.“Our services are more crucial than ever with around one in three people diagnosed with a mental health condition each year in Scotland.“I’m delighted that five of us are going on the trek as we aim to raise funds and awareness for VSA’s services.”The challenging route will lead the five through valleys and high passes up to , metersabove sea level.Mr Morrison said: “I’m delighted to be taking part and raising much-needed awareness and funds for the fantastic work VSA do for people with a mental health diagnosis in Aberdeen.“We are celebrating our th anniversary at General and Technical, and what better way to celebrate than to get involved for such a great cause.”To donate, keep updated on the team’s progress or to find out how to take on a challenge for VSA, visit vsa.org.uk"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/MPU-offers.jpg ","title":"aberdeen mens shed group celebrates as businessman donates new premises","story":"An Aberdeen community group is celebrating after a generous businessman helped put a roof over its head.The Bridge of Don and District Men’s Shed has been searching for a premises for several months which will allow it to get off the ground and apply for necessary funding.To help out, Jim Wright, owner of Bucksburn-based firm Securastore, donated a storage unit to the group – which the members intend to use to hold their workshops.Measuring ft by ft, the unit represents a huge step towards the group establishing its own premises.A number of dferent housing options have been mooted by the members but it is still looking for a permanent base.Members have been meeting in Kettock Lodge – the Aberdeen Action On Disability premises.Rab McKerron, vice-chairman of Bridge of Don and District Men’s Shed group, said: “He couldn’t do enough for us.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

The cash injection could double the  aerospace jobs in Ayrshire to . The money has been announced as part of the Ayrshire Growth Deal, which was agreed last Friday. Plans for two new aircraft hangars have been revealed. There will be a purpose-built ,ftsup aerospace and space innovation centre for research and business development in partnership with universities. A visitor centre promoting science around space and aviation is also included in the bid. And up to to ,ftsup of industrial manufacturing space is to be developed. Publicly-owned Glasgow Prestwick Airport has made a loss in the past. A transport assessment is taking place to weigh up the impact of expansion on rail and road links. The airport vision was revealed on Friday when the Ayrshire Growth Deal heads of terms agreement was signed by politicians. Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: “From a UK perspective Prestwick is one of the most important sites for aerospace and a potential spaceport.” Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the plans would see the public and private sector join forces with academia to grow the aerospace and space sector. The deal sees pound million invested by the UK Government, pound million by the Scottish Government and pound million from South Ayrshire Council in the airport. South Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Campbell said the deal overall ensured Ayrshire “punches well above its weight in terms of what we contribute to the economy”. He described the signing of the heads of agreement as a “truly historic occasion” and the “pinnacle of more than three years of hard work.” Councillor Brian McGinley, local economy and culture chief, said: “To make the most of this investment we are determined that the benefits are shared by all, bringing quality training and jobs that will pay good wages.” Overall the pound. million Ayrshire Growth Deal aims to generate  jobs. The investment will be delivered over  years.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"end era popular ayr music","story":"NewsEnd of era as popular Ayr music shop shuts downBig Sparra Vinyl in Ayr has announced its closure following a recent flood at the New Bridge Street store.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsIan Wallace of Big Sparra Vinyl \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the end of an era for a much-loved record store which has touched the hearts- and ears- of many across the country.

The application got the go-ahead at the South Ayrshire Council Regulatory Panel last week. Discount store Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty and gardening products. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. Ayr Central operators MG Real Estate lodged an objection to the plan.

Mr Mitchell, of Zander Planning, said: “No units like that are available in the town centre.” Claiming it could bolster the town in general, he said: “Retail parks can draw people in from surrounding areas.” A document said the empty Homebase premises were too big for just one shop. Councillors approved requests to allow planning unit to be ided into two shops, and permit homeware goods and food to be sold from it.

And they called for better conditions for workers and customers. It is understood Ayr railway station will never operate from the abandoned building again. Now there are plans for Scotrail workers to move into other portable cabins at the bottom of the car park on Station Road. South Ayrshire Council was forced to take control of the privately owned Station Hotel last year when its dilapidated state made it a danger to the public. Station staff were moved to portable cabins beside the building. Mick Hogg, regional organiser for the RMT union in Scotland, said staff working conditions are unacceptable. He said: “We need a facility that is fit for purpose. “We would rather see the building demolished. We want to start from scratch to ensure our members are working in a safe environment.” He added: “Our members and the travelling public should not be subjected to any health and safety risk as a result of this shambles at Ayr Station. The shambles has been created by the refusal of Network Rail and other stakeholders to take ownership of a building that was falling to bits.” Union representatives want workers moved to the better portacable cabins on the other side of the railway tracks as soon as possible. Health and safety rep Willie Harper said: “It has been very challenging.” Gerry McCann, an RMT official from Ayr, said: “The staff are crammed into a portable cabins. There is no fresh running water.” He said facilities were not good enough for rail passengers. People waiting for trains to Glasgow or bus links to the ferries at Cairnryan have no shelter. He said: “People have to stand out in the rain. We want action.” An exclusion zone is in place around parts of the hotel to keep people away from the structure while work proceeds to make it safe. MSP Colin Smyth met the union and Scotrail to make the case for improvements last week. He said: “While staff had to be moved quickly out of offices which were part of the same building as the Station Hotel due to safety fears, the temporary arrangements put in place don’t deliver for staff o.” The council are in discussions with Transport Scotland, Network Rail and Scotrail about the future of the building. A Scotrail spokesman said: “We are committed to providing the best possible working environment for our people. We are working closely with our Network Rail Scotland colleagues and trade union representatives to deliver a long- term solution for the facilities atAyr Station.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilTransport ScotlandAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"border-league-enjoys-chess-master-class-during-grand-day-out-in-galashiels","story":"ITS claimed chess could help reduce social isolation in the Borders.But, with the increase in popularity and speed of games online, its feared local clubs are in danger of disappearing.Selkirks Martin Keen says the regular meets are ideal for getting people out the house - young and old - and hes encouraging them to swap their computers for a traditional board once a week.Mr Keen said: \"Wed love to see more players coming along and just turning up for a casual game of chess, whether that be at Gala, Selkirk, Kelso, or Berwick - they even have a club at NHS Borders.\"Especially with competing interests online, come out and challenge yourself and come and play face to face with people.

how does a small childs cross pose a risk to anyone \"And from what we were told, they were going to inform familiesa stone required work to make it safe.\"There are now broken gravestones lying all over our cemetery - this wasnt a safety inspection.\"Scottish Borders Council is responsible for  cemeteries across the region.And they have health and safety obligations for all employees, contractors and visitors to each of the graveyards.Although headstones are the responsibility of the lair-holder, due to the age of many graves tracing families is dficult.A five-year rolling programme of safety checks began in September with  cemeteries earmarked for the initial checks.But for several families the heavy-handed testing regime - which has left many memorials broken - has come as a shock.One daughter, who we agreed not to name, said: \"My parents grave is neither old nor what you would describe as large, yet it has been taken from its base.\"I have been really upset by this -I or any of my family had known the stone was loose we would have had it repaired.\"Nobody has been in touch with me or my brother.\"According to the Scottish Borders Councils own guidelines on the testing procedures, an initial sight test would be followed,required, by a gentle hand push.All memorials were to be classed as either stable, slight movement or unsafe.And only memorials found to be in a dangerous condition will be cordoned off and or made safe.The guidance also states that they will ensure the work is undertaken with due respect and only when absolutely necessary.Scottish Borders Council has defended the testing procedures by the contracted company.A spokesman for the authority told us: \"The council took the decision to test all the headstones in the old section of Peebles Cemetery, regardless of size and age, following a risk assessment.\"This is part of a phased approach to testing which sees sections of cemeteries categorised based on estimated footfall, age, location and size of the memorials.\"So far the majority of unstable memorials tested across the Borders have been made safe by socketing, which means keeping the headstone upright with the majority of the inscription still visible for families and visitors to read.\"This is a recognised approach which balances the cultural importance associated with these historic memorials and the need to keep our cemeteries safe for the public to visit.\"Socketing is the preferred technique compared to other alternative methods such as lying flat, staking, banding or full repair, all of which carry signicant consequences to the future stability of the memorials or signicant costs.\"A total of  headstones were tested in Peebles Cemetery with  deemed unsafe.Council bosses have admitted they will discuss issues over stones being broken during the inspection.The spokesman added: \"We accept that during this signicant safety programme, and considering the nature of the memorials that we are dealing with, there will be occasions where a memorial can become damaged while being made safe.\"If anyone notices a memorial which they have a legal interest in and which they believe has been damaged during the process of making it safe, they can contact the council to discuss the matter further.\"Other graveyards which are included in the initial phase of inspections are Innerleithen, Wairds , Shawfield , Ashkirk, Earlston, Heriot, Lilliesleaf, Kelsoand Kelso , Ancrum, Denholm, Wellogateand Wilton , Ayton, Duns, Lennel and Eyemouth.Babies graves, war graves and many brokenWhere a memorial is classied as unsafe and there is an immediate safety concern, thememorial will be made safe.

The objectors also presented evidence to the committee showing how their own planning policies were being ignored by their officials.Peebles Community Council and many residents objected to the land at South Parks site being earmarked for development in the Local Development Plan back in .Mr Turnbull said: ldquoWhat makes objectors particularly annoyed is the notion that once building sites have been included in Local Development Plans, their inclusion cannot be questioned.\"Their views then were ignored just as their views have been totally ignored now. One of the questions that needs to be asked is, why Mr Turnbull said the conduct of the planning committee with the housing application was ldquoappalling and added that the system is loaded in favour of developers.He added: ldquoWell over  dferent objectors submitted some very detailed evidence to planners who ignored it.\"This has brought many objectors to question the validity of the planning process. It would appear that this process is designed to allow developers to build as and when they want and they can appealtheir application is refused.ldquoObjectors on the other hand have no right of appeal given that they have no right of appeal it is surely essential that they are given a fair hearing where evidence is properly considered.ldquoIn the South Parks case, Councillor Fullarton made comments regarding the Caledonian Road being wide and safe, based on his knowledge of over  years ago - no one challenged him.ldquoWhat has caused so much anger was that not a single councillor on the committee knew enough about Peebles to question Councillor Fullartonrsquos assertion. It may be that the planning committee has insufficient time to deal properly with these more complicated and contentious applicationsthat is the case then something has to change.ldquoThey simply failed to understand the issues before them nor the tremendous amount of anger within our community.\"The Scottish Government has launched an initiative called Democracy Matters, which aims to improve the level of involvement of local communities.Mr Turnbull continued: ldquoWhat is the pointplanning officers can write what they want, ignore government guidance and legislation, which is then allowed to stand by councillors who either do not have the knowledge to challenge them or the will to do so. For democracy to matter the peoplesrsquo voice needs to be heard.The community leader says the democratic deficit will be brought into sharp focus with the next Local Development plan, and heeded a warning to elected councillors to be prepared to answer why Peebles is mooted for major development when Scottish Borders Council is not prepared to develop infrastructure first.Scottish Borders Council strongly refutes the claims that councillors and officials ignored the views of the community.A spokesperson said: ldquoAll planning decisions require the delicate balancing of a range of policy objectives and other material factors, including the views expressed by the Community Council.\"The two recent planning applications in Peebles highlighted how dficult that can be and the complexity of the decision making process. Both proposals were subject to detailed analysis, which was reflected in the presentation of the cases by officers and the y debate members had on these applications.ldquoIt is clear that a considerable amount of time was spent considering the points and issues made both for and against the proposed developments. Indeed, both applications were revised to take into consideration the views expressed by local residents and the Community Council.ldquoUltimately, and after considering all of the evidence before them, the Committee came to the view that it could support one of the applications, which was the development at South Parks. The application at Tweedbridge Court was refused."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-peer-lord-steel-suspended-from-lib-dems-after-giving-evidence-about-cyril-smith","story":"BORDERS peer Lord Steel has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats, pending an investigation into evidence he gave to an inquiry about child abuse allegations against former MP Sir Cyril Smith.The move, announced by the Scottish Liberal Democrats, comes after Lord Steel, a former Scottish Parliament presiding officer, gave evidence to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuseon Wednesday.The party had already announced they have started disciplinary proceedings against him, after he told the probe a conversation with Smith left him \"assuming\" the allegations were correct, but the party did not investigate them.The decision followed a meeting of senior figures within the Scottish party on Thursday evening.In a subsequent statement, the Scottish Liberal Democrats said: \"Following the evidence concerning Cyril Smith given by Lord Steel to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse on th March , the office bearers of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have met and agreed that an investigation is needed.\"The party membership of Lord Steel has been suspended pending the outcome of that investigation.

The road up to Langlee Mains Farm is not suitable for the type of cycles yoursquore talking about, itrsquos a narrow, twisty road with zones of invisibility.ldquoIf there is to be parking, I suggest you look where.Councillors voted unanimously to submit the plans to the public for consultation, and for a report to be brought back to the committee in the future.Council officers also confirmed that the trail network will require planning permission, which will give residents a second opportunity to submit their thoughts on the development."},{"url":null,"title":"iceland-store-boss-admits-ignoring-21-parking-tickets","story":"A SUPERMARKET manager has been hit with a four figure bill after ignoring a y string of parking tickets.David Humphries car was frequently ticketed over several months after being parked in a pay and display area behind the Iceland store in High Street, Galashiels, where he works.But the -year-old never paid the tickets or answered letters from the Scottish Borders Council asking him to reveal the identication of the driver, so the fines could be sent to the culprit.Now he has been fined a whopping pound, for ignoring the council letters - pound for each offence - and there is still a pound bill outstanding for the  original parking offences between April and July last year.Humphries of Bourtree Place, Hawick, pleaded guilty at Selkirk JP Court to a total of  charges.Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser told the court that there was no CCTV in the car park showing who had come to collect the car on the days of the offences and Humphries had never informed the council of the identity of the driver despite the repeated requests.But he pointed out Humphries worked in the Iceland store which is right beside the High Street car park.Mr Fraser also said that failing to reveal the identity of the driver carried a maximum penalty of pound, for each offence.He explained that the council had to go through the laborious process of establishing who the regular keeper of the vehicle was and to find out who the driver was for the penalty to be paid.Mr Fraser said:\"In relation to all these charges he ignored the correct parking penalty which was not paid.\"There were other people who could have used this car parkspace but have not been able to do so.\"The accuseds vehicle repeatedly committed the offences of being parked overtime.\"Who did that we do not know as the accused did not bother to communicate with the council and say who the driver was which is a legal requirement.\"Not guilty pleas to nine other charges relating to the parking offences were accepted by the Crown.Defence lawyer Colin Severin said his client was negotiating with the council about the outstanding parking fines.He added: \"He got to the point where he was bogged down with the volume of letters coming through and did not know how to react.\"Andrew Bramhall JP told Humphries that ulging the identity of the identity of the driver when an offence is committed was an important part of the Road Traffic Act legislation.He said: \"The onus was on you and it has mounted up considerably.\"Mr Bramhall said he would have fined Humphries pound for each offence but restricted the fine to pound due to the guilty plea.As there were  offences, the fine totalled pound -

After his first two space launch attempts ended in failure, it is no surprise that Elon Musk#s SpaceX recently took a dummy to the International Space Station.Solo ocean crossings in a sailing boat are another example of a sport that seems too risky to many.Free Solo tells of Honnold#s perfectionism but ultimately he relies on  practice, friction, magnesium carbonate chalk for his sweaty palms and his wits.Throughout the ascent, and the preamble which leads to it, including romance and his girlfriend#s struggle #to understand#, Honnold is filmed by his friends, some of whom cannot bear to watch the final solo.Extreme solo feats have existed as long as humans. The marathon developed in Ancient Greece as a solo running challenge and people still die in the st century emulating those barefoot warriors.Climbing and mountaineering has a long history of solo risk taking and many of its protagonists live relatively short lives.Some though, such as legendary Italian Walter Bonatti, were hard wired for solitary ascents. He shot to fame in the s with a solo ascent of a climb on the Dru, renamed the Bonatti Pillar, in the French alps.Bonatti finished his hard climbing career in  with a solo in winter of the north face of the Matterhorn for the centenary of that mountain#s first attempt. He passed away, aged , in bed.Up till Free Solo, many films about climbing have only been of real interest to climbers and have not made it into mainstream cinema.Using the latest techniques including drones, remote cameras, huge telephoto lenses on digital cameras from the valley floor and cameras wielded by dangling climbers has created a National Geographic movie which has transfixed audiences.Even climbers emerge after an-hour-and-a-half with sweaty palms after the glimpse into Honnold#s seemingly nihilistic world.A still of Alex Honnold during his climb.

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

Still, mixing metaphors and managers, in the words of Ally MacLeod in , itrsquoll be fine once we get to the World Cup. It might well bethe final  minutes in west London was anything to pin your hopes on.With France beating Italy and Wales clinching the Grand Slam against the Irish, it effectively turned the Twickenham game in to a dead rubber. Just pride and some old forged rupees to play for. A chance for some exhibition stuff, surely  Yes, but no-one could possibly have predicted the twists and turns that would fill match time.Yesterday began with the match ball being delivered, after a bike run from Stirling to Twickers, by former Scotland captain Rob Wainwright, round the world biker Mark Beaumont, endurance cyclist Russell Ky and a few other on their latest Doddie Gump, on behalf of the My Namersquo Doddie Foundation. A worthy cause, but as England were running in tries for fun during the opening exchanges at the rate of a point per minute, a well-intentioned wrong turning somewhere in the Midlands may have been a better idea. No ball, no game.The day started badly for the Scots and deteriorated. Irsquom not a fan of the tune, but who dictates Flower of Scotland should be played in waltz-time  Take your partners for a St Bernardrsquos.For Scottish football fans, lsquorsquo means so much. Yesterday that was all it took, in seconds, for England to score. Cue lsquoSweet Chariot.rsquo Unfortunately, it was supercharged and had four-wheel drive and rumbled over the Scots in those early battles. Around this time I received a text from a mate. ldquoHeading back in to Richmond and the Orange Tree. Cannae watch this. I hope they had a telly.For when all appeared lost, from somewhere, Scotland managed to pull out a fightback of epic proportions. Guys who had looked lost, suddenly became world -beaters McInally, Maitland, Graham, Russell, Johnson and others, all of them really. We knew Scotland could play like that. We had seen it before. But given how their self-belief must have been steamrollered in that opening quarter, this effort will be written in to Scots rugby,not sporting folklore. But let us not forget how close wersquod come to an absolute disaster yesterday before salvaging self-respect and some much-needed championship points. But what, ultimately, have we achieved this far in to  Before a ball was kicked, passed or dropped in anger, I had upset one or two with my prediction that, at best, Scotland might finish fourth in this yearrsquos Six Nations. My guesstimate actually had a bit of logic behind it. Italy was a given, but we donrsquot win on the road that often, especially in Paris or London, while Ireland and Wales are quitedecent teams, but at Murrayfield, we just might ndash with a decent wind - shade it against one of them.We didnrsquot and fourth became fth, accompanied by a catalogue of excuses not turning pressure in to points, not being accurate or clinical enough, and, not having any luck when it comes to losing key personnel. Letrsquos take that point firstThere has been a steady progression at international level whereby Scotland has built strength and experience in depth, something that on reflection, really wasnrsquot there a decade back, no matter how much we may kid ourselves. However, unlike England and perhaps the French, Scotland still donrsquot have the cover or resource to accommodate a casualty count running in to double figures,not dozens.Even for the layman, the attrition rate during this championship has not gone unnoticed. Five test matches in seven weeks, particularly given the intensity of the international game today, is enough to break bodies. Good job no-one has ever been daft enough to think out loud that five successive weekend Tests could be an option in the future.However, much of Scotlandrsquos woes have been self-imposed. Compared to  months ago, when we looked to score on any play, from any position, over the last few weeks we have collectively just ran up too many blind alleys. Yes, it all fell in to place latterly against England, but be honest, on another day wersquod have been crushed and left humiliated.Instead we werenrsquot, instead we left with a touch of optimism, and instead of pain, we left with that ancient silver pot, the Calcutta Cup.Moving pictures of Scotlandrsquos last victory at Twickenham are not quite in monochrome, more a slightly washed-out colour. The video tape should last a few more years before it breaks down to dust, through age. However, after our near- disintegration yesterday, we still live with the prospect of that historic recording decaying before we win again.Better teams than the one eventually selected by Gregor Townsend have biennially headed south, more in hope than honest belief in search of that illusive victory.

She never gives up. She hung around to clear up the Brexit mess left by her awful predecessor. Only a hard heart could disagree with this analysis.Theresa May also deserves a degree of sympathy for her decision to push for a general election in . Almost every commentator, it should be recalled, believed she would rout Jeremy Corbyn and lay the path for a Brexit deal. The fault lay in the hapless campaign she led, not in the triggering of an election.Nearly two years later, May is the central character in a Westminster horror story. No matter how she rolls the dice, no majority appears to exist for any form of Brexit. She is bringing back her draft withdrawal agreement this week, but she is in need of a political miracle.This is where personal sympathy ends and political blame can rightly be aimed in her direction. May, and nobody , is the architect of a Brexit impasse that could see the UK crash out of the European Union without a deal. MPs ldquovoted against this outcome last week, but only EU member states can grant an extension to Article . The EU can name its price.Mayrsquos historic blunder was in laying out a series of Brexit ldquored lines at her partyrsquos conference in . Showing off in front of the Tory faithful, she ruled out the UK staying in either the customs union or the single market, which at a stroke necessitated the creation of the hated Northern Ireland backstop. Withdrawing the UK from the scope of the European Court of Justice - a May obsession from her days at the Home Office - was also written in blood.Her rigid approach may have drawn applause from hundreds of elderly Tories in the conference hall, but the red lines made it impossible for Labour, the SNP or the Lib Dems to support her Brexit plan. She put herself at the mercy of right-wing colleagues in European Research Group and the Democratic Unionist Party. The ideologues were given a veto.Mayrsquos mistake was in forgetting her partyrsquos history. In , John Major was challenged for the leadership by Cabinet colleague John Redwood, whose campaign was motivated by hostility to the EU. A photograph of his supporters from that period is a historical curiosity. It shows a small band of hardliners - people like the late Teddy Taylor and Teresa Gorman - who could not compromise on their loathing of the EU. This grouplet is now a large faction and is blocking Mayrsquos deal. She has allowed herself to be captured by the ERG and held hostage.Brexit is consuming the nation, but the UKrsquos departure from the EU is a tragic plot line in a Tory soap opera. David Cameron committed his party to a referendum in a bid to appease his right wing and stop the rise of UKIP. He refrained from ldquoblue on blue attacks during the campaign for fear of splitting the Conservatives. From beginning to end, Cameron was concerned about party management. May has copied this insular strategy.Her flawed approach brings two options into focus this week. The first is for her ERG tormentors to back her deal, which would be followed by a short extension to Article . Few people expect the militants to turn into eleventh-hour pragmatists. The second option is, on the back of her deal being rejected for a third time, to ask the EU for a much ier delay.Such an outcome would present a huge opportunity for a Prime Minister who was concerned with bringing the country together, rather than healing her partyrsquos wounds. With a yearrsquos breathing room, she could ditch her red lines and hurl the ERG into obscurity. If May backed either a soft Brexit, or a confirmatory vote on her deal, a majority of MPs would follow her.The last thirty years suggest that May will look inwards, not outwards.

I do not think that that would be the right outcome, but the House needs to face up to the consequences of the decisions that it has taken.The SNP Government, however, which supports a so-called Peoplersquos Vote, is sympathetic to the European elections taking place.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Government is calling for the Article  EU withdrawal process to be extended for as long as it takes to enable a second referendum on EU membership to be held.ldquoIn those circumstances, discussions would have to take place with the EU regarding elections for the European Parliament taking place in the UK ndash and we are confident this could be delivered across Scotland.ldquoHolding an election,that was necessary, would clearly be preferable to Scotland being forced out of the EU under the damaging terms of the Prime Ministerrsquos deal or the catastrophe of a lsquono dealrsquo outcome.An SNP insider said the party would contest any poll on an anti-Brexit  and reflect the views of the majority of people north of the border.It is understood the SNPrsquos governing national executive committee has taken steps present a list of candidates, should an election take place.Keith Brown, the SNPrsquos depute leader, said: \"Theresa May has made such a hash of Brexit, we started preparations in January.

Those discussions will continue over the coming period of time.\"Former Cabinet minister Esther McVey suggested fellow Brexiteers could back Mays \"rubbish\" deal next week to make sure the UK leaves the EU.She told the BBC: \"The element now is that people will have to take a bad deal rather than no deal.\"It has also emerged that senior Tory MP Nick Boles has quit his local Conservative Association in the face of efforts to deselect him as the candidate for the next election amid rows over Brexit.The former minister, who supports a soft Brexit, told members of Grantham and Stamford Conservative Association he was resigning \"with immediate effect\" but will continue to \"take the Conservative whip at Westminsterit is offered \"on acceptable terms\", according to a letter.Councillor Martin Hill, vice president of the Grantham and Stamford Conservative Association, told members: \"As you are all aware, Nick has been at odds with the local party and the Prime Minister for some time, so this announcement does not come as a complete surprise, but the timing does leave at lot to be desired.Chief Whip Julian Smith said Mr Boles \"is a valued member of the Conservative Parliamentary party which I hope will continue to benefit from his ideas and drive\"."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-launches-effort-to-find-a-cross-party-brexit-compromise","story":"The Labour leader called for urgent meetings to finda ldquosolution that ends the needless uncertainty and worry caused by Prime Minister Theresa Mayrsquos ldquofailed Brexit negotiations.He said Labourrsquos ldquocredible plans would form the starting point for any discussions, but he was keen to find ldquocommon ground with supporters of other plans.The offer has been extended to SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds, Plaidrsquos Liz Saville Roberts and Green MP Caroline Lucas.Backbench MPs invited for talks with Mr Corbyn and shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer include Labourrsquos Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, who have put forward a plan for the Commons to allow the Prime Ministerrsquos Brexit deal to go through, subject to a referendum.Senior Labour backbenchers Yvette Cooper, Hilary Benn and Rachel Reeves have also been offered talks, along with Tories Ken Clarke and Nicky Morgan.Invitations have also been sent to Sir Oliver Letwin, Nick Boles, Stephen Kinnock and Lucy Powell ndash the Tory and Labour MPs behind a push for a Norway-style soft Brexit inside the single market with a customs union.Labourrsquos Jack Dromey and Tory former minister Dame Caroline Spelman, who led Commons efforts to reject a no-deal Brexit, have also been offered a meeting.Mr Corbyn said: ldquoLabour has set out credible options as to how we propose to break the deadlock and avoid a disastrous no-deal.ldquoThis includes putting forward an alternative Brexit plan with a permanent customs union, single market deal and dynamic alignment on rights and protections.ldquoWe have also said that we would support a public vote to prevent damaging Brexit proposals being forced on the country.ldquoWe would obviously use that position as a starting point for any discussions, but we would like to hear about the plans you are advocating, and we are keen to seethere is scope to find common ground between our respective proposals and to work together to break the impasse."},{"url":null,"title":"vince-cable-uses-farewell-conference-speech-to-stress-commitment-to-staying-in-eu","story":"Sir Vince, who will step down as Lib Dem leader after the local elections in May, said the party had to continue arguing for the benefits of staying in the European Union as the Brexit debate rages at Westminster.He will use his speech in York on Sunday to accuse Theresa May of putting a higher priority on keeping the Conservative Party together than maintaining peace in Northern Ireland in her efforts to revise the Brexit dealrsquos backstop.Declaring that ldquowe are Remain, he will say: ldquoTo those outside the Westminster bubble, the parliamentary games on Brexit are baffling: a weird combination of snakes and ladders, chess and all-in wrestling.ldquoWhatever happens in the next few weeks of parliamentary twists and turns, we must argue ndash since no-one  can be relied upon to do so ndash that none of the several mutually exclusive versions of Brexit on offer ndash soft or hard ndash are as good as the deal we currently have.Just finished speaking to @LibDems #LDconf rally.

Shersquos blissfully unaware of the conversation her parents are having at the kitchen table.The dresser behind Jamie and Victoria McCallum is filled with dozens of birthday cards from Rosiersquos classmates. Shersquos just turned six - but the couple are discussing what le would have been liketheyrsquod terminated the pregnancy. Rosie was born with Downrsquos Syndrome.The McCallums didnrsquot have to confront the idea of termination, however, while Victoria was pregnant. They didnrsquot take any tests. It was only when Rosie was born that they realised she had Downrsquos Syndrome. Victoria wouldnrsquot have terminated, eventests had come back positive. Jamie, though, knowing nothing about the condition then, might have thought dferently.lsquoWe wouldrsquove had a hell of a debate on our hands,rsquo he says. Victoria wonders aloud lsquowhether our relationship would have survivedrsquo. Itrsquos impossible to quanty the joy theyrsquod have lostthere was no Rosie in their lives. Today, knowing the facts about Downrsquos Syndrome, termination would never cross Jamiersquos mind.The McCallums have grown from a family devastated by Downrsquos Syndrome to one enriched by the condition. Jamie, , runs his own management consultancy, and Victoria, , worked in marketing but now raises their children at home. Theyrsquore among the most prominent advocates in Scotlandrsquos Downrsquos Syndrome community, and Rosie is something of a superstar within that world, a child who can count Michael Bubleacute, the singer Christina Perri, and Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby among her admirers.Those birthday cards on the dresser - from  children across their home town, Prestwick - tell the story of the changing nature of Downrsquos Syndrome within society. Years ago, there would have been no cards from friends.Every family touched by the condition shudders when they think of the past - of times like the s when children were locked away in institutions, their le chances little more than zero. Today, children with Downrsquos Syndrome are increasingly embraced by society, they look forward to a future where they go to mainstream school, get a job, live independently and fall in love. There are young people with Downrsquos Syndrome embarking on careers in theatre and sport Karen Gaffney, one of the worldrsquos best known people with Downrsquos Syndrome, swam the channel, earned an honorary doctorate, and gave a Ted talk.On Thursday itrsquos the McCallums th wedding anniversary . lsquoClearly le had a path for us,rsquo says Victoria. The family have a message to share, on this week which means so much to them. They fear that just as people with Downrsquos Syndrome are becoming accepted by mainstream society, that they may - in Jamiersquos words - soon be lsquoeradicatedrsquo.Until now, accurate testing for Downrsquos Syndrome centred on an amniocentesis, where a needle draws fluid from the uterus for analysis. Some parents are reluctant to take the test, fearing miscarriage. Now, a new blood test is to be rolled out which can accurately check for Downrsquos Syndrome without risk. The take up is expected to be huge, and the resulting terminations equally high. At the moment, the abortion rate is around  per cent. Scotland has a population of , with  births a year.lsquoIceland rolled [the new testing] out and there hasnrsquot been a Downrsquos Syndrome birth since,rsquo says Jamie. lsquoItrsquos like a government-funded eugenics programme.rsquoThe thought of a world without Rosies horries the McCallums. Both admit to being completely uninformed when Rosie - the middle of their three children - was born. Itrsquos impossible to make an informed choice about termination when all parents know are the long-standing myths - that children wonrsquot be able to dress themselves, or go to the toilet that theyrsquoll be le-long lsquoburdensrsquo, or incapable of learning.Jamie says his view of Downrsquos Syndrome when he was growing up was lsquoa form of prejudice - and prejudice comes from ignorancersquo. He would have seen lsquosomeone who canrsquot possibly be happy as they donrsquot have the faculties of the rest of us, and thatrsquos why itrsquos such a shake-up to your value system when you realise wersquove made all that stuff uprsquo.Victoria is brutally honest but even she struggles to admit that when she was growing up she probably saw people with Downrsquos Syndrome as lsquoretardedrsquo. lsquoThatrsquos a really awful thing to say,rsquo she adds. lsquoI remember feeling sorry for them. They werenrsquot accepted, they always stood on the periphery hellip When I fell pregnant one of my biggest fears was Downrsquos Syndrome.rsquoNevertheless, like many parents, they didnrsquot opt for an amniocentesis as they werenrsquot high risk. It wasnrsquot until moments after Rosiersquos birth that they realised she had Downrsquos Syndrome.lsquoI was shit scared,rsquo says Victoria. She looked at her babyrsquos eyes and lsquojust knewrsquo. Jamie was oblivious. He was holding Rosie - lsquoproud as punchrsquo - and had no idea anything was wrong until Victoria askedhe thought she had Downrsquos Syndrome. Jamie put Rosie down, took his phone to the bathroom and looked for lsquobabies with Downrsquos Syndromersquo on Google images.lsquoI knew at that point,rsquo Jamie says, but his words falter as tears overcome him. Victoria becomes upset at Jamiersquos distress and explains: lsquoItrsquos a post traumatic stress thing. It was a brutal experience.rsquoJamie continues: lsquoI just put her down and I didnrsquot pick her up again for quite some time.rsquo Victoria adds: lsquoI shut off and went into automatic mother mode. I just went lsquoI canrsquot cope with this so what I need to do is look after this babyrsquo - and Irsquod basically say lsquothis thingrsquo as at that time thatrsquos how I felt. Itrsquos brutal but itrsquos true.rsquolsquoYoursquove this path in your mind,rsquo says Jamie, lsquoand all of a sudden your entire future gets reformed - and then pour in all your prejudice, ignorance and misconceptions.rsquoVictoria was so traumatised after the birth that she couldnrsquot go to a maternity ward to visit her best friend and baby. Jamie went but lsquoa feeling of dread descended on me. You see things, like the number on the door, and itrsquos like flashbacksrsquo.The McCallums kept each other afloat those first few months - when one was down, the other was up. Victoria recalls crying as she breastfed Rosie and wonderingshe was in the middle of a lsquogrief cyclersquo and lsquoletting go of the child I expected to haversquo.She spent lsquothe first eight weeks of Rosiersquos le trying to figure outI wanted to keep herrsquo. Victoriarsquos voice falters and her eyes fill as she talks about how her sisters find that hard to believe because she was so protective of Rosie lsquofrom the moment she was bornrsquo.At one point, Jamie tried to rationalise what had happened by thinking of Rosie as a pet. Theyrsquore both shocked at the thoughts which went through their minds.Unlike many children with Downrsquos Syndrome, Rosie had no severe health problems, such as a congenital heart condition, so there was little dference raising Rosie to any other baby.Slowly, the couple began to think lsquowait a minute, why is this meant to be so bad rsquo. There was lsquono Hollywood momentrsquo, says Jamie, when things went from dark to light, but he recalls feeding Rosie one day when she was six months and apologising to her aloud. lsquoAt that point I believed it would be okay,rsquo he says, lsquoand thatrsquos a major hurdlersquo.Things changed for Victoria when she thought about adoption, but couldnrsquot imagine anyone caring for Rosie the way she could. She recalls going to a Downrsquos Syndrome meeting and realising lsquoI just want to be her mumrsquo.The mundane reality is that le with Downrsquos Syndrome just takes a little bit longer. Children will learn to read, walk, talk, go to the toilet, feed themselves - just like any other child - but theyrsquoll always be a little slower. Rosie is probably a year behind other children.Children with Downrsquos Syndrome learn dferently too. Theyrsquore more perceptive of emotions, and visual learners, says Jamie, so they identy the physical shapes of words quicker than sounds - thatrsquos why their house is plastered with stickers on furniture and appliances marked lsquoovenrsquo, lsquotable, lsquochairrsquo. They also use sign language to speed up Rosiersquos acquisition of speech.Rosie is in pre-school and about to go into Primary One. Children like her in mainstream education help eliminate prejudice. Unlike their parents, the children in Rosiersquos class have grown up with a friend with Downrsquos Syndrome and are basically blind to her condition. lsquoI can see the positive effects of Rosie on other people,rsquo says Jamie.Hersquos jealous of Rosiersquos classmates. lsquoWersquove created a society that values material things - cars, money - and these kids will grow up with someone who isnrsquot driven by that, and lives in the now, all the time, and her driving force is to be happy.rsquoVictoria adds: lsquoPeople say itrsquos changed their way of thinking, just being part of her le. She teaches us more than we could ever teach her. She teaches us to be far, far better human beings, and just be happier people.rsquoRosie and a bunch of other children with Downrsquos Syndrome touched the world this time last year when a viral video of the kids and their mums lip-synching and hand-signing a carpool karaoke version of Christina Perrirsquos lsquoA Thousand Yearsrsquo clocked  million views. Perri contacted them saying shersquod cried over the film - her song ed to the top five. It made national news in  countries, and Victoria and other mums appeared on This Morning. Michael Bubleacute got involved when the children covered lsquoAll I want for Christmasrsquo. The McCallums started the charity lsquoWouldnrsquot Change A Thingrsquo, celebrating children like Rosie, and aimed at correcting those misconceptions which caused them so much grief when she was born.Jamie says in the past hersquos told people that Downrsquos Syndrome lsquoisnrsquot as bad as you think, but now Irsquove actually come to believe that therersquos serious benefits to this - like the effect on others, like the positive effect on your own values. It makes you a better personrsquo.lsquoThe paradox is,rsquo adds Jamie, lsquothat therersquos been this major progress in understanding how they learn, major medical progress too, and thatrsquos happening simultaneously with the progress in screening and termination to the point of almost eradication. So just as yoursquove kind of cracked it on one side, therersquoll be none of them left.rsquoThe idea of there one day being no more people with Downrsquos Syndrome chills them, thinking of what would be lost. lsquoYou see beyond peoplersquos disabilities to the soul behind that, you see the person,rsquo says Victoria. lsquoThatrsquos what Rosie has taught me.rsquoJamie and Victoria treat Rosie no dferently to their other children, Abigail and Gregor - and she can get in just as much trouble as them. The McCallums expect a full le for Rosie - job, travel, love.lsquoWhen we first had Rosie,rsquo says Victoria, lsquoI was very scared that wersquod have her for the rest of our lives, but actually Rosiersquos biggest problem about leaving this house is going to be me not wanting her to go. I think the first child out the door will be her - shersquos the most independent. Irsquom not scared for her future now in any way whatsoever.rsquoWHEN WORDS CUT AS DEEP AS WOUNDSWHILE so much has changed for the better in society when it comes to the lives of people with Downrsquos Syndrome, language is still a blight.

One case Chinese visitor is said to have set aside pound. million for a three-day tour of the Highlands.While that is at the extreme end of the scale, insiders say itrsquos not unusual for ldquoaverage visitors to spend pound, per person for a week, while others can easily spend double that on a single shopping spree at the House of Bruar.One luxury tour operator said: ldquoThe sky is the limit. A lot of whatrsquos going on is very discreet ndash most people donrsquot realise the amount of money flowing through the country.In many cases the millionaire tourist is looking to pay top dollar to share a dram with a whisky expert, play golf on a remote Hebridean course that most Scots have never heard of, or join scallop ers and fishermen off the west coast, rather than rub shoulders with the hoi polloi at the usual tourist haunts.According to a report from Allied Market Research, the global luxury market is projected to be the fastest-growing area of the tourism sector, expected to be worth ,bn by .A key element is said to be demand from high-end travellers to gain deeper experiences of the places they visit, avoiding tourist hotspots in favour of highly-personalised trips.VisitScotland has suggested income from ldquohigh-net-worth iniduals is forecast to rise by around % a year. Chief executive Malcolm Roughead said: ldquoIt is important that we encourage the tourism industry to provide world-class service, facilities, events and attractions to keep up with ever-changing consumer demands and ensure visitors continue to have memorable experiences.While luxury tour operators have always had a place in Scotlandrsquos tourist sector, there are signs of a growing response to rising demand, from hotels offering bespoke packages, to firms specialising in personalised itineraries and road trip specialists who send tourists off in Aston Martins to tackle the North Coast  ndash at around pound, a pop.Last week, five-star Edinburgh hotel The Glasshouse became the latest to join the luxury ldquoexperience market with a two-night Elite Whisky Experience ndash costing pound, a head.That buys two nights for two people at the hotelrsquos lavish Islay Suite overlooking Calton Hill, meals ndash including a seven-course whisky tasting dinner ndash guided tour of a distillery and the chance to explore the hotelrsquos selection of  whiskies with its whisky ambassador on hand to help with selections.One company, Bravo Whisky Golf, which specialises in tailor-made golf packages which whisk visitors from course to course by chartered plane, is offering three nights in an Islay hotel and chartered plane to watch this yearrsquos Open at Royal Portrush, plus a distillery tour and a round at Machrie Golf Links ndash for around pound,.ldquoTypically, clients will spend , to , per head for golf, accommodation, flights, meals and drinks, said Neil Scott Johnson, who co-founded Bravo Whisky Golf with his friend Paul Geddes. ldquoThese people have done Carnoustie, St Andrews and Turnberry and are looking for new experiences.

A group of  staying for a week can easily spend poundm.If anything, he adds, there is a shortage of luxury produce for them to spend their money on. ldquoThis is high-level tourism and we need to persuade people to join in and provide what they want, he said.Specialist companies like Edinburgh-based Dream Escape promise ldquoluxurious private cruises to exclusive access to historic castles and other elegant accommodation combined with Michelin-star dining, with chauffeur-driven tours, adventure activities and private helicopters.However, as well as the established players and the London-based high-end agencies, a new breed of ldquograss-roots operators is also finding a niche within a massively wealthy market.Chris Hunter of Luxury Concierge Scotland was running a chauffeur business when he spotted demand from wealthy visitors seeking ldquosomething dferent.He now organises bespoke tours, arranging castle accommodation, supercars for hitting the North Coast  and gourmet dining.ldquoI have a couple coming in June who want to tour in a car, so Irsquom organising a Porsche  for them. They want to stay in a castle on the west coast, and then therersquos the obligatory helicopter tour, so theyrsquoll go from the castle over to Skye for a distillery visit, he said.ldquoThese are people who can do spas and luxury hotels anywhere.

Launched in  in Londons Olympia, the annual event showcased interior and exterior housing designs as well as the latest in kitchen technology and over the ensuing decades, the vacuum cleaner, toaster and electric kettle all made their entrance at the Ideal Home Show, as it came to be known.This Friday, the th Ideal Home Show opens in London before coming to Scotland in May. So what exactly is the ldquoideal home and how have our aspirations changed from previous eras Location, location, locationldquoLocation is still the thing that drives buyers at every level of the market, says Max Mills, an Edinburgh-based director of Rettie  Co estate agents.So where do people want to live  It depends which poll you consult. According to a  Country Le magazine survey, % of urban dwellers want to relocate to the boondocks. Orkney was named the UKs best place to live in a recent quality of le survey and within Scotland, Dumfries and Melrose are respectively the ldquohappiest and the ldquobest place to live according to studies conducted in  and .In Edinburgh, the field of dreams, for those with poundm-plus to spend, includes Grange, Merchiston and Inverleith. Then again, says Max Mills: ldquoA million pounds is not a lot of money in Edinburgh on the residential property side poundm is the new poundm and people who are spending that kind of money will be more comfortable spending it in a street where they can see that other people around them have done the same.For more modestly endowed buyers in search of their first home, convenience and proximity to amenities matter most, while for ldquomiddle-market young familes, the crucial factor is often schools.Utopian dreamsDuring the optimistic post-war era, visions of the ldquoideal home were distinctly modern. Grand Victorian terraces and tenements were bulldozed, ornate fireplaces and plasterwork were ripped out and high ceilings were lowered. In the west of Scotland, planners seeking solutions to Glasgows housing shortage created Cumbernauld: a new town inspired by the hyper-modernist vision of Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. In decades to come, it would be twice maligned as Urban Realm magazines ldquocarbuncle of the year.ldquoUtopias often become dystopias when they are put into practice, says Eszter Steierhoffer, senior curator of the Design Museum, London.In fact, the th century was replete with Utopian ideas for transforming the domestic realm and many of the eras avant-garde fantasies ndash including walking buildings and robot housemaids ndash are explored in the Design Museums current exhibition, Home Futures.In the s, these wacky-seeming ideas were lampooned in American cartoon series, The Jetsons ndash a kind of space age version of The Flintstones only with robots, aerocars and push-button gadgets aplenty.But as Steierhoffer points out, todays ldquosmart homes arent far removed from those sci-fi visions. The question we need to ask, she suggests, is whether all this gadgetry is making our lives better and whose intereststhey are serving.Whats not in doubt, says Max Mills, is that high-end buyers now expect homes to come with state-of-the-art technology, including ldquoSonos systems throughout the house, cleverly placed non-intrusive TVs, underfloor heating and the best kitchen gadgets such cookers, wine coolers or microwave ovens.Paradoxically, perhaps, period properties have never been more desirable and Victorian fireplaces, cornices and other ldquooriginal features which survived the modernising zealotry of the s are highly prized.Space travelAlthough wealthy Victorians and Edwardians had parlours, morning rooms, bedrooms and myriad other dedicated apartments, many poorer Scots lived in one-roomed ldquosingle ends or rural blackhouses, which meant whole families sharing sleeping accommodation and even beds ndash sometimes with dead bodies, which were routinely kept at home for three days before burial. The advent of council housing from  placed compartmentalised living ndash and privacy ndash within the reach of working-class people.But in the s, aspirations went into reverse with the vogue for open-plan living and according to Max Mills, the formal dining room is now ldquoa thing of the past. Instead, everyone wants a big ldquohub of the house kitchen-dining-living space, evenwealthier buyers apparently expect an additional separate eating room and lounge for their poundm-plus.At the top end of the Edinburgh market, says Mills, people are ldquopushing boundaries and installing swimming pools, cinemas and gyms. Are they showing off  Mills says its rather a question of people ldquobeing proud of what theyve achieved, having put their hard-earned income into bricks and mortar.ldquoWe call it wealth preservation in Edinburgh, he adds. ldquoFor many people, a house isnt just a roof over their heads, its also an asset that they consider to be an investment, and a safe place to keep their money.Home suite homeIn , there were only five toilets in the whole of Dundee and three of them were in hotels. By the s and s, thanks to the post-war public housing revolution, nearly all Scottish homes had an indoor bathroom though by the s, sparkling white sanitary ware was being ripped out and replaced with peach, avocado or even dark brown ldquosuites.Today, says Max Mills, en-suites are becoming the norm andyou dont have at least one, youre considered to be ldquoletting the side down, especially at the high end of the property market.The ideal eco-homeAccording to Max Mills, home-hunters are increasingly eco-conscious: ldquoPeople used to roll their eyes when you said energy performance certicate, but now people are asking: Is the house going to be efficient to run  Are they thinking about their fuel bills or the planet  ldquoDefinitely the latter, he says.But are our dream homes really ldquoideal from an environmental perspective  Take all those Grand Design-esque ldquoeco-houses with their huge, panoramic windows and double-height open-plan spaces that could house a dozen families yet are built for mum, dad and . kids, who presumably have to be driven  miles to school each day from their gloriously remote turf-roofed abode. Can that really be sustainable Open-plan, double-height rooms are OK so long as the buildings fabric is well-insulated, ideally to ldquopassive house standard .As for those massive windows, he argues that maximising beautul viewscontributes to sustainability by making the house more desirable in the long term. From a resources perspective, ldquowe dont want to be knocking houses down and rebuilding.For the same reason, all those draughty old period properties need to be maintained, but refurbished to st-century performance standards. ldquoThats possible, he says, ldquoit just needs careful thought.He sees community self-build as a good way of providing sustainable homes that meet peoples long-term needs, and as for existing homes, ldquoconsumers need to be more discerning about how houses perform, in terms of carbon emissions. Even properties advertised as having top-rated energy efficiency often perform well below that standard, he adds.Living without wallsIn , the Austrian architect, Hans Hollein, envisioned that people would one day work from inflatable mobile offices. Three years later, the ldquoSupersurface was conceived as a universal grid that would allow people to live without objects. Both were meant to facilitate a le of permanent nomadism without the need for a physical home. Crazy  The Design Museums Eszter Steierhoffer believes we are already inhabiting a version of that dream. In big cities, where buying a home is becoming impossible for many young people, she sees signs that millennials are embracing a kind of ldquopost-ownership society, in that they share living space and carsand eat out rather than cook meals in the kitchen.ldquoOur behaviours in the face of new technologies are changing enormously, she says. ldquoPrivacy, for example, doesnt necessarily involve being between four walls, its about whether or not you switch on your phone, which has become your window on the world.ldquoHome can be thought about in a more expanded way. You can perform domestic activities way beyond the physical borders of what you would traditionally call your home. You can have your shower in the gym, have your breakfast in a cafe, work anywhere n your laptop.ldquoSo while at one time, the s of the ious parts of the home were quite rigid, that is beginning to blur as we use spaces in much more hybrid ways.Could it be that the ideal home of the future will not exist at all Ideal Home Show runs at the Olympia, London from Friday, March  until April .

She talks a good separatist game for the sake of her loyal band of dyed-in-the-wool nationalist supporters, yet does little.A y delay to Article  can be used by Ms Sturgeon to justy further indyref procrastination.

There are within the powers of Holyrood perfectly legal ways of ascertaining the will of the people in Scotland.The most obvious is to hold an advisory referendum, as the EU one was. Should that result in a less than % turnout, no problem. After all, no referendum has ever been declared null and void because of turnout, it being normally believed that those who do not bother to vote do not care one way or the other.In any case, it could easily be justied by comparison with the EU one which ascertained the ldquowill of the people on only .% or so of the vote, with a margin of win slightly less than that gained by ldquoYes in . Obviously, by current standards, ignoring that earlier vote is now seen by Westminster as a wrong decision and a lesser margin from less than % of electors can now be regarded as mandatory.Moreover, the acceptance last July by Westminster of the Claim of Right, with its confirmation that the people of Scotland, not any parliament or government, hold sovereignty, means that we do have a legal right to vote on the type of government we want without any need of permission of any sort. The fact that such ldquopermission was sought last time was merely a courtesy and a means of avoiding controversy and recrimination, which could have marred the civilised event that followed.Perhaps Mr Redfern and his colleagues in the letter-writing cabal of Scotland in Union would do well to contemplate the terms of the American Declaration of Independence, largely the input of Scots based on the Declaration of Arbroath:ldquoGovernments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed ... it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.What nation on earth requires permission of another to decide how it will be ruled L.

If you believe that ...This will be similar to the job promises that the wind industry made saying they would create thousands of jobs. Numerous \"renewables\" companies applied to the Scottish Government and were given substantial grants on the promise of new Scottish jobs then true to form they collapsed.Wind turbines are manufactured in China, Denmark and Germany and then shipped over here to be built by mainly foreign labour.

Over the weekend, we heard Nicola Sturgeon saythat the chaos of Brexit makes Scottish independence more likely. Her deputy Keith Brown also said the mess of Brexit might be the point at which momentum for independence becomes unstoppable. In other words, the SNP is hoping, still, that the Brexit chaos will drive voters into their arms.However, I wonderwe have really, properly looked for the clues in the chaos, the little signs to be found in the rubble, and asked what we can learn from them. The SNP keep arguing that the more people hate Brexit, the more they will love independence some unionists, on the other hand, argue Brexit is a clue to how hard negotiating Scottish independence will be. But letrsquos leave Mr Self and Mr Francois staring at each other for a minute shall we and take a look at the actual parallels between leaving the EU and leaving the UK. The picture is more mixed that you might think.Read more: Nicola Sturgeon signals Indyref push before For a start, the UK is not the same as the EU, although the dferences between them provide useful pointers. For instance ndash dficult as Brexit is ndash the fact that the UK is a sovereign state means it can leave the EU without having to make dficult decisions about what currency it uses for example it also doesnrsquot have to apply to join other international organisations or sort out its foreign or defence policies. All those questions have already been answered.Obviously, the same does not apply to Scotland ndash after voting for independence, it would be leaving a state rather than an organisation made up of states and would therefore have to make a lot of choices from scratch that the UK isnrsquot facing with Brexit. Scotland and rest of the UK also have shared assetsin a way that the UK and the EU donrsquot. All of this means, by definition, that Scotland leaving the UK would be more complicated than the UK leaving the EU, which, by extension, means the negotiations on independence could be even more hideous and confrontational than those on Brexit.Except in one happy respect: the dferences between the UK and the EU mean that there would, definitely, thankfully, be no equivalent to the backstop crisisScotland became independent because there isnrsquot a part of Scotland that would need to be treated dferently in the way Northern Ireland does. Scotland, geographically and politically, would be leaving the UK as a single whole country. Therefore, no Scottish backstop required, to the considerable relief of everyone.However, the absence of a backstop is not the same as an invisible border with England. Assuming Brexit goes ahead, the UK would be out of the single market and could restrict immigration from the EU. Equally, assuming Scotland joins the EU as an independent state, it would be following the four freedoms, including freedom of movement - therefore there would have to be checks at the Scottish border. Which leads to another of the lessons amid the chaos of Brexit: putting up barriers at borders is bad for the economy and the same would apply to Scotland.The other clues from the Brexit process are just as troubling, particularly on how the negotiations might go. Part of the problem for Theresa May has been that the EU is bigger and more powerful than the UK so the EU states have been able to dominate the negotiations and the same could apply to Scottish independence ndash the UK would be the bigger party and could end up imposing a deal thatrsquos bad for Scotland.Read more: Former Yes chief: Indyref coming down the trackAnd thatrsquos before we come to the political isions within Scotland itself. With Brexit, wersquove seen a minority government led by Mrs May thatrsquos paralysed by the split between hard and soft Brexiters and is reliant on a small party, the DUP, to get a deal through. But Nicola Sturgeon could find herself in a similar situation, except that the isions in her case would be between hard and soft nationalists arguing over how close to stay to the UK.Itrsquos also likely that, in trying to get any deal through Holyrood, the SNP would be reliant on a small party just as Mrs May is with the DUP, except that Mrs Sturgeon would be reliant on winning over hard nationalists in the Green party. The extreme Brexiters may have been the gremlins in the electrics of Brexit, but you can bet that,the SNP ever won a referendum on independence, there would be a similar type of hard Scottish nationalist pushing for an absolute form of separation. And the ldquoJacob Rees-Mogg in this situation, the ring-leader of the hard separatists, could be the leader of the Greens Patrick Harvie .All of these clues point to a dficult time after a vote for Scottish independence, quite apart from the fact that the dferences between the UK and the EU make another referendum dubious anyway ndash whatever Nicola Sturgeon and Keith Brown may have been hinting at over the weekend, the UK does not need permission to leave the EU, whereas Scotland has to get consent to leave the UK.Brexit has also taught us what happens when referendums are won by a slim margin. The argument goes on. Therersquos bitterness and chaos. The losers in the referendum keep pushing for another vote. The isions become deeper, and the wounds ooze more poison. This is precisely what has happened in the last two years over Brexit but take a close look at the chaos and you can see that itrsquos also what could happen to Scottish independence."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire council seeking government help over private water supplies","story":"Aberdeenshire Council is to write to the Scottish Environment Minister to seek urgent help in getting more North-east homes with private water supplies connected to the mains network.Having helped some  homes which suffered serious water shortages last year, the local authority said it was mindful that  may not be a “one-off event”.Last year’s dry weather, reported officers, was “unprecedented” in terms of the extent of problems for private water supplies.The £, the council spent on providing intermediate bulk containers and bottled water for those in need, is currently being reclaimed from the Scottish Government.And latest surveys indicate that although no properties are currently being assisted by the council, water table levels remain at levels “much lower” than would be expected at this time of year.Members of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee unanimously agreed that chair Peter Argyle write to Roseanna Cunningham seeking both the assistance of the Scottish Government and Scottish Water to mitigate against future shortages.They heard that Aberdeenshire has more than , properties – both domestic and non-domestic – which rely on private water supplies – the largest number of any local authority area in Scotland.While the upkeep of private water supplies is the responsibility of the property owner or landowner, supplies are vulnerable to fluctuations in quality and quantity, and are often not adequately maintained.In his letter to Ms Cunningham, Councillor Argyle states: “The public supply has many advantages over private water supplies and the overall aim should be to see as many properties as possible connected to the mains network.“The mains network should be extended to enable connections to be made, thereby reducing the number of properties on private supplies.“While it is recognised that it will not be possible to connect all properties to the public supply there are particular clusters of properties where it would be possible to do so.”The council also wants to see property owners being better educated in terms of water usage and a simplication of Scottish Water’s process forthose wishing to connect to the mains.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Climate Week North East is back to inspire you from March -\"  Climate Week North East offers range of events to inspire viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire foodbank gets a cash boost","story":"A local foodbank which fed , people last year, has received a welcome cash injection of more than #.Aberdeenshire North Foodbank, which has centres in Ellon and Inverurie, was given £ from the proceeds of a fundraising Burns Supper held in Udny Green.Burns Supper organisers, Jeannie Price and Louise McGregor, handed over the cheque to foodbank manager, Debbie Rennie.Jeannie said: “We were blown away by the generosity of local businesses and iniduals who supported our event, and we are so pleased to be able to present this worthwhile local charity with such a sizeable amount.”Collecting the cheque, the foodbank’s manager Debbie said: “We are absolutely delighted to receive this signicant donation for the foodbank. “We are so lucky to have local people who support us and can’t thank Jeannie, Louise and all of those who attended and supported the Burns Supper enough.“This type of donation means so much more than just money.

If cattle react aggressively, release your dog and take the shortest, safest route out of the field.The Scottish Outdoor Access Code website provides more information, including online video tutorials covering everything from teaching a dog to be relaxed around livestock through to dog walker etiquette and legal responsibilities.Dog behaviourist and trainer Natalie Light said: “These videos are packed full of great tips that will give dog owners the information and skills to have fun and safe walks in Scotland’s outdoors as well as understand their rights and responsibilities under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.“I hope they encourage everyone to get involved and have the confidence to enjoy getting out and about with their pets this spring.”Farmers and other land managers are also encouraged to support responsible access with dogs by following the guidance in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, for example by avoiding putting sheep close to lambing in fields with well-used routes, or indicating reasonable alternatives. If necessary, local access officers can also provide advice.More information is available on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Since Vladimir Putin ed to the Kremlin in , he has set Russia on a collision course with the West. He wants to weaken the Atlantic alliance, to ide Nato, and to undermine the European Union. He is particularly interested in small European states, whether established or aspirant, and sees them as weak links in the Euro-Atlantic community, vulnerable to Russia’s malign influence.Putin believes the post-Cold War international order is unfair. This idea is not new or his alone, but it has assumed heightened importance as Russia’s oil-fuelled economic growth rates of the early s have been replaced by recession and stagnation. No longer able to generate domestic legitimacy through what he does at home, Putin has sought to generate it through what he does abroad. This is why Scotland matters to Russia.Russia’s interest in Scotland is derived, in part, from its geostrategic location. As the location of the British nuclear base in Faslane, Scotland houses the submarines that still provide much of Nato Europe’s nuclear umbrella. In addition, the waters off Scotland’s north-west coast form part of the Greenland-Iceland-UKGap, the principal choke point between Russia’s Northern Fleet in the Arctic and its strategic interests in the North Atlantic.: Russia’s aggression should worry all who believe in democracy – Stewart McDonald MPDuring the Cold War, the GIUK Gap was probably the most carefully observed stretch of ocean on the planet, but its international importance fell dramatically after the Soviet Union collapsed. Now, as Russia has become more assertive, its prominence has ed and the UK is scrabbling to recover its capabilities there. At the same time, the Kremlin’s interest in Trident never went away.Only this month a Russian naval vessel entered the Moray Firth, forcing the Royal Navy to deploy a warship to monitor its movements. Again and again, Russian aircraft have come close to Scottish air space, forcing RAF Typhoons to scramble from Lossiemouth to mark their presence and escort them away.But the Kremlin’s interest in Scotland is not simply military, rather it is more insidious. In the Scottish nationalist movement, Russia sees a proxy to weaken and ide the UK, which has long been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side. Britain has been a leading advocate for standing firm against Russia’s aggressions from Syria to Ukraine. Provoking tensions within the UK would weaken the country politically, strategically, and militarily, reducing London’s ability to frustrate Russia’s international ambitions.The Kremlin has already developed a sophisticated and well-coordinated arsenal of techniques to ide and dominate small European countries, including: the targeted use of corruption electoral interference use of social media to affect public opinion cyber-attacks and, covert information operations. There are signs that some of these have been rolled out in Scotland.: SNP defence policy to close ‘open door’ to RussiaIn , Edinburgh University established a Russian study centre, funded by the Russkiy Mir Foundation. The Foundation was created by Putin in , is funded from Russia’s federal budget, and aims to both challenge Western views and promote Russia’s position on global issues. Four years later, Russia sent a delegation of pro-Kremlin electoral observers to monitor Scotland’s independence referendum. The lead observer, Igor Borisov, concluded that the vote “[did] not conform to generally accepted international principles of referendums”. This was quickly repeated in a Facebook group called “Rally for a Revote”, which was linked to a petition that collected over , signatures and was heavily promoted by pro-Russian Twitter accounts.In , Sputnik, a mouthpiece of the Kremlin, established its UK headquarters in Edinburgh. The following year, Alex Salmond, the former First Minister of Scotland, was given his own show on RT, the Russian government’s propaganda channel. Last year, meanwhile, Scottish Limited Partnerships were implicated in the so-called Russian Laundromat scandal, a vast money laundering scheme in which up to £ billion of illicit funds were funnelled out of Russia in the early s.No surprises then, that London has started to take Russia’s interests in Scotland seriously. The UK now views Russia as a “tier one” national security threat, just as it viewed the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It has adopted a ‘Fusion Doctrine’ to counter Russia’s hybrid warfare, and is investing in nine P- Poseidon aircraft, in order to monitor activity across the North Atlantic, which will be housed at RAF Lossiemouth.So too has Edinburgh. Members of the Scottish National Party are engaging with their counterparts in allied countries where in Europe, not least in the Baltic, to learn how small states can respond to Russia’s meddling – particularly under Nato’s umbrella.But there is a strange irony, here. The SNP foresees an independent Scotland’s admission to Nato at the same time that it opposes the hosting of British nuclear submarines in Scottish waters. Yet, it is precisely these submarines that provide Nato’s nuclear deterrence in Europe. This would lay down a curious marker: the dominant party in an independent Scotland would jeopardise Nato at the same time that it sought its protection.Worse, it would jeopardise the security of other small states – from Estonia to Iceland – that also depend on Nato.Dr Andrew Foxall is director of the Russia and Eurasia Studies Centre and James Rogers is director of the Global Britain Programme, both at the Henry Jackson Society, an international affairs think tank©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"leader sturgeon should stick to cautious indyref2 strategy","story":"It may well be true that Nicola Sturgeon has the power as First Minister of Scotland to hold a second independence referendum #not to actually act on a Yes vote # as constitutional experts believe. But just because one has the power to do something, does not necessarily mean it should be done.Before the EU referendum, we perhaps had a dferent idea about the consequences of major constitutional change. What we have learned from the vote for Brexit is that it is likely to be a protracted, acrimonious and highly complicated process – with huge controversies breaking out over previously overlooked factors.Scottish independence is unlikely to be any dferent. Had Scotland voted Yes in , it’s likely we’d still be arguing over how to split up the UK’s resources and debts, cross-border trade and tax issues.Surely, the clear lesson from Brexit – and Theresa May’s fundamental mistake in pandering to hardliners in her own party, rather than seek agreement from Remainers willing to accept the result – is that,such momentous changes are to work, consensus is vital.Nicola Sturgeon has called for “pragmatism and patience” from supporters, with SNP sources indicating the party will not seek another referendum until the polls show consistent support for independence of about  per cent. She has also stressed she would not hold a referendum without Westminster’s backing.She is absolutely right. If Scotland is to hold another referendum – and many people think this isn’t the right time – it must be done in a calm, orderly way. Catalonia’s disputed referendum was a mistake Scotland should not repeat. Any new nation born amid ision among its own populace and hostility from its neighbours is unlikely to prosper and its people would be the ones who paid the price. Whether you agree with her or not, Sturgeon’s brand of liberal nationalism is sensible and canny. Let’s hope she sticks to it and declines to exercise the power the experts say she has.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm after brexit watch slick tories self destruct","story":"The collapse of cabinet responsibility is a taste of the civil war to come once Brexit has been dealt with, writes Euan McColmThe one thing you could always say about the Conservative Party was that, no matter how ided it might seem, it knew how to do unity when the occasion demanded.Think back to  and the campaign to replace David Cameron as leader. For a while, Andrea Leadsom looked like having a decent chance at winning and her supporters were perfectly brutal in their assessment of the main challenger.When Leadsom dropped out of the contest after a car-crash newspaper interview in which she seemed to say the fact she was a parent made her the superior candidate, her former supporters threw themselves at the feet of Theresa May.It’s dficult to imagine now, but for the briefest moment, the new Prime Minister had the backing of a united Conservative Party.But  is a foreign country where things were done dferently. Now, the Tories are split as never before and it is not at all clear that anyone – whether May or any of the MPs tipped to replace her – can bring them together again.The latest in a series of incidents that underline just how weak the Prime Minister’s grip on her party is came during a fraught series of votes last week during which four cabinet ministers defied the government whip to abstain on a decision to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. The quartet had been under strict orders to oppose the move and their defiance should have cost them their front-bench roles.Instead, their contempt for May was – despite the anger of some colleagues – meekly accepted. The Prime Minister grinds on, supported by her secretaries of state as the hanged man is supported by the noose.It was dficult to disagree with Nigel Evans, executive secretary of the  Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, when he said that, without collective responsibility, government “simply doesn’t work”.If Evans and those who sympathise with him are waiting for action to be taken against Greg Clark, David Gauke, David Mundell and Amber Rudd, they will be waiting for a very long time.It appears inevitable that Brexit – scheduled to take place on the th of this month – will be delayed. Last week the Prime Minister may have maintained her line that she hoped the UK would depart the EU – with a deal in place – on schedule, but that, surely, went beyond the normal boundaries of optimism.May is, perfectly understandably, blamed by colleagues and opponents alike for the current political crisis engulfing this foolish nation.It is certainly true that this stf, awkward and blinkered politician hasn’t helped. She has failed to reach out across the Brexit ide, instead focusing her efforts on placating hardline Tory Eurosceptics. For almost three years, this vocal minority on the Conservative benches has had the upper hand.But anyone who thinks a dferent leader might, even now, be overseeing a smooth – and broadly popular – departure from the European Union is kidding themselves.Arch bullshitters on the Leave side of the argument – former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab, for example – might splutter about missed opportunities and poor strategy but their version of events has a compliant European Union offering solutions to any and all downsides of Brexit because of the confidence of Eurosceptics. Other Leavers, such as backbench reactionary Jacob Rees-Mogg, blithely insist that a no-deal Brexit would be fine and the PM should just get on with things.One doesn’t have to be an admirer of Theresa May to accept that an alternative leader would be in just as tricky a place right now.For more than four decades, the Conservative Party has been ided over Europe. A minority of elected members have obsessed over the issue, giving it top priority. While the European question remained unanswered, it was possible for successive Tory leaders to declare their party a “broad church” with room for dferent views on the subject.But the party of today can no longer comfortably accommodate politicians of such wildly dfering views. And when Brexit is, finally, done and dusted, it will remain split.When David Cameron became Tory leader in , he promised a new, more compassionate, more moderate party. Just as Tony Blair had done with Labour a decade before, Cameron would bring the Conservatives up to date.This new version of the Tory Party had wide appeal, attracting, as it did, new candidates who looked nothing like Conservatives of old. Signicant figures such as Scottish party leader Ruth Davidson joined because of Cameron. But just as Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour is, bizarrely, obsessed with distancing itself from the Blair revolution which turned the party into an election-winning force, so the Brexiteers who hold sway over the Prime Minister are desperately keen to forget the modernising efforts of Cameron.I wonder whether any senior Tory politician truly believes that their party can unite again in the near future. Can anyone foresee an election campaign which sees, say, remainer Nicky Morgan stand shoulder to shoulder with Rees-Mogg  Is there a church broad enough to contain two such dferent figures with two such dfering ideologies If anything now unites the Conservative group at Westminster, it is the Labour Party. Polls might show a Tory lead, but they also showed one in , before May called the snap election that cost her her parliamentary majority. Conservative MPs’ fear of a general election is palpable.And so the Conservative Party rattles on, hopelessly split and – perhaps – irreparably damaged. There will come a day when Brexit is resolved. I don’t expect that day to bring with it a new era of Tory unity. The European question, for so long the source of Tory tension, has now hopelessly ided the party.The Conservative Party is held together by the fear of a Labour election win. That’s hardly the basis from which to built a bright new political future.Once Brexit is out of the way, watch any last semblance of Tory unity melt away. If the Conservatives are to survive in the long term, they require a civil war and one side – either Leaver or Remainer – requires to lose decisively.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon asked to apologise for disgraceful comment","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has been asked to apologise to a serving police officer after she branded his comments about public sector pay rises as #disgraceful#.Her remarks came in response to a letter read out by Scottish Conservative MSP Graham Simpson at today’s First Minister’s Questions.The letter from an East Kilbride policeman questioned why officers received a smaller pay rise than teachers or NHS staff.He askedpolice were regarded as an “easy target” because they are barred from taking industrial action and questioned the value the Scottish Government placed on the police service.This year’s pay offer for police was . per cent compared with . per cent for teachers and nine per cent for NHS workers.But the First Minister hit back at the suggestion, and said: “Parts of those comments were quite disgraceful actually. I value all public sector workers and I thank them for the work that they do.“On the police pay award - that is the best award for police officers anywhere in the UK and the Scottish Police Federation said it was the best award in  years.”She added: “If the member thinks . per cent is not good enough... then I wonder what he makes of the two per cent that has been awarded to police officers in England by his Tory colleagues in the Westminster government, I think described by the head of the Met as a punch in the nose for police officers ”Later, Mr Simpson said the First Minister should apologise for her remarks in Holyrood.He said: “Nicola Sturgeon should be taking the concerns of a serving police officer extremely seriously. Instead, in front of Scotland’s parliament, she branded him a disgrace.“It’s no wonder officers are losing faith in this SNP government with that kind of attitude. These brave and hardworking police officers should not be discriminated against because they don’t threaten to go on strike.“The First Minister needs to apologise for being so dismissive of his concerns.”In the letter, the anonymous officer said: “Why has such a massive importance been placed on the pay rise for school teachers when other public service staff are not being awarded nearly as much as a pay rise “Does the Scottish Government place the value of police officers as only half that of school teachers  Is it that the Government know that because police officers cannot strike or take any real industrial action that they are an easy target ”A spokesman for the First Minister later said that she would not apologise as her \"disgraceful\" comment was not directed at the police officer but at Graham Simpson.During First Ministers Questions, Mr Simpson was booed by SNP backbenchers as he read out the letter, and asked what Nicola Sturgeon would say to the officer and “thousands of others” like him.Ms Sturgeon went on to say: “In terms of our NHS workers many get higher pay in Scotland than they do in England because of the value we attach to the work that they do.“In terms of teachers they have now been offered an exceptionally good pay deal and I think that is recognition of the good work that they do and I hope that is now accepted.“But I value all public sector workers and I thinkyou look at any group of public sector workers you will find that the value attached to them by the Scottish Government is much much greater than the value attached to their counterparts in England by the Tory government at Westminster.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"highland council to engage in keep left campaign through two year","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Highland Council is to engage in a two-year programme of painting directional arrows on roads to remind tourists to drive on the left.During a recent area committee meeting in Portree, Gordon MacDonald, Highland Council#s roads manager, told local councillors that the scheme would begin in April .

Also little ones can get creative and make a sheep brooch, a rainbow mobile or a snake to take home on the day as well as having their face painted.You might even get the opportunity to get a selfie with St Patrick himself.As well as the “flesh and blood” version the entertainment hub will be host to a beautul hand carved wooden statue of the one-time Slemish shepherd.It was carved by Miguel Frederico Neves and stands over ft tall.There will be no parking at Slemish, Carnstroan Road or Carnstroan Lane, so a free park and ride service will operate from the former Michelin plant, Broughshane, just off the M.The shuttle bus to Slemish Mountain will run continually from am – :pm stopping in Broughshane village so nobody will miss out on the free entertainment and shopping offers.The one and a half kilometre walk at Slemish takes approximately one hour up and down and it is strongly advised that suitable clothing and strong footwear is worn.Sections of the short climb can be steep and slippery and might not be suitable for all.For those who would enjoy an easier trek than Slemish, a gentle riverside walk from Raceview Mill takes visitors past the Raceview hedgehog habitat and along the beautul river Braid as it meanders around the village. Come rain or shine, Broughshane and District Community Association will be providing the hub of entertainment on Saturday  March with fun for all the family to enjoy.

The phone hasnt stopped. I have also had wonderful support locally with everyone congratulating me.”Vera, who is inspired by her love of nature, has been designing, making and restoring jewellery for over  years.Born in the Czech Republic Vera, moved to London where she worked for four years at Hatton Garden Jewellers.Vera met her husband in London and after a couple of years the couple decided to move to Northern Ireland.Vera set up her own studio and has been hard at work designing and creating bespoke jewellery.

The scheme has provided an opportunity for The Carson Project, Dunclug Youth Forum and Doury Road Development Group to explore the potential of working together to help embed good relations and peace building at a local level and to build upon work done to date.One member of the audience, better qualied than most in terms of judging audience response at The Braid is Council Arts Officer Rosalind Lowry and she admitted she was blown away by the performance and the audience reaction.What a fantastic atmosphere, she said. The BRAID project organisers deserve huge congratulations for the concert - it was fabulous.And the appreciation was not a one-way street with Garda band leader Pat Kenny saying: Im delighted everyone enjoyed the concert.The warmth that came from the audience was something I will cherish for a very long time. Please give my regards to all and God willing we will all meet again.Sandy Wilson of North Antrim Community Network echoed the thoughts of many who attended when he made special mention of Ballymenas Colum Best, a major driving force behind the evening.He said: Congratulations - mainly to youfor your vision about hosting the concert and to the other community people involved.It was a truly enjoyable and memorable evening for everyone and i think two standing ovations at the end said it all. We really enjoyed the singers as well , they really added to the talent and iety of the musical performance. Well done to all ! Colum admitted he was almost overwhelmed by the response. He told the : It was out of this world and people leaving at end of night were saying that it was the best concert they had ever been at. “I have never seen an audience cheer as loud or stand up to applaud so much .. the place was really rocking. I am lost for words and do not know how to thank everyone involved enough.

Since then emergency repairs have been undertaken as the building had been unoccupied for a number of years following the deaths of Jim and Sally Gillen, Gracehill’s last postmasters. Happily, a full scheme of restoration is now underway. The first phase will see the building of new chimneys, the replacement of the roof and rainwater goods and repairs to the windows. The building is historically very signicant as it was a purpose built shop constructed for the Settlement in . It is two storey with attics and basement and the layout is much as it was when originally constructed. The central shop area still contains many original features including shelving built into the walls, counters and a large wooden winch wheel for drawing stores up to the attic. Speaking about the restoration David Johnston, chairman of the Trust said: The aim is to restore this unique building so visitors can once again experience what le might have been like in the nineteenth century. “Holiday accommodation with a period theme will also be provided and a tea room will complete the scheme to ensure the future of this wonderful and historic building and hopefully the roof will be good for another  years!

It honours the UK’s solemn commitments in the Belfast Good Friday Agreement.“If we ever have to use that insurance policy, it cannot become a permanent arrangement and it is not a template for our future relationship.“The deal that MPs voted on in January was not strong enough in making that clear and legally-binding changes were needed to set that right. We have now agreed them.“The EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely which can be challenged.“Now it is time to come together and back this improved deal.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the new agreements were an “unambiguous statement” of both sides’ “good faith and intentions” but also made it clear they did not undermine the principle of the backstop.“We have insisted that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be rewritten, and that the backstop arrangement, while intended to be temporary, must continue to apply unless and until it is replaced by future arrangements that can achieve the same objective, namely no hard border,” he said.“However, we have also said that we were prepared to offer guarantees and further reassurances and to the UK of our good faith and intentions – indeed we have offered such reassurances on many occasions.“The Instrument agreed yesterday puts those assurances on a legal footing and represents an unambiguous statement by both parties of what has been agreed. “It does not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, or undermine the backstop or its application. “It says that we will work together, in good faith, in pursuit of a future relationship that ensures that the objectives of the Protocol, particularly the need to avoid a hard border, are met. “The documents agreed yesterday reiterate our wish to establish a future partnership with the UK that is as close as possible, and marks our commitment to ensure that negotiations on that future relationship can begin as soon as the UK leaves. “The instrument agreed sets out how we will go about this important work. “In many ways, Brexit has been a dark cloud over us for many months, and particularly the threat of no deal. A positive vote tonight can remove that cloud and restore confidence and optimism in Britain, Ireland and across the European Union. “We now need to see the Withdrawal Agreement ratied by Westminster and by the European Parliament without further delay, so that we can get on with the important work of building the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, and between the UK and Ireland, post Brexit. “I know feel that for the remains of the day, we need to give MPs in Westminster the time and space to consider what#s now on the table.” All eyes now turn to UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox who will later today give his considered assessment of whether what Mrs May has secured is legally binding. His response is expected to be key in deciding what way Brexit hardliners – notably Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ERG and the DUP – will vote this evening.

But now, it seems the only paths are to see a catastrophic no deal outcome, the Government working across the House of Commons to find a softer version of Brexit, or reconsidering Brexit in its entirety,# she said.“In the short run, taking a no deal off the table must be the immediate priority. In itself and without a clear plan, this resolves nothing. The House of Commons is good at saying what it is against, but can’t manage to give a clear answer on what it is for. But the UK is too close to the clf-edge and every day of uncertainty sees more and more economic and social damage.“The clearest, most coherent and most democratic route through this impasse lies with a People’s Vote, including both the Prime Minister’s deal and the Remain option. This needs to be tested in Parliament as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sentence overturned for man carrying flag","story":"AN IRSP activist who was convicted for carrying a flag during a Falls Road Easter commemoration has had his sentence overturned.In December last year, West Belfast man Sean Carlin was given a four-month suspended sentence for carrying a historical replica of an INLA Belfast Battalion flag during the commemoration in .The parade had been themed to honour local members who had lost their lives during attacks on the organisation following a  split. However, in what is believed to be the first case of its kind, Sean was subsequently arrested and convicted under the Terrorism Act  for carrying the flag in circumstances that state authorities deemed to arouse suspicion that he is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation.This week, Sean revealed that his suspended sentence had been quashed with a £ fine issued in its stead following a court appeal against the earlier ruling.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sean said: “From the start of this I was of the opinion that no matter what the outcome of the case was that I was going to be fighting it. If I was convicted, and eventually was convicted, then the benchmark was set and would have big repercussions for republicans right across the board. The point we made was that this was a commemorative event. It was advertised as a commemorative event so we were trying to unravel the agenda of the PPS and the cops.“We’ve been of the opinion that, this is all because we didn’t buy into the Fresh Start Agreement,” he added.“The IRSP has been getting hounded since then. This flag issue was just another signicant push in relation to criminalising the IRSP. On a personal level, I couldn’t accept carrying a flag to commemorate your dead being a criminal offence – it’s unheard of.”Sean’s solicitor, Michael Brentnall, said that while the case has “set the benchmark” in terms of sentencing, the legislation surrounding the conviction stands to be challenged.“I think it’s signicant, particularly the judges remarks at the end, who stated that no person in Ireland should go to jail for carrying a flag in Ireland. That’s signicant in itself and it has set the benchmark for how these matters be dealt with. We’re now seeking senior council’s opinion on whether there is a point of law that can be taken to the court of appeal on the basis of the conviction alone rather than just the sentence.” He continued: “Each case is facts specic, but in Sean’s case it was said during proceedings that every case of somebody carrying a similar flag to a commemoration could be criminalised. Sean was the only person this had been enforced against – there’s an issue with that in itself, but then Sean’s barrister made the point that this was a clear breach of freedom of expression and the sanction was entirely excessive in relation to the context of what had happened.”He added: “Another point that we still have to explore is that the legislation is very vague. The legislation says that you can be a supporter or a member of a proscribed organisation. If this is a means of circumventing membership charges and having somebody landed with a charge then that’s a dferent fight.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37922289.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Sinn_Fein_Tweet.jpg","title":"explanation demanded from sinn fein leader mary lou mcdonald over england get out of ireland banner","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It demonstrated that bigotry and hypocrisy were alive and well within their version of republicanism.“It is clear that when Sinn Fein talk about respect, honesty and integrity, that they are as sincere as Gerry Adams using equality as a Trojan Horse to attack unionists.

Mary Lou McDonald showed incredibly poor judgement to pose behind it and she should apologise.\"Leaving aside the irony of St Patrick being a Briton, this sort of anti-English, anti-British sentiment is just as repulsive as anti-Irish, anti-immigrant prejudiced views - they are two sides of the same coin.\"Former Victims Commissioner Patricia MacBride told the BBC NIs Sunday Politics programme that she understood the sign gained prominence in New York in the early s.\"I think it came to the fore during the daily protests outside the British Consulate in New York City during the hunger strikes in ,\" she said.\"I think the sign was very much of its time and needs to be consigned to history at this point in time and moving forward.\"It really is needed.

It is not too late to get real change to the backstop. It would be absurd to hold the vote before that has even been attempted.”Former Brexit secretary David Davis, who backed the deal last week, told The Times he might change his mind: “If they have not answered the Northern Ireland question properly I might not vote for it this time.“I took them on trust last week. But now they have got to solve the problem.”Bolton West MP Chris Green told BBC Radio ’s Westminster Hour: “I want to vote against it because I don’t believe when Parliament defeated it by the biggest margin in the history of Parliament that was because it was in any way a good deal, and the substance of the deal hasn’t changed.”But he added that a sht in the DUP’s position would have a “big impact” and the implications of rejecting the deal for a third time weighed heavily on him “because it could lead to a general election, and we don’t know how that will pan out”.Other Tories made clear that the price for support could be Mrs May saying she will quit once the deal is through.Conservative MP for Dover Charlie Elphicke said there needs to be “a change of leadership” in order for him to support the deal, telling BBC Sunday Politics South East we need “a new face and a new team to take us forward to the future relationship”.Former Cabinet minister Esther McVey told the BBC: “She needs a dignied departure.”Fellow Tory Andrew Bridgen told The Sunday Times: “I’ve been approached by whips offering the PM’s resignationI vote her deal through.”Ribble Valley MP Nigel Evans said Mrs May would have to gothere was a y delay to Brexit.“She promised to become Prime Minister to deliver what the . million people voted for, that is what she has to deliver andshe can’t do that, she has to go.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will have a series of meetings with other Westminster leaders including the SNP’s Ian Blackford and Liberal Democrat Sir Vince Cable and influential backbenchers in an effort to find a consensus on a rival Brexit strategy.The Opposition could back an amendment to the deal calling for it to be pushed to a referendum, although Mr Corbyn said he was “not supporting Theresa May’s deal at all”.Mr Corbyn said his meetings this week were “what the Government should have started two years ago – namely reach out, engage and listen to dferent views and find a consensus on Brexit which helps bring our country back together”."},{"url":null,"title":"drogba and cafu go headtohead in game with special olympics athletes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As coach Liam Dwyer told the Press Association of the game: “Yeah, it has some signicant history doesn’t it ”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  “Everyone at home likes to beat the Germans because of the World Cup!” said midfielder and forward Tom Ward from St Albans.Meanwhile for Reece Johnson, a midfielder, the chance to get involved in the rivalry in a competition fixture was welcome.“Whenever England play Germany it’s always a big game,” he said. “So it felt good to have a good competitive game against them.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Meanwhile the quality of both teams means that comparisons between the international scene and the Special Olympic arena are valid – while this GB team are one of the favourites for gold, Germany represent one of their trickiest challenges.“I knew the game was going to be tough because Germany are quite a good team, quite tough, so it was a physical game,” said Derek Taylor.Indeed, a - result full of big tackles and a late flurry of chances confirmed how evenly matched these sides were in the seven-a-side arena.“I’m very happy with the draw,” said goalkeeper Sean McCulloch. “This was the hardest gameI would think at the moment.”Game  of the group @SOGreatBritain - SO Germany. Two very organised teams that cancelled each other out. If we don’t lose our next game we will be playing for gold! Aussies are up next!— Bobby ColtmanMarch , But while plenty of the rivalry seems to translate to this World Games fixture, the Special Olympics movement gives it its own flavour, combining a will to win with respect and the forging of new relationships.“We showed respect for them, handshakes at the end of the match,” said McCulloch, who swapped one of his World Games badges with an opponent at full time.“It doesn’t matter what rivalry it is. As long as everybody’s together.”Meanwhile, those sentiments were reflected in the crowd of friends, family and fans who were sat together watching from the stand.“In the crowd the German supporters and the British supporters were all having a laugh together, chanting together and all sorts,” said Ward’s father Steve. “There was no animosity. It was just a friendly atmosphere and it’s the same with the players. They all came off together – not as two teams, but together.”And while building new friendships doesn’t necessarily take priority over victories, make no mistake: there is more than one way to leave this tournament a winner.“I think we’ve got a very good chance of winning gold,” said Johnson. “But evenwe don’t, we’ve made new friends and that’s what matters.”"},{"url":null,"title":"social media users reveal best sleeptalk they have overheard","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Having such high-tech equipment available locally would mean many people from the area would not have to travel long distances to have their tests carried out where, Mr McGrath continued.ldquoSuch a scan can be a worrying time and the fact that people have to travel to other places for the scan adds to the anxiety.Cllr Trainor said a mobile scanner currently in place at the Downe to ease pressure at the Ulster Hospital will only be there for a few more weeks.ldquoDoes this fact not make the business case for the local health trust, too many people using the current scanner at the Ulster so one is required at the Downe  he asked.ldquoI hope local health officials will hurry up with their administrative work required to progress the business case to provide an MRI scanner in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"City deals could bring finanacial boost for Newcastle  ","story":"PLANS to deliver a signicant multi-million pound tourism bonanza in Newcastle have taken an important step forward this week.Highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort are among the key projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector which have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.On Monday, members of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee agreed to sign a heads of agreement deal which paves the way for work to start on outline business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal which includes the Mournes Gateway project.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case and financial plans could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.And while the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The Newcastle tourism project was a key part of the city deal which has secured a near poundbn investment package from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.And while talks continue to secure cash under the city deal initiative, local council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for its other aspects and move the ious projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The tourism schemersquos other proposals include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.

There is also concern about the surface of the existing car park which is particularly uneven and the absence of adequate parking for visitors with young families.The access from the car park to the beach for families pushing prams is described as ldquounsuitable with the financial spend approved at Mondayrsquos meeting designed to improve the overall visitor experience, create a better first impression, improve the car park surface and the number of available spaces.New directional signs are also proposed, with council officials warning failure to address the issues could result in the loss of blue flag status, result in a negative visitor experience, reduced visitor numbers and income.To progress the improvement work, council officials have agreed to appoint a contractor to design a scheme.The planned investment has been welcomed by Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran.He said he was pleased local authority officials have recognise the need to improve Tyrella to ensure it continues to attract a high number of visitors, particularly from April and September.ldquoTyrella is an extremely popular beach, he said. ldquoIt is highly regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos top beaches and it is vital it retains its blue flag status. We rely heavily upon tourism in our area and we need to ensure our beaches are up to standard.Cllr Curran says he has no doubt that investing in Tyrella is not only ldquogood news for the district and visitors to the area, but will produce an economic idend through increased use.He continued: ldquoWe are fortunate to have stunning beaches like Tyrella, Kilclief and Ballyhornan on our doorstep. Those who work to keep our bathing waters clean and, more importantly, up to an internationally recognised standard so they are safe to use, do a terric job.Cllr Curran said picturesque beaches helped make up the ldquounique fabric of Lecale and the surrounding area and were a vital tourism resource.He added: ldquoThe planned investment at Tyrella is a good news story and I am pleased that the local authority is not content to sit back on its laurels but recognises the importance of continuing investment in a wealth of tourism assets right across the entire district.ldquoDown District is lucky to be blessed with such priceless resources which can make a valuable contribution to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike.

No one thought this was going to happen.Mrs Trainor believes the Downe is capable of accommodating both ENT day surgery and the proposed cataract service, given that it is relatively modern hospital, boasting a range of high tech, diagnostic equipment and theatres.She added: ldquoIt simply beggars belief that we are to lose a key day surgery for people with ear, nose and throat problems. The loss is compounded by the fact that local hospital campaigners were not informed this was happening or asked for their views.Last week, a South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed there were no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Farmers opposed to geopark plans  ","story":"PLANS to secure world renowned tourism branding for an area stretching from Strangford Lough to South Armagh have been dealt a major blow this week.As Newry, Mourne and Down Council prepares to submit a bid to secure prestigious UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union has labelled the proposal a ldquonon starter.Consultants have been working on the councilrsquos bid for geopark status ahead of a formal application being made this November.Supporters of the ambitious plan insist that securing geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geopark branding is one of the key planks of the local authorityrsquos tourism strategy with those involved in the process confident it has the potential to increase the number of international visitors to the area.However, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union mdash whose representatives met recently with local authority officials and representatives from Geological Survey NI mdash says farmers are ldquounanimously opposed to the geopark.While it has been suggested that securing geopark branding could potentially be worth in the region of poundm for local tourism, the farmersrsquo union says it is ldquofar from impressed at the assertion that the designation will bring increased recreational opportunities and promote social inclusion.UFU deputy president Victor Chestnutt said farmers in the Newry, Mourne and Down area were were ldquofar from impressed with promises made by officials they met recently.The UFU official continued: ldquoI would like to remind these officials that farmers have been the custodians of the land for hundreds of years. Imposing a designation on this area will affect their livelihoods which will have a knock-on effect on all ratepayers in the area.ldquoCouncil officials believe and are promoting that this designation will not restrict the operations of any farmer. This is unrealistic and their approach is disappointing.ldquoWe are % opposed to these plans and I would urge the council to meet our members, listen to their concerns and reconsider their plans to progress with such an application.Mr Chestnutt is encouraging local authority officials to provide figures to UFU members to support claims that geopark branding will help grow farm businesses, confirming that until farmers see the figures in black and white, they will continue to dispute any such claims.The UFU vice-president said with local government elections fastapproaching, the organisation believes the time is right to review any proposed geopark application.He continued: ldquoThe UFU has made contact with each of the parties and all independent councillors who currently hold seats on Newry, Mourne and Down Council and it is disappointing that only a very small number have taken the time to listen and engage with us. We have many members residing and working in the area and some councillors have missed a genuine opportunity to engage with their constituents.The senior union official said the ldquostigma around the Mournes national park debate a number of years ago is still very much at the forefront of farmersrsquo minds, explaining that at the time, UFU members were united in their opposition to the proposals.Mr Chestnutt said the UFU believed that farmers who live and work in the area should decide whether or not an area is suitable for national park or global geopark status.He said the council had put nothing on the table to reassure members and encourage them to reverse their position.With tourism one of the key drivers behind the geopark branding, Mr Chestnutt said Tourism NI was ldquovisibly absent from any discussions.He said farmers believed tourism in the area could be developed without the need to introduce a special designation.ldquoThe funding and resources the council has earmarked for the development and operation of the proposed new geopark should be redirected to the general promotion of tourism and infrastructure development. We are in favour of economic development but securing geopark status is not the way to do it, he declared.Mr Chestnutt added: ldquoOur message is simple and direct ndash farmers in the area are strongly opposed to the geopark proposal and I would urge all councillors, council officials and the Geological Survey of NI to fully and meaningfully engage with us.ldquoThe best course of action would be to rethink the geopark proposal and focus tourism investment into wider promotion of our beautul countryside.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council said the geopark had the potential to make a ldquosignicant contribution to local communities and tourism in the Mourne, Ring of Gullion and Strangford and Lecale areas.ldquoIt is important to understand that a geopark is not a legislative designation and will therefore not place any restrictions on economic activity within the proposed areas, including on any farming practices, he said.ldquoThe introduction of a geopark will not introduce additional planning restrictions and instead will simply provide an globally recognised accreditation.ldquoThe geopark will only include sites which already have public access and the geopark will not promote any access to private land, unless the landowner in question wants to work with the geopark.The spokesman added: ldquoThe process to achieve geopark designation is ongoing and it is not until  that an accreditation would be confirmed as part of this ongoing process.ldquoIn the meantime, the council will continue to deliver events and activities to increase awareness of what the project represents and how it can grow our tourism offering and support our local communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash THE Earl of Clanwilliamrsquos th century mansion and -acre estate at Montalto, Ballynahinch, officially goes on sale today.

I have to pull out onto the middle of the road before I can get a clear view of oncoming cars.He continued: ldquoA lot of the cars are driven by R drivers from the nearby Down High School. There have been problems with cars parking on the road ever since I moved in here four years ago. Irsquove tried everything in the past to get something done. Irsquove spoken to the former MP, the council, the school, the police and still itrsquos the same.ldquoIt not only affects me but the other residents and staff and anyone pushing a pram on the pavement who are forced to walk on the road as parked cars are blocking their way.Mr Stubbington likes to go into town most days when the weather is good to shop. He needs to drive down Bridge Street on the right side as his mobility scooter could over-balance on the speed bumps.His concerns about the parked cars are shared by Cedar Courtrsquos staff.One staff member, who asked not to be named, said: ldquoI nearly was cleaned in my own car a few weeks ago from trying to pull out on to the road.ldquoItrsquos a terrible problem for all of us. And not just for ourselves but also for cars and lorries going up and down the street. There are regular traffic jams out there as vehicles try to manoeuvre around the cars.A spokesman for the Department of Infrastructuresaid that it had been made aware in the past of the obstruction issue. But the Department ruled out the installation of a yellow parking line around Cedar Court.He said: ldquoAs the entrance into Cedar Court is a private entrance and does not form part of the adopted road network, the Department is unable to introduce corner waiting restrictions at this location.ldquoIt is, however, an offence to park across a private entrance, or on a footway, in such a manner to cause an obstruction, whether waiting restrictions are in place or not.ldquoIn the past officials have spoken with Down High School to highlight the issue, the last time being in October, . This previously had a positive effect and as such the Department will again speak to the school to ask pupils not to obstruct entrances and footways in a manner that causes inconvenience or danger to local residents.ldquoHowever,this parking behaviour does continue, then it should be reported to the PSNI, who have the power to address these issues.The principal of Down High School, Mrs Maud Perry, said that she was aware of the issue.ldquoThe safety of pedestrians and road users is of utmost importance. Parking around the Bridge Street and Mount Crescent area is limited, she remarked.ldquoWe do not encourage students to drive to school. When they do, students are advised through sixth-form year assemblies that there are residential homes in the area and due consideration needs to be given to that. We advise them that they should park with care and consideration and within the law and they are reminded not to park on the pavement.ldquoPupils who drive a car to school provide us with their car details. Should a complaint be left by a member of the public, we attempt to identy the driver and address the issue.Mrs Perry added that this was currently a ldquospike time of the school year for student drivers as it combined both pupils from its upper sixth year who have been driving for upwards of a year and lower sixth pupils who had recently passed their driving tests..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Posnett powers Saul to cosy win  ","story":"TEAM Saul claimed victory in the CosyRoof Winter League at St Patrickrsquos Golf Club.Saul were led by captain Phil Posnett and Donard, who they beat in the final, were headed by deputy captain captain Gerry Reilly.After poor weather on Saturday it was Saul that were quickest out of the blocks come Sunday morning with Phil and Ed Baggley snr both shooting  points.These scores were quickly followed by their team-mates Joe Deegan withand Lawrence Craig with  points.The champagne was now chilling nicely, particularly as the first two Donard scores from Gerry Reilly with  points and Bill Dunlop with  points, made no inroads into Saulrsquos  total.In the early afternoon the drama began to unfold as Joe OrsquoNeill shot an incredible  points to bring Donard within touching distance of the prize.

This is one of the reasons we all play the game. It makes all the hard work and effort worthwhile, he said.ldquoPreparations are going well. I canrsquot fault the lads, everyone is putting in a sht and getting out to training. Hopefully, all the hard work will pay off.ldquoWe donrsquot really know much about Cathair Dhiore as all year we have just concentrated on our game and what we need to do.

Everyone in the school is looking forward to it. The school is covered in maroon and gold and itrsquos just class as it sends good vibes all around the place.ldquoFormer players and coaches have been wishing us well and it has been great to see them involved as the Red High has a huge history and tradition in Ulster Collegesrsquo football.St Patrickrsquos have potential match winners all over the park and in Tim Prenter mdash a regular starter in the countyrsquos senior hurling team mdash Ruairi OrsquoHare, Brandon Boyd, Tom Smyth and Niall Laverty they have players capable of winning games on their own.Red High coach Declan Morgan believes that his charges have what it takes to go all the way this year.ldquoWe have been training exceptionally hard, but the boys enjoy the work and there is a great camaraderie in the squad, he said.ldquoThere is pace and mobility all over the pitch and we have defenders that can negate Cathair Dhoirersquos scoring threat. Our lads all know the job they have to do.

If this is the first time you have subscribed to emails from JPIMedia Ltd, the publishers of Belfast Newsletter, please check your inbox to very your email address.  .html.valThree speakers at a major gathering of Irish nationalists in Belfast less than two months ago have strongly criticised Mary Lou McDonald#s decision to promote an #England get out of Ireland# message in the US.The Waterfront conference brought more than , people, representing a wide range of nationalist and republican viewpoints, together in a display of unity in the face of the challenges posed by Brexit.However, several of those who endorsed the initiative have now distanced themselves from the Sinn Fein president’s actions – echoing the sentiments of Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney who said the message was “offensive” and “isive”.Opening the ‘Beyond Brexit: The Future of Ireland’ event on January , Belfast solicitor and event organiser Niall Murphy said: “In the challenges which will immediately confront us in the coming weeks and months we will require a unied and coherent mobilisation of broad northern nationalist and progressive voices.” After Ms McDonald posted the picture on Twitter, political commentator David McCann said the message being promoted was “completely contrary to everything that we discussed at that conference”.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood retweeted the picture of the banner and said: “Sinn Fein aren’t capable of convincing unionists of anything. The rest of us will have a lot of heavy lting to do.”Clare Bailey, the Green Party NI leader who also spoke at the Beyond Brexit conference, said the banner “calls into question her genuine commitment to equality and rights”.The South Belfast MLA added: “The sentiment is the same as that of hard Brexiteers – to sever political, social and economic connections without a second thought for the consequences.”The picture of the Sinn Fein leader was posted on Twitter with her comment: “No explanation needed.”In response, Mr Coveney said Ms McDonald should “grow up” – describing the message as “offensive, isive and an embarrassment”.Mr Coveney added: “We are better than this!”Alliance leader Naomi Long tweeted: “This banner is not just profoundly stupidbut it sends out a hostile and offensive message to anyone English or of English extraction on this island. Respect, Equality, Integrity anyone ”Lisburn and Castlereagh SDLP councillor Mairia Cahill said there is “a whf of a radicalised west Belfast teenager about Mary Lou McDonald, who is gleeful about dressing herself up as some type of republican hardliner,” and added: “Isn’t it about time she wised and grew up ”Woman in s distressed after burglary ordeal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard hit back at his party leader’s critics.He tweeted: “If – after all of the events of this week – your ire is directed at an Irish republican standing behind an historical anti-colonial banner in America then you’ve really got to step away from social media for a few days and enjoy the holiday.”• Prominent republican commentator Patricia MacBride has also distanced herself from the Sinn Fein president’s endorsement of the ‘England get out of Ireland’ message.Ahead of the Irish presidential election last year, some commentators suggested there was a likelihood Ms MacBride could be approached by Sinn Fein and offered the chance to run as the party’s candidate. Ms MacBride told the BBC’s Sunday Politics she believes the banner came to prominence during the s. “I think it came to the fore during the daily protests outside the British Consulate in New York City during the hunger strikes in ,” she said.“I think the sign was very much of its time and needs to be consigned to history at this point in time and moving forward.”try catch  TrendingStorm Gareth worse than originally thought -

Neither do they do apologies.”He added: “They’ve never explained, let alone apologised for, the terror their armed wing conducted for so long.”Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann described the banner as “highly offensive and wrong on so many levels”. He said: “It is sad that whilst others celebrate St Patrick in a respectful and non-confrontational manner, Sinn Feinto type.”Mr Swann later tweeted: “Hardly a message in keeping with the message of St Patrick – andthe same mentality had been applied then they would have kicked him out as well ”  behind the banner along with Irish republican supporters in the US\"   behind the banner along with Irish republican supporters in the US\"  Nationalist unity fractured by Sinn Fein’s ‘England out of Ireland’ message Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingStorm Gareth worse than originally thought -

Furthermore, there is no way the unionists Protestants can claim that such a formulation implies they should get out of Ireland — no more than pro-UK Union people would have to leave Scotland when Scotland opts for independence.So why is there such faux shock that Mary Lou McDonald is seen marching with the “England Get Out of Ireland” banner in the New York St Patrick’s Parade  The only real story would beMary Lou had refused to march with that banner. After all, Jimmy Carter in  — seven months before he was elected president — famously marched in the New York St. Patrick’s Day Parade wearing the button “England Get Out of Ireland.” ... And Mary Lou, the president of Sinn Fein, is not supposed to show such sensibility and solidarity. Are you kidding me ! Could anything be more ahistorical... And we are told it’s Irish-Americans who are ahistorical regarding Ireland.Fr Sean McManus, President Irish National Caucus, Washington DCJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/9582865.jpg","title":"news","story":"Parking charges could be on the way to Vale areasAccidentVale mum to star in TV cancer awareness campaignAccident\"\"\"Vale councils# help for homeless rewardedAccident\"\"\"Hotel chain plans next site in PenarthAccident\"\"\"Surgeon shares stories of le working in war zonesAccident\"\"\"Divisions cited as Vale council administration suffers budget disputeAccident\"\"\"Plans for new bypass ‘closest in  years’Accident\"\"\"Vale of Glamorgan Council#s new budget agreedAccident\"\"\"Ty Hafn children#s hospice to support community nursesAccident\"\"\"Main road blocked by tree brought down due to strong windsAccident\"\"\"New Divisional Commander appointed for ValeAccident\"\"\"View from the SeneddAccident\"\"\"Library moves to new site during renovationsAccident\"\"\"Man found dead on beach ruled to have drownedAccident\"\"\"View from Westminster: Stephen Doughty MPAccident\"\"\"Nextbikes scheme could be extended to the ValeAccident\"\"\"Twenty is plenty Vale chiefs tell Welsh GovernmentAccident\"\"\"An Inspector calls: Andy RiceAccident\"\"\"Laughter and partying galore as town enjoys Winter CarnivalAccident\"\"\"New trees to be planted at country parkAccident\"\"\"Explorers ready to take on Iceland expedition for charityAccident\"\"\"Special statement made on Vale council budgetAccident\"\"\"Vale of Glamorgan has lowest rate of diabetes across WalesAccident\"\"\"Cancelled bus routes alarm residentsAccident\"\"\"Fundraiser for care home totals up to £,Accident\"\"\"Volunteers start microplastics survey on beachAccident\"\"\"View from The Senedd: Andrew RT Davies AMAccident\"\"\"View from Westminster: Stephen Doughty MPAccident\"\"\"Delight as company scoops major Welsh awardAccident\"\"\"Penarth, the sea, le and me: Alison PowellAccident\"\"\"Cardf  Vale health board launches eating disorder videosAccident of King Street Penarth.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years.

It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Speaking about the move to its new headquarters in Merchant Square – a £m, , sq ft office – Mr Terrington said:“We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.”On the current political uncertainty, he says: “The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.”Meanwhile, lettings in Belfast are expected to remain buoyant this year despite the uncertain political climate, according to a report from Lambert Smith Hampton. That’s been buoyed by PwC’s pre-letting of the Merchant Square development, which is currently under construction.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.
