It made you angry and you lost your self control. Do you agree or not?\u0027Depp replied: \u0027There were many instances. There was an episode involving her rendezvous with Mr Barker. There were many instances where jealousy did come from my side. \u0027There were many instances where it was provoked if you will.\u0027In a text sent to Heard after the alleged attack read to the court, he said: \u0027Slim I\u0027m truly sorry I could not be more sorry for upsetting you to the degree I have. \u0027I do of course take your generosity and devotion to heart and I reciprocate.

Calling myself savage is certainly not to the effect that you suggest. So I disagree with your dissection of this text.\u0027Depp described himself as \u0027sick\u0027 while infamous footage of him presenting an awards ceremony while under the influence of drugs was played to the court.He denied being drunk in the viral clip of him onstage hosting the Hollywood Film Awards in 2014.Asked about his slurred speech and shambolic appearance, Depp said he had been withdrawing from a \u0027very unpleasant medication.\u0027He said: \u0027I was not drinking.\u0027I don\u0027t feel ashamed of that moment because that\u0027s a sickly man, a drug addict who is coming off a very unpleasant medication and I was not prepared to go out and give that awards show however because they had asked me and it was my duty to do so I carried it through.

Our sense is it needs to be a really good standard but we believe it will definitely be better than what a human could manage. \u0027And in terms of reach - the ability to know people that you have met who you did not know you had met - we believe that the app can make real inroads there.\u0027 8 million people, 14 alerts: why some covid-19 apps are staying silent | MIT Technology ReviewAustralia\u0027s Covidsafe coronavirus tracing app works as few as one in four times for some devices | Australia news | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Facebook considering ban political ads days leading U S election","story":"Share this articleBloomberg - Are you a robot?Facebook Fails to Appease Organizers of Ad Boycott - The New York Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67201d6341f8cfb6f6f2e8f6a5eac358a9dcd301/0_0_5348_3565/master/5348.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=65314df2448fbff3d1f617ba1d9566db","title":"boohoo co founder jalal kamani linked to leicester garment factory","story":"Supplier accused of paying below minimum wage linked to brother of current Boohoo leaderA co-founder of fashion giant Boohoo has links to the Leicester factory accused of paying less than the minimum wage and failing to protect staff from coronavirus, the  can reveal.Boohoo has confirmed that the factory at the heart of the allegations is run by Morefray Ltd, a Manchester-owned firm with ties to the separate I Saw It First fashion brand. The I Saw It First business was set up by Jalal Kamani, 60, who jointly founded Boohoo with his brother Mahmud, 55.The public filings raise further questions of Boohoo after a report in the Sunday Times that claimed staff at one of the fashion company’s suppliers were paid less than minimum wage and did not have masks to protect against coronavirus. An undercover reporter working at the Morefray factory was told to expect pay of £3.50 an hour, compared with the national minimum wage of £8.72 for over-25s.Boohoo launched an urgent investigation into its supply chain this week, saying conditions at the Leicester warehouse were “totally unacceptable and fall woefully short of any standards acceptable in any workplace”.The company added that it was trying to identify the company at the centre of the allegations.

One of Zogan’s directors describes themselves on professional social media network LinkedIn as “head of tax” at Kamani Group. Jalal Kamani is a co-director of several other companies with Irshad and other directors of Zogan.A spokesman for I Saw It First said: “I5 Holdings Limited owns a non-controlling shareholding in Morefray Limited.” The spokesman declined to answer further questions about the company. Someone who answered a telephone number for Morefray declined to comment.A Boohoo spokesman confirmed that Morefray was the Boohoo supplier at the centre of the allegations but said that Mahmud Kamani had no involvement in the business.“Morefray is a recognised supplier to Boohoo and we have never previously been aware of any allegations of paying below the minimum wage until the media report,” said Boohoo. “As a result of that report and subsequent discovery that it was Morefray and not the company in the media report, we are immediately visiting the Morefray site to investigate further.”On Wednesday, Boohoo announced an independent review of its UK supply chain. The review, led by Alison Levitt QC, will be accompanied by a £10m investment in “eradicating malpractice” in its supply chain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/321d453782795e76269f782a40ae30c06a770613/58_444_3392_2036/master/3392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43fc92c63915135e42fa69318e5c358d","title":"black history is everyones history slavery windrush","story":"From slavery to Windrush, the stories of yesterday still impact on our lives.

It’s about our own country.Britain’s Black History Month has been running for more than 30 years. Yet it took the toppling of the statue of a 17th-century Bristol slave trader for most people to discover that the legacy of slavery runs deep throughout the entire country – in its banks and its major cities. Indeed, the “compensation” paid to slave owners after abolition was so vast that it took until 2015 for Britain to finish paying the bill.In 2008, when the  first printed the wallchart series which we’re updating in the newspaper from this Saturday, the 60th anniversary of the Empire Windrush was being celebrated. This story is about the present, too, because the name of that ship has now become synonymous with the scandalous way an entire generation of post-second-world-war migrants has been treated.In 2008, the world witnessed the momentous election of the first ever African American US president. Today, we are in a similar moment of great change, as the death of George Floyd under the knee of a US police officer provokes a deep soul-searching about fundamental issues regarding equality and life chances for racial minorities in general, and black people in particular.

Yet he’s just been made chair of the intelligence committeeNews that Chris Grayling is to be appointed chair of the intelligence and security committee feels like a cosmic inevitability. There is simply no aspect of the British state that is regarded as too big to Grayl. In the event of nuclear devastation, almost certainly somehow caused by Chris Grayling, Chris Grayling would not simply survive, but there would be someone surveying the ash cloud and the onset of nuclear winter going: “You know what, clearing this up looks like a job for Chris Grayling.”Please don’t ask by what arcane Downing Street process committee appointments such as Grayling’s are decided. You are much better off imagining a wingbacked armchair with its back to the viewer, so that all that can be heard is a Mr Burns voice rasping: “Grayling, you say. Remind me of his track record.” “Well, put simply, sir … his record is that there is no longer a track. There’s just a huge stretch of scorched earth, dozens of charred horse skeletons, and it’s all overhung by a noxious pall so toxic it makes the Chernobyl exclusion zone seem like a visit to the Selfridges perfume counter.” “Perfect. Prepare his office.”What do you even call this way of parcelling out power to inept satellites? A wallygarchy? At least Putin’s guys are competent. If one of them is ordered to take a company off the state’s hands or boil someone in oil, they discharge the task competently and with the requisite amount of pride in their work. Chris Grayling would bankrupt the company and boil the wrong guy, and in any case blow up the entire oil refinery in the process. He himself would walk from the conflagration unscathed – a sort of Terminator of shitness, who promptly receives a call on his mobile. “Chris, old boy!” the chap on the other end of the line would say. “Glad I caught you. How d’you fancy running something called a track and trace programme?”Speaking of Vladimir Putin, the big focus for the intelligence committee is to finally publish the report into alleged Russian interference in UK politics. This document has been missing in one of those bureaucratic Bermuda triangles so beloved of transparent states. First it couldn’t be published because the committee couldn’t meet because we were having an election and after the election they couldn’t publish it because they hadn’t convened the new committee. The report was sent to Downing Street last 17 October. Back then, it was said the likelihood of its contents being a bombshell was fairly slim, as the security services had signed off promptly on its conclusions.Alas, even accounting for the advent of the coronavirus, the sheer amount of time that has passed since that moment has fanned the flame of hope, tended in some quarters, that the Russia report contains a smoking gun – some sensational revelation, some neat explanation for whichever development in British political life over the past four years the hoper can’t stomach any other way. We shall see.For now, Grayling’s ascent to chairman is expected to be a formality. I very much enjoyed last night’s  headline, “Grayling closes in on role as chair of UK intelligence committee”. Closing in suggests a degree of targeted precision that Chris Grayling’s career does not. The only way Chris Grayling could close in on the intelligence and security chair is if he was actually attempting to close in on the keys to a holiday caravan in Rhyl.Before he plays us some of his new stuff, then, let’s take a moment to appreciate a few of Chris’s greatest hits. I’m afraid I am wildly constrained by space, though lowlights include his time as justice secretary, during which he instituted a widely condemned ban on books being sent to prisoners, and delivered hugely expensive yet rushed reforms to the probation service that contrived to significantly increase reoffending. The commercial arm of his department attempted to sell prison services to Saudi Arabia.But it would be arguably at transport where his work ascended to the status of art form. He presided over the collapse of Govia Thameslink and Northern rail services, of course, though his My Way is surely the story of Seaborne Freight. This is the one where Grayling paid £1m to consultants and awarded a £14m contract to a firm for ferry services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It swiftly emerged that the terms and conditions on Seaborne Freight’s website were cut and pasted from a food delivery firm. In one section they pointed out: “It is the responsibility of the customer to thoroughly check the supplied goods before agreeing to pay for any mealorder.” Grayling, alas, had failed to check Seaborne’s goods before paying, and so it was that he only found out after losing £14m that the ferry firm … that the ferry firm… I’m so sorry, I can never believe I have to type this … that the ferry firm had no ferries.When news of Grayling’s appointment broke, some people marvelled: “How does he do it?”. As though the tendency were something new. In fact, seeing men like Grayling continue to fail upwards is deeply traditional. Far from being an aberration, it is in keeping with the spirit of the political age: an aggressively misplaced nostalgia.Indeed, there is an aspect of Brexit and the calibre of its ascendant personnel that has always felt karmic. Grayling’s wildly overpromoted slapdashery is precisely the level of failure and incompetence you might have found in, say, the British Raj. Had he been born under earlier stars, you can absolutely see Chris dashing off a few catastrophic boundary changes for Louis Mountbatten, or ruining a province only to be rewarded with a bigger one. The difference is that we’ve brought it all home now. Having run out of other countries to do it to, Britain is now British empiring itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bdfc1ca68c96eb0ce0f7e6b59ce5c7a5d71c62a/0_0_6048_4024/master/6048.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=23114b5bf39dde0c6dde2abc51a2f407 1440w","title":"what tattoo are you planning on getting post lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from people who are looking at getting a new tattoo and the reasons behind itWith tattoo parlours in England able to reopen from 13 July we would like to know what tattoos people will be getting post-lockdown.What design are you getting and why?

The Arsenal manager’s wifi had apparently been playing up all day and it seemed some kind of local power outage was more of an issue, at that moment, than well-worn questions about the local balance of power. “Technical issues” was the reason given.Arteta knows all about those, in a different sense. When he took over before Christmas it was hard to know where he should start: technically, tactically and temperamentally, Arsenal were a mess and Arteta was keenly aware. Their mentality was wrong and the biggest job, he felt, was to engage the players’ brains in a way that swept them along with him. “I want to do things my way,” he said at his unveiling. “But by convincing them it’s the right way for everybody to live better.”For half an hour against Leicester on Tuesday, Arteta’s starting XI certainly appeared to be living their best lives. They should have added to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s goal but this was their most consistently threatening period in a league game all season, the ball recycled crisply, urgently and intelligently. It was the kind of football that takes you places: ambitious but diligent direct but intricately mapped. Arsenal cannot yet sustain that over 90 minutes but it felt like a tantalising snapshot of days to come.Was this the closest we have seen to a Mikel Arteta side? “I want to be the Arsenal team, not the Mikel Arteta team,” he said on Friday, through a fully functioning video link, but he did not disabuse anyone of the overriding notion. “I want the players to play that way as much as possible during the games, to be in the opposition’s half, to be very aggressive every time.”The uptick in aggression is clear. Before Arteta’s arrival, Arsenal turned their backs on opposition goalkeepers’ clearances. Now they see them as scoring opportunities. The two goals that have delighted him most in recent weeks are the tap-ins converted by Eddie Nketiah against Southampton and Aubameyang, six days later against Norwich, after chasing down dawdling keepers. They were grievous blunders from an opposition perspective but for Arteta their proximity was vindication. “It’s good these things actually happen in games because it helps convince the players,” he said last week.There it was again: the emphasis on cajoling players in his direction. Arteta’s ability to convey messages relatably is among his strongest suits and has helped to ensure Aubameyang has a complicated decision to make about his next contract. But people respond best when directly involved in the consequences attached to those words. It is a simple idea but there is no purer sign of a coaching schema paying off than when tactical expositions become, via practice, proven means of winning games.The learning environment under Arteta is described by one figure close to it as “testing but rewarding”. If a young player shows the correct aptitude he will ensure they know and that they are progressed accordingly. His use of Bukayo Saka, already proficient as a left-back or a winger, in four positions since the restart has owed partly to Arsenal’s unbalanced resources but also to his vision of what a singularly intelligent footballer might glean. Nketiah, rarely favoured by Marcelo Bielsa with Leeds, was so hungry and receptive since returning from his loan that Arteta has looked past deficiencies in his all-round game to let him learn on the job at centre-forward.In December the teacherly “non-negotiables” became cast as one of Arteta’s buzzphrases. More recently he has favoured the stipulation that players are “on the boat”. It has arisen in the context of Mattéo Guendouzi, who has been training separately because of perceived attitude problems, and the ever-perplexing case of Mesut Özil.The intensity he demands has not always been channeled perfectly. Nketiah’s red card against Leicester, which may have cost them the game, was their fourth in the league since his appointment. That is a consequence, he thinks, of the outlook they are still perfecting.It was instructive, though, that their most frequent combination was a pass from Xhaka to Kieran Tierney, their left wing-back. That was followed by a ball from Xhaka to Aubameyang, the left-sided forward. Arteta wants his players to be tigerish in the middle and then decisive in utilising speed out wide. It was worth listening to the rest of his answer regarding how closely that first-half purple patch reflected his aims.Arteta knows Arsenal need significant improvement, and preferably a healthy summer of transfer activity, to deliver the full package and has referred to the tentative first year he and Pep Guardiola spent at Manchester City before accelerating that project beyond recognition. But another display of fierce intent in their first visit to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium would heighten the impression that, on the pitch if not via his broadband, he is forging the right connections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aba3f53f14f51059b0c21f78dc0210efc9c1354d/381_95_3354_2014/master/3354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb4ddf8c567db736582056ad990c7917","title":"ryan giggs wales manchester united class of 92 roy keane","story":"The Wales manager on parallels between his squad and Manchester United’s Class of 92, rising expectations and Roy KeaneRyan Giggs is discussing how a wave of talent has revitalised Wales, eroding the reliance on Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, when he draws a comparison to the arrival of a chirpy and tenacious Brazilian teenager at Manchester United. “I played against Gary Neville for so long in training, then all of a sudden Rafael da Silva comes in and he gives you a new lease of life,” he says. “I’m up against someone who wants to smash into me, wants to run off me, wants to make it as difficult as possible for me and I have to up my game. That is the competitive nature I want in training and in the camp.”Giggs believes the emergence of such a vibrant group, coupled with the progress of players such as Daniel James and David Brooks in the Premier League, has helped Bale and Ramsey to thrive for Wales.Beyond Bale and Ramsey, there is now an exciting underbelly of players, many of whom have amassed minutes in key matches, including Joe Morrell, the Bristol City midfielder who played alongside Daniel James and Harry Wilson at youth level. Others, such as the teenagers Neco Williams and Dylan Levitt of Liverpool and Manchester United respectively, are likely to make their senior international debuts when the Nations League returns in September.“There’s a real crop of young players and a lot of them know each other as well, which is great,” Giggs says. “I experienced that with the Class of 92 at United and it does help when you come into the squad. It is fascinating to see because when I took over, when they sat down for dinner or lunch there were maybe two or three ‘more experienced’ tables but now they are all trying to cram on to the young players’ table, and there are about a dozen of them.”But for a global pandemic, last Sunday would have marked the final of Euro 2020 and, when the tournament finally kicks off next June, Giggs is optimistic Wales will arrive in rude health. “If everyone is fit we will be a match for anyone because we have so much talent. We are getting to that stage where we’ve got a couple of players in each position, which Wales have probably never had in regards to strength in depth. When I was playing, if a couple of key players got injured you were really struggling and scraping around to replace them.”Wales will take on Italy, Switzerland and Turkey in Group A and Giggs acknowledges the gaze on his team has shifted, largely owing to the work of his predecessor, Chris Coleman, who guided them to the semi-finals in France four years ago. “What Cookie did made people sit up and take notice. It also has had an effect on fans in Wales and expectations because expectations have gone up. I’ve experienced that you’re expected to win every game and blow teams away at home, certainly against the not-so-big countries. It’s about managing that but the perception has definitely changed. What the country has done over the last four or five years probably deserves that status of being feared and being taken seriously.”It is an intriguing mix of players in 2013, the year Bale made a then world record £86m transfer, Kieffer Moore, the striker now of Championship side Wigan, was juggling playing part-time for Dorchester Town with weekday duties as a lifeguard and personal trainer.Whittling the squad down to 23 names next summer, Giggs says, is going to be an “absolute nightmare”, but citing Ben Woodburn and Ethan Ampadu, he raises the importance of players getting regular game time. Woodburn, on loan at Oxford, has struggled for form and fitness since eclipsing Michael Owen’s record as Liverpool’s youngest goalscorer four years ago, while Ampadu, who has started four of Wales’ past five matches, failed to start a league match for Leipzig on loan from Chelsea.Giggs is excited by the promise of the Pogba-Fernandes midfield axis. “What Fernandes has shown is the consistency. Every game he looks like he’s going to do something he’s going to shoot from 30 yards, create something and he is going to test the opposition. Pogba is capable of doing that but has perhaps done it for two games and then been quiet for a game and not quite had that consistency. Of course he has got the skill but he now needs to add that. He hasn’t got that excuse any more that perhaps he was looking around and thinking he hasn’t got the players around him. Now he has got a player of equal status and quality to take the burden off his shoulders.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7df6c6a0f4b8cdb488a500a55d05b6897e51aac5/0_62_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24fff6487a4d99f3ed39f84d96a977cc","title":"shared screen time can help five unexpected ways to really connect with your kids","story":"From toddlers to teens, here’s how to keep the lockdown closeness thrivingAnnabel Rosenhead, a psychotherapist who’s co-authored Happy Confident Me with parenting coach Nadim Saad, reveals five simple but effective ways to keep connecting:1. Talk franklyFrom teachers wearing masks at school to cancelled holidays, coming out of lockdown can mean tricky conversations and how you approach these topics can make all the difference. Rosenhead explains: “Our children – whatever age they are – are our mirrors. So, before you talk to them, check in with yourself. ‘Am I stressed? Overwhelmed? Anxious?’ and address what you need, even if it’s just five minutes in a room by yourself. Because it’s not what you’re saying but how you’re saying it that’s important.“Then, think about what you’re going to tell your children (don’t just blunder in) and get on the same level as them – difficult conversations are often best had when you’re doing something together, such as going for a walk or playing snap. With a four-year-old, it could be colouring in, while for teenagers it may be gaming together or cooking.”3. Let them take over“The way children have been really affected by the pandemic – from younger ones right the way through to young adults – is a lack of agency. As a child, you don’t have much control anyway but now that’s shrunk right down,” says Rosenhead. “Any sense of independence at school is no longer happening, which can also affect their self-esteem and mental wellbeing. So you need to counter this with connection, communication and giving them their agency back.“For example, I’ve been going on daily bike rides with my 10-year-old daughter and I now let her cycle on the road, which I never would have done before lockdown. I let her choose the route, even when she’s got me riding all over the place it’s giving them the opportunities to decide things.” So from navigating with your map app to picking items for online shopping or Googling holiday destinations for the future, let your kids take over some big decisions.5. Do something brand newSearching out recipes for sourdough starters, asking Alexa how to plant tomatoes, downloading Couch to 5K … hobbies have come into their own in lockdown. “Shared experiences are enormously bonding and learning together is a great leveller,” recommends Rosenhead. “Children and teenagers are so used to being told what to do but if you’re both out and about learning something new, you’re doing it as equals. These things give a sense of togetherness and will build memories.” So, yes, studying “How to pogo” videos in the park creates an important parent-child connection. “Hopefully, this time together will be one of the good things our children will take with them into the future,” says Rosenhead.From helping your kids stay connected with their friends to sharing time together as they acquaint you with the intricacies of TikTok, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

Never? Here, the experts reveal what’s right for your child when it comes to a mobile of their ownIt’s 6:22am. A rustle and a whimper come from the room that adjoins our bedroom. My toddler is rousing and I roll over, praying she goes back to sleep as we’d not been able to get to bed until very late the night before. No such joy. She’s awake and now being very loud and shouty about it.I bring her over to the bed and find some family videos on my phone for her to watch while I come to terms with the fact I’ll have to get up having had less than five hours of sleep. Luckily she is easily pleased and videos of her running around patting her “mi ma melly” (big fat belly), and playing peek-a-boo when she’s supposed to be sleeping, keep her occupied for another blissful 10 minutes. She’s not yet two years old and smartphones are already part of her world – for entertainment, as well as being a source of frustration when she wants her parents’ attention.While we are still some years away from having to decide when to get her a phone of her own, lockdown has meant that parents – of young and older children alike – are rethinking how they approach phones and digital devices of all kinds. During this unusual period we’re living through, when is the best time to give your child their very own mobile?For mum of two Emily, lockdown has meant introducing a phone for her nine-year-old daughter earlier than planned. “Whenever we had talked about it with her we’d said she could have a phone when she went to secondary school, when she’s old enough to walk to school on her own and tell us if she’s going for a milkshake with friends after school,” she says. “But lockdown for us has been the undoing of that.”Emily, who lives in Hertfordshire with her husband, their daughter and a seven-year-old son, says that with both parents having to work, the children needed to entertain themselves for much of the day. “It’s been very difficult not to allow them to liaise with friends over apps and chat pages and so forth. My daughter now has an old phone of mine.”According to Sonia Livingstone, co-author of Parenting for a Digital Future, due to be released later this summer, rather than there being a particular age to introduce a child to their first phone, it’s about what’s right for your family. “Research is clear that what matters is an open and frank conversation between parent and child,” she says. “What matters then is both that the child is ready and the parent is ready. The child should be ready both to use a phone independently, to seek help if they encounter a problem, and to be able to turn to the parent for guidance.” In the same vein, she explains, the parent needs to be ready to trust the child and be equipped to deal with possible problems without getting upset.Dr Sharie Coombes, a child and family psychotherapist and author who runs a busy practice in Brighton, says a ballpark age for getting a phone could be pre-puberty or puberty, but agrees it’s more about the right stage than the right age. “It is a privilege to have a smartphone but also it’s a massive responsibility, so it’s got to feel right from the parent’s point of view. Does your child have sufficient need for it? Or will it cause enormous stress for your child to look after?”Coombes suggests drawing up a “contract” that sets out how and when digital devices in the home will be used. Both parent and child can sign it and tack it up somewhere visible. The contract might set out limits for screen time, for both parties, and she emphasises that it’s important not to be abrupt when that limit is approaching.“Some people get quite a strong dopamine hit from screen time, which is why it’s so difficult to give up,” she says. “So if parents are going to let their children have a lot of screen time, they need to avoid saying: ‘OK, turn it off now’ because none of us would like that.” She suggests instead having a countdown – 20 minutes, 15 minutes, five – as a gentle way to warn children their screen time is coming to an end.As far as online safety and parental controls go, Emily has set up her daughter’s phone so that she can’t download any apps, and she’s hidden Safari. However, her daughter has worked out how to command Siri to play slime videos on YouTube Kids, says Emily. “She knows how I feel about that!”For a huge range of resources on online safety and parental controls, Coombes recommends the NSPCC website.At the end of the day, there isn’t a magic age when a child will wake up and be ready for a phone. Instead, when it feels like the time is right, set a good example, create an environment where mutual respect and trust can be built, and don’t forget to set those parental controls.Take the stress out of giving your child their first phone by choosing an unlimited data plan, so that you can always keep connected and they always have access to vital apps such Maps.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

If you’re a parent like me, you’ll be used to the constant chatter about “when” this hallowed day will be.“Just as we teach our children to wash their hands or cross the road, they need to be taught – and reminded – how to use the digital world safely,” says parenting expert Kathy Weston, founder of Tooled Up Education. “Kids need to understand that a phone is a big responsibility and they need to learn how to handle that.”Try these smartphone guidelines to share with your kids and ensure there is never another cross word about phone use again. Wishful thinking? Maybe. But these six rules might lead to a slightly easier life ...1. Working together on the rulesWe sat down together and worked on a contract. There was give and take – I relented on “only use your phone downstairs” and they accepted parental controls. We regularly tweak the contract to reflect their age.“Aim for transparency and openness,” advises Weston. “If our children understand we have their best interests at heart and share a strong, trusting relationship with us from that first phone purchase, it will be a positive experience.” A good starting point is Vodafone’s digital family pledge, which offers great tech house rules.2. Safety firstWhile online safety is essential, the advice can feel overwhelming. “But internet safety doesn’t have to be complicated and time-consuming,” says cybersecurity expert Jonny Pelter, founder of Simple Cyber Life. “First, check your mobile device settings and ensure screen lock and software updates are turned on, plus secure browsing.”Any mobile will have parental controls to help you manage what your child does online and the main mobile providers automatically block 18+ rated content (the filter doesn’t apply on wifi). My girls also understand I may check in on their phone occasionally and they need to ask before downloading apps.“A phone is not a locked diary it is a gateway to the wider world,” says Weston. “Over time, as trust builds, teens can have more privacy as the extent of parental scrutiny changes.”3. No phones in your bedroom at nightThis is the one golden rule I will never, ever back down on. “One of the main things that affects children’s sleep is gadgets in their rooms at night,” says Weston. The Journal of Youth Studies has found one in five adolescents regularly wake at night to check social media or messages and are three times more likely to feel “constantly tired” at school.In our house, we’ve agreed on no phones after 8.30pm and have a family charging station in the kitchen.4. Remember you can always call your parents, no matter what It’s really important your kids know they can phone you whenever they need. Figuring out data use is part of this and it has definitely been a learning curve for us. Amelia was originally on pay-as-you-go and once when she needed to call me she found she had run out of data! Luckily the “emergency” was buying an ice-cream on a park trip.As giving your child a phone is part of keeping them safe, consider an unlimited data plan so they can always get hold of you, plus have access to apps such as Maps. I found data limits were hard for the kids to understand, so unlimited has made life simpler.5. Get social media savvyLove it or hate it, social media is here to stay. In our house we use “How would Granny react?” as a gauge on how to behave online. Tell them to turn off location and be sure you both understand the privacy and safety settings for different platforms, plus how to block and report.“Ensure privacy settings are tight enough and educate your kids on security hygiene such as not oversharing personal data,” says Pelter. “Obviously ensure they only accept friend requests from people they know in real life.”6. You’re really lucky to have a smartphone Finally, it’s important for kids to understand that having a phone is a total luxury. Research from the Office for National Statistics has found that 700,000 young people in the UK live in “digital poverty”, with no access to a device or the internet at home.Tell your kids about Vodafone and Barnardo’s The Great British Tech Appeal, which collects unused smartphones and tablets for disadvantaged families, children and charity workers. Amazingly, there are approximately 40m unused mobile devices in homes across the UK, so now is the time to put that old phone you haven’t touched for years to better use.Take the stress out of giving your child their first phone by choosing an unlimited data plan, so that you can always keep connected and they always have access to vital apps such Maps.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

Try to give that little girl in you what she needs now, rather than hoping your friends willI have a wonderful husband, happy children, good health and a close relationship with my family. But I’ve always struggled with friendship.Every time life has changed (new job, change of home) I have a new optimism that this time I’ll get it right. I long for the joys of getting to know people, of laughing and sharing together, or even just casual conversations. But whatever the reasons, something always seems to go wrong and the pattern repeats: I meet people I hope I could be good friends with – fun, kind, interesting, down to earth people – and we get on for a while, but slowly and surely I feel myself being pushed away. Texts and emails go unanswered. Invitations turned down. The spark fizzles and the friendship dies.I’ve learned to manage my disappointment, but I wish I understood what I do wrong. I do have a really good relationship with my (kind, gentle and intelligent) husband and with my sister, and I have two good female friends I’ve known for many years (although they live some distance away and I don’t think either of them would consider me their best friend). I mention this as I hope it indicates I’m not completely flawed in my approach to other people. But I just can’t get friendship.This has come to a head because recently I’ve started to get to know some of the parents at my children’s school, who I like, and have taken the first tentative steps towards making friends. But I’m so scared the same pattern will repeat itself and I’ll mess this up again.Your longer letter gave me some insight as to what might be the problem. You told me about being bullied at school, then sent away to boarding school, where you were very unhappy, the sabotaging of your exams, the self harm, the eating disorder. I think you’ve developed a coping carapace. Your letter started off bright and breezy – but the more you wrote, the more you let the real you out. I wonder if this is how you are in real life? Maybe you attract people who aren’t really right for you. I wonder if you think the “real you” is not someone people would like?Do you see every new person as a potential friend? This isn’t meant critically, but I think maybe you need to be more discerning, not less. That may seem counterintuitive, but in your letter you came across as someone who is self-aware, kind and has rather a lot going for her. I know it’s easy to define ourselves according to how others see or treat us, but isn’t that giving them too much power?You also mentioned that at times you purposely provoke members of your family, forcing them to prove they still love you. And I think this is absolutely key. I wonder how much you test your friendships and whether you do this too soon?It’s scary to make yourself vulnerable, and if you do this with the wrong people, or too soon in a friendship, and they don’t give you the affirmation you need, it can strengthen your fears. (Some of the examples you gave me of how your “friends” behaved in the past were not friendship, and really rather shoddy behaviour.)Your child now being at school will have put you back into a place of unhappy memories. So go slowly with these new friends. Be interested in them and responsive, but remember that friendship is not about one person doing all the work, and that almost everyone is insecure about meeting new people. Be kind, but also be kind to yourself allow yourself the luxury of asking, “Do I really want to be friends with this person?”Also think back to that little girl crying on the steps, and ask, “What did she need?” Then see if you can provide it for yourself before looking for it in all the potential friends you meet.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

They reflect on rehab and recovery as well as current events including police brutality and the coronavirus pandemic.On the song, Eminem raps: “Bunch of halfwits up in office. Half of us walking around like a zombie apocalypse. Other half are just pissed off and don’t want to wear a mask and they’re just scoffin’. And that’s how you end up catchin’ the shit off ’em.“I just used the same basket as you shoppin’, now I’m in a fuckin’ casket from you coughin’.”Eminem’s lines are a long way from any that the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, would ever use but they articulate similar sentiments. It became compulsory from Friday in Scotland for people to wear face coverings in shops because, Sturgeon said, “we usually don’t know the people we have been in contact with”.Downing Street has faced questions about why more cabinet ministers are not wearing masks. There have been no public sightings of Boris Johnson wearing a face covering, while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was pictured serving food to customers at Wagamama with nothing on his face but a grin.The president of the Royal Society, Venki Ramakrishnan, said on Monday that refusing to wear a mask in indoor public settings should become as socially unacceptable as drink-driving or not wearing a seatbelt.The collaboration between Eminem and Kid Cudi was announced on Twitter on Wednesday by Kid Cudi’s daughter, Vada.The track also refers to the deaths of George Floyd, who was killed by a white police officer who knelt on his neck for nine minutes, and Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot and killed in February while out jogging.“Prayers to George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery.

The fashion designers Stella McCartney, Alice Temperley and Phoebe Philo live in the town or nearby, as does the war photographer Don McCullin, and the filmmaker Sam Taylor-Johnson with her actor husband, Aaron.The actor Rhys Ifans lives in the centre of the town near Caroline Corr, of the Corrs, and Dominic Greensmith of the rock band Reef.The influx has led the town, which boasts two private secondary schools and a state boarding secondary school, to be labelled the “next Chipping Norton” and British Vogue called it “the new Notting Hill”.Iwan Wirth and Manuela Hauser, the founders of global art gallery network Hauser \u0026amp Wirth who are regularly described as “the most powerful couple in the art world”, moved to Bruton in 2007, selling their former home in Holland Park, west London, to the Beckhams for £30m.The couple now own a farm, vineyard and hotel in Bruton, and in 2014 they opened a branch of the Hauser \u0026amp Wirth gallery in converted barns overlooking the town. The gallery’s restaurant was so busy for lunch this week that those turned away from its patio tables were asked to wait 45 minutes for £18 steak salads and £15 miso roast carrots to eat takeaway in the car park. Many obliged.Mendoza-Wilson, the director of investor relations for System Capital Management, a huge conglomerate owned by Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, says famous and creative people have attracted each other to the town and created a “real buzz and energy about the place” that has pulled in the wealthy and driven up his house price “massively”.Mendoza-Wilson’s boss has not bought into Bruton yet, but he could afford to buy the whole town. Akhmetov, whose fortune is estimated at £5.2bn, recently bought a €200m (£180m) villa in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat on the Côte d’Azur to add to his portfolio, which includes a £137m flat in London’s One Hyde Park and the Ukrainian football club FC Shakhtar Donetsk.Another billionaire, however, has bought into Bruton. In 2013 the South African internet mogul Koos Bekker and his wife, Karen Roos, a former editor of Elle Decoration South Africa, bought the Grade II*-listed Hadspen House, the seat of the Hobhouse family since the late 18th century.The £12m house, which was said to have also been eyed by Johnny Depp, has been transformed into a £475-a-night country hotel and spa. Those with a smaller budget can pay £20 for a ticket to tour the gardens, which are being returned to their Edwardian glory by a team of 18 full-time gardeners. (If you like apples, it might be worth it as there are 267 varieties of apple tree.) There are also three restaurants, taking the number catering for a town with a population of less than 3,000 to six.The latest restaurant to open on the High Street is Osip, run by Merlin Labron-Johnson, who at 24 became the youngest chef to win a Michelin star at his former London restaurant Portland in 2015.Labron-Johnson, who has just arrived back in Bruton from his girlfriend’s house in London as he prepares to reopen Osip, says he was on the lookout for a new project outside London but had not considered Bruton until his financial adviser suggested it.He moved last year and Osip, which he describes as “a tiny farm-to-table restaurant” with no menu, opened in November. Food is grown on the restaurant’s allotment, bought from local farmers or foraged from neighbours’ gardens in return for free meals. (The strawberries are from Mendoza-Wilson’s vegetable patch). Dinner costs £65 per person.“I came to visit, and I fell in love,” Labron-Johnson says. “This is home now. I was slightly nervous that the locals would say: ‘Oh God, not another person from London doing a fancy restaurant’, but people have been really welcoming.”While those who have also relocated from London have been welcoming, families who have lived in Bruton for generations complain that the “influx of those people from London” has pushed out cheaper restaurants and shops to make space to cater for the wealthy.The rise in house prices, estimated by the high-street estate agent Hunter French to have increased by a third in five years, has also angered local people who cannot afford housing.“Bruton is not for locals any more,” says Deborah Eaton, who is taking her grandson Jack and dog Chaos for a walk along the River Brue. “It’s all fancy restaurants we can’t afford and every other house is on Airbnb for silly money.“It has completely changed – you used to walk from one end of the town to the other and it was nothing but shops. Now the Londoners are buying up all the shops and turning them into houses. My son can’t get anywhere to live. He’s in a tiny rental. The prices have got ridiculous.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9268c8d75b95240fd7c03da9548e9d6d3f24c361/0_97_4327_2598/master/4327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c0e833d3fce6855b99cf0ab1ef66245","title":"the leicester garment factories exposed by covid 19","story":"A spike in cases of Covid-19 in Leicester has led  reporter Archie Bland to its garment factories.

The current plan is to establish a data engineering team, data science team, a skunkworks and an analytical deep e unit,” it said.The term “skunkworks” was coined by workers at the aircraft maker Lockheed Martin to cover a small, loosely organised group working on innovative projects and unencumbered by bureaucracy.One of the priority policy areas highlighted in the advert for which “analysis is critical”, is “how to optimally achieve net-zero”. It said outside applicants can expect to earn £135,000 – or perhaps more for an “outstanding candidate” – a salary level likely to raise eyebrows in Whitehall.“The unit will ensure that No 10 is an intelligent customer of analysis, providing challenge and feedback across government,” the advert said. It warned that this may require “storytelling”, and the ability to “look through a different lens”.Creating the new unit is part of a radical shake-up of government, foreshadowed in a blogpost by Cummings in January, in which he highlighted the importance of data analysis. He also claimed “some people in government are prepared to take risks to change things a lot”.Michael Gove used a recent lecture to bemoan the lack of “hard, testable data” to evaluate whether policies conceived in Whitehall have worked well on the ground. “Government needs to be rigorous and fearless in its evaluation of policy and projects,” he said. Gove also suggested more data should be made public.“If government ensures its departments and agencies share and publish data far more, then data analytics specialists can help us more rigorously to evaluate policy successes and delivery failures,” he argued.News of the creation of “10ds” follows the announcement that Whitehall communications are being centralised, with scores of press officers laid off from inidual departments, and their reporting lines shifted from their home department to Downing Street.A string of senior Whitehall figures have left their posts in recent weeks, including cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, whose resignation was followed by the announcement that he would receive a compensation payment of almost £250,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3504c1488f4f734f81dc51ab3ecdcb3d6149e34b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=928978d1f5a730e3e1623342f67019c7","title":"firm with links to gove and cummings given covid 19 contract without open tender","story":"Research company owned by associates of senior Tory and PM’s adviser gets £840,000 jobThe Cabinet Office has awarded an £840,000 contract to research public opinion about government policies to a company owned by two long-term associates of Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings, without putting the work out for tender.Public First, a small policy and research company in London, is run by James Frayne, whose work alongside Cummings – the prime minister’s senior adviser – dates back to a Eurosceptic campaign 20 years ago, and Rachel Wolf, a former adviser to Gove who co-wrote the Conservative party’s 2019 election manifesto.The government justified the absence of a competitive tendering process, which would have enabled other companies to bid, under emergency regulations that allow services to be urgently commissioned in response to the Covid-19 crisis.However, the Cabinet Office’s public record states that portions of the work, which involved focus group research, related to Brexit rather than Covid-19, a joint investigation by the  and openDemocracy has established.A Cabinet Office spokesman said this was because of bookkeeping methods, and insisted that, contrary to government records, all the focus group research done by Public First was related to the pandemic.The Cabinet Office, where Gove is the minister responsible, initially commissioned Public First to carry out focus groups from 3 March, although no contract was put in place until 5 June.Government work is legally required to be put out for competitive tender to ensure the best qualified company is appointed, unless there are exceptional circumstances, such as an unforeseen emergency.When a contract was finally produced on 5 June, it was made retrospective to cover the work done since 3 March. The Cabinet Office paid Public First £253,000 for the two projects listed as being Brexit-related and two more pieces of work done before the contract was put in place.Public First was required to conduct focus groups “covering the general public and key sub-groups”, according to a Cabinet Office letter.The firm was required to provide the government with “topline reporting” of their findings on the same day, with fuller findings reported the following day. The deal also included “on-site resource to support No 10 communications” in the form of a Public First partner, Gabriel Milland, being seconded to Downing Street until 26 June.Milland was the head of communications at the Department for Education when Gove was the minister and Cummings was his political adviser.The Cabinet Office said in the letter that it had commissioned the work from Public First for a total of £840,000 without any tender “due to unforeseeable consequences of the current Covid-19 pandemic”. According to further details published by the government under its transparency requirements, Public First was paid £58,000 on 18 March for its first focus group work, classed by the Cabinet Office as being for “Gov Comms EU Exit Prog”, then a further £75,000 on 20 March for work classed as “Insight and Evaluation”.On 2 April, 10 days into lockdown and with increasing numbers of people dying from Covid-19, the Cabinet Office paid Public First £42,000 for work listed again as “EU Exit Comms”. The first payment for work listed as being coronavirus-related was on 27 May: £78,187.07. A total of £253,187.07 was paid to Public First before the contract was entered into on 5 June.The Cabinet Office spokesman told the  that all the focus group work was related to the government’s Covid-19 messaging, and that the references to Brexit in the government’s official disclosures were misleading.He said the Cabinet Office accounts department did not immediately open a “cost code” classification for expenditure relating to the crisis, so the payments were initially allocated to an existing cost code, which included communications about Brexit.The political partnerships of Frayne and Cummings date back to at least 2000, when they worked together on Business for Sterling, the campaign against Britain joining the euro. In 2003, they co-founded a rightwing thinktank, the New Frontiers Foundation, and the following year set up the campaign to fight the proposed formation of a regional assembly in north-east England.Cummings has described that successful campaign, which was based on portraying politicians as a drain on ordinary people, as “a training exercise for an EU referendum”.Gove became the education secretary after the 2010 election, with Cummings as his chief political adviser, and Frayne was appointed as the department’s director of communications the following year.In 2010, Wolf, a former special adviser to Gove, was running the New Schools Network to promote free schools, which was awarded a £500,000 contract by the department that year without a tender. It was justified on the basis that it was the only organisation able to provide expert support quickly enough.The Cabinet Office contract with Public First is being challenged by the Good Law Project, which wrote to Gove on Thursday arguing that the absence of a tendering process was unlawful and not justified by the Covid-19 emergency provisions.In a letter telling Gove that they plan to seek a judicial review of the contract award, the project’s lawyers, Rook Irwin Sweeney, argue there is “apparent bias” in the contract going to Public First, due to their “close personal and professional connections” with Gove and Cummings.Asked if Public First’s links to Gove and Cummings were a factor in the firm being awarded the contract, the Cabinet Office spokesman replied: “This is nonsense. Public First were contracted to undertake this work because of their wealth of experience in the area.“Public First was awarded a contract to carry out daily focus groups across the country in response to the Covid-19 crisis,” the spokesman said. “They carried out this work to make sure the vitally important public health messages the government was issuing were the right ones. This work will continue to inform future Covid-19 campaign activity.”Rachel Reeves, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “It beggars belief that the government’s desperate defence of handing a contract for daily focus groups on Covid-19 to longstanding friends of ministers is coincidence, and to blame clerical incompetence for the reference to the work on Brexit. They should come clean about the purpose of this project, why this company was chosen without it going to tender and publish the research findings and recommendations for people to see for themselves.”Public First declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a4ba53d324b7e357a1b25618e433c51733e8251/0_0_2979_1787/master/2979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=844c165b6acdd4dd6fe5152f59c765c4","title":"government launches new get ready for brexit campaign","story":"Businesses will discover details of customs regime after Brexit on MondayThe government is set to launch a multi-million pound “Get Ready for Brexit” campaign on Monday, as businesses awaited details of the complex customs regime they will face.More information about the campaign, which will be partly aimed at Britons living in the EU, will be confirmed by Michael Gove in TV interviews scheduled for Sunday. The controversial Brexit border plans – which were criticised this week by the international trade secretary, Liz Truss – will be published on Monday along with fresh detail on post-Brexit immigration.A 90-page draft of the new border arrangements, “The Border with the European Union, Importing and Exporting Goods”, seen by the , lays bare the complicated new paperwork facing all businesses from 1 January, whether there is a deal or not.Sources say a later draft runs to more than 100 pages and will give businesses the first confirmed details of the scale of the challenge they face in less than six months’ time.The draft version features flow charts and “process maps” instructing businesses on the steps they will need to take in future and needs a three-page glossary to explain some terms relating to importing and exporting.It notes that from January, all businesses trading with the EU need to prepare for customs declarations, which have not been required since 1993, when the single market brought down trade barriers.A series of new inland customs clearance centres and border control posts are expected be built to alleviate congestion in ports including Dover, Portsmouth and Holyhead. New VAT and excise duty arrangements will also apply, with checks to confirm the ID of the driver and that the cargo matches the paperwork provided.Hauliers will be warned that if they bring in goods for personal use such as alcohol and cigarettes, they will have to be checked even if their cargo is cleared by customs. “When traders return to the UK, if they bring goods back in their baggage, they should go through the red channel at customs,” it says.Under a phased-in approach lasting six months, the government will hope to get tens of thousands of businesses familiar with the new system, but some fear the IT needed for the so-called “Goods Movement Vehicle Services” will not be ready in time.It will be trialled in Northern Ireland in November, according to an 11-page HM Revenue and Customs document seen by the .Last year, the government launched its first “Get ready for Brexit” campaign ahead of Britain’s planned departure on 31 October, urging businesses and iniduals to prepare. It was halted three days before the UK was supposed to leave, as the EU granted another extension.It is believed that there will need to be a further campaign by the government if no trade deal is agreed with the EU. From 1 January an extra system would be in place involving tariffs on food, clothing and components in addition to the customs, VAT, security and health checks on animal and plant products.Checks will be phased in over six months, starting in January, a decision that led to conflict in the party, with Truss writing to Gove and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to warn that this could leave the UK “vulnerable” to smuggling and to a legal challenge by the World Trade Organization.While most of the communications will be aimed at businesses, the Foreign Office will also be launching a new advertising campaign on Monday to reach as many as possible of the estimated 1m Britons living in Europe to remind them of Brexit-related changes that will affect them.A government spokesperson said: “We are planning a comprehensive communication campaign from mid-July, to make sure people and businesses know what they need to prepare for the end of the transition period.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/087cf379868627663b1e1ccdd028af11961e55c6/0_0_4000_2250/master/4000.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4fbeed4cf46e386c1896906507a50513 1760w","title":"tiktok amazon security china","story":"Email to some workers calling for removal of app due to ‘security risks’ was sent in error, spokesperson saysAmazon made waves on Friday when it emailed some employees instructing them to delete TikTok from their phones over security concerns tied to the China-owned app.But hours later an Amazon spokesperson said the request had been sent out in error and that there was no change to the company’s policies at the moment.An internal memo sent to Amazon employees on Friday morning had given them until the end of the day to delete the app “due to security risks” or risk losing mobile access to company email accounts. TikTok has exploded in popularity in recent months. The video app, in which users share short videos set to music or dialogue, has been downloaded roughly 2bn times and became the most downloaded app in the world in the first quarter of 2020. But TikTok is facing growing scrutiny from US authorities.The app has drawn criticism from US politicians since its launch in 2018. TikTok started as Musical.ly, a lip-sync app, and was acquired by the Chinese company ByteDance in 2017. The acquisition led to a national security investigation by the US government in 2019.The US army and navy instructed soldiers to delete the app from military devices in December.In March, two Republican senators introduced legislation that would prohibit federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued work phones.And in May, more than a dozen members of Congress called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the app for alleged Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act violations.On Monday, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the Trump administration was considering banning TikTok due to national security threats. “This clearly has issues with regards to privacy for users,” he said.Schmidt said other concerns were that the Chinese government would use the downloaded software to surveil activity and content on TikTok user phones, particularly of those in the US military or government, or censor content on TikTok “that doesn’t conform with the Chinese government’s positions on human rights”.In 2019, leaked internal documents showed TikTok instructed moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong. Previously it was reported that TikTok was scrubbed of any videos of Hong Kong protests.TikTok has been increasing its presence in the US, bringing on the California-based former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as chief executive officer in May and hiring more lobbyists in Washington DC.TikTok did not immediately respond to request for comment but said in a statement that security was “of the utmost importance” to the company.“While Amazon did not communicate to us before sending their email, and we still do not understand their concerns, we welcome a dialogue,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a31590603fa951e2d6c94b6307f52059f162dbc/0_720_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3edc7fd460e25c060d9f809f00cfb34","title":"englands lidos can open on saturday but swimmers cant dive in just yet","story":"Many outdoor pools won’t be ready this weekend and some may not open at all this summer, despite the change in government advice Culture secretary Oliver Dowden’s announcement on 9 July that lidos can reopen from Saturday 11 July had outdoor swimmers across the UK digging out their towels and togs at the prospect of being able to return to the water. After months of what has felt like bone-dry purgatory for many of us, the feverish anticipation was evident across social media, while pools have reported being inundated with messages asking if they would be opening on Saturday.But swimmers will need to be patient a little while longer. Being given just 48 hours’ notice that your business can reopen is a challenge for any sector. Scrambling to fit the physical infrastructure such as perspex screens and signage, mark out one-way systems and source PPE is a mammoth struggle. Swimming pools have to do all that, but also have unique challenges which render opening within 48 hours not so much a struggle as a wildly unrealistic proposition.Many of the UK’s 100-plus lidos are seasonal. When lockdown was announced the pools were still in winter slumber mode, which means the water had been untreated for several months and lifeguards had been stood down. To be able to reopen safely, pools must bring their water back to life after a winter of stagnation. There are only two options for this: drain the pool, scrub the tank and refill it or “shock” the water back to clarity by adding strong chemicals. Both processes are expensive and time consuming. And if pools are heated it can take up to another week, once the water is clean, to bring them up to the right temperature.Most of the UK’s remaining publicly accessible outdoor pools are run by volunteers, and operate on a financial knife-edge. They receive no public money and will not have been eligible for very much (if any) pandemic-related financial support from the government to make up for income lost during lockdown. Given the glorious hot weather over the UK for most of June, pools could reasonably have expected a bumper income had they been open.The committees that run pools will not have been able to justify spending thousands of pounds making a pool ready in anticipation of the reopening, only to then have it sitting idle indefinitely accruing more costs for electricity and chemicals to maintain the water quality. And with pools out of action, it is not possible to train and competency test lifeguards.Dozens of seasonal lidos, including all those in Cumbria, Strand Lido in Kent and Moretonhampstead in Devon, have already decided that they cannot viably open at all this summer, because they would not be open long enough to recoup the costs of preparing the pool at short notice. Swim England’s guidance, which will approximately halve the maximum number of swimmers that can be in the water at any one time, as well as reducing overall site capacities, only adds to the financial pressure. Some pools, like Shoalstone Sea Water Pool in Brixham, south Devon, also feel that the requirements of the Swim England guidance would fundamentally alter the swimmers’ experience. They say that measures such as segregation in the water and one-way systems are “contrary to the family experience we encourage”.Of the pools that do intend to open, very few will be ready to do so tomorrow. Three exceptions are: Parliament Hill lido in north London, which is offering pre-bookable one-hour slots from today Charlton lido in south-east London, where booking is essential but where they will double the width of the lanes and halve the number of swimmers and Jubilee Park Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, where online booking is also required and is available from today. Most are now embarking on a period of frenzied work which will see, quite literally, all hands to the pumps. Swimmers will need to be patient while that work takes place, and they’ll need to be patient when pools do eventually reopen as it will not be business as usual. Pre-booking for time-limited slots will become the norm and long, lazy days enjoying pool-side picnics, while dipping in and out of the water are unlikely to be a feature of lido life in 2020.But our patience will be worth it. After so many dry months we are within touching distance of having the sun on our shoulders while we glide through crystal clear water. We’ve waited this long. We can wait a little longer.• Emma Pusill is co-author of The Lido Guide"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a71d61f03cb17b43b16f6b3fcb3d162ed2f3295/0_166_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e7bc3eac8c6ff0962e400b6f5d41d83","title":"texas starr county covid 19 model greg abbott","story":"Officials in Latino Starr county say Greg Abbott’s reopening orders have rendered them toothless, and cases are surgingFive residents from Starr county on Texas’s southern border died on a single day last week after contracting Covid-19. New infections in the rural border community of around 65,000 people have soared in recent weeks, and two intubated patients had to be airlifted to Dallas and San Antonio when overwhelmed local hospitals couldn’t care for them.They developed what officials said was at the time the only drive-through testing site south of San Antonio. They closed schools. They implemented a stay-at-home order, curfew and mandatory face coverings. Only when necessary, they flexed their authority to fine and even jail anyone who flouted the law.Their strategy worked. The first few coronavirus cases trickled into Starr county in late March, but for three weeks in April, there were no new infections. Before the end of May, weekly tallies of new confirmed positives never once reached double digits. Even seasonal influenza, coughs, colds and fevers that would normally travel through the community suddenly vanished.“What we did here was a model for the rest of the nation to follow, but it was lost,” said Joel Villarreal, the mayor of Rio Grande City, one of four small cities in the county. “In fact, I think we had it right.”The inflection point came when the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, unilaterally decided to reopen the state, and stripped local governments of their power in the process. By early May, malls, restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and salons threw open their doors, albeit at limited capacity. Texans lost their fear of the virus as politicians told them it was safe to re-emerge from lockdown, and once masks became politicized, localities could no longer require their use.“We had local input to close down. But to reopen, we didn’t have any, at all,” said Villarreal.When local officials contacted the attorney general’s office for clarity about what orders they could continue to enforce, they were informed that the governor’s policies superseded their own. Any attempt to give feedback fell on deaf ears.Both Eloy Vera, the county judge, and Villarreal agreed that the state had to reopen at some point, but they felt Abbott’s approach was too much too fast, and ignored science.“I think if it would have been slower, we could have kept the curve down,” said Vera. Instead, “our numbers are exponentially increasing, and our hospitals are getting to capacity.”They have tried to devise workarounds to protect their communities, including incentivizing businesses to act responsibly. At Border Town Foods, Amando Peña requires all of his employees to wear masks and face shields. He has lost a handful of customers because he continued to enforce mask-wearing at his stores, even when the law and big-box retailers didn’t.“I was like, ‘OK, well, that’s all right,’ because our employees need that protection,” Peña said. “They deserve that respect. So I don’t care that some customers left.”As of last week, Starr county can now mandate face coverings again. But the local government’s other emergency protocols – including a curfew and quotas on gatherings – remain toothless in practice. In Rio Grande City, attorneys are trying to work out what can actually be enforced.“Here we are, fighting a global pandemic, and we’re having to figure out loopholes on how to keep people safe. That is so ridiculous,” Villarreal said.Meanwhile, the virus is spreading like wildfire in a community woefully underequipped to handle an outbreak. About 20 members of a single family contracted Covid-19 after a get-together, as did 30 or 40 attendees at a 500-person wedding, said Jose Vazquez, the county’s health authority. A local nursing home system has faced a barrage of cases, and altogether, 936 Starr county residents tested positive for the disease by 4 July.“Basically, you have no chance to be admitted in a hospital here in the Valley,” said Vazquez. As the situation grows dire, people are starting to realize that “if you were to get sick, nobody can guarantee you any longer that you are going to be doing fine”. Vazquez has also tested positive.Although Texas’s official count is lagging, the county has already suffered 18 fatalities, according to its own data. Its local hospital only recently expanded the Covid-19 unit from eight beds to 18, and in one day, the unit’s occupancy rocketed from eight to 13.“We’re the ones down here. We’re the ones who know our community, we know what our needs are,” said Villarreal. “I say this to the governor: you cannot tie my hands at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6f995dd9d64ab8c8021e66605a0f10801526a61/0_310_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95a96776ee601419edc01b4c4f4189fc","title":"genocide denial gains ground 25 years after srebrenica massacre","story":"Even as remains continue to be identified, denialism is moving from far-right fringe into mainstreamby  Shaun Walker in SrebrenicaAt the genocide memorial centre outside Srebrenica, thousands of simple white gravestones stretch across the gently inclined hillside for as far as the eye can see.Nearby, over a number of days in July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces systematically murdered around 8,000 Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) men and boys. It was the worst crime of the Bosnian war, and remains the only massacre on European soil since the second world war to be ruled a genocide.Even today, remains of victims are still being found and identified. Owing to a cover-up operation to hide the crimes by digging up and dispersing the contents of mass graves, there are cases in which partial remains of the same inidual have been found at as many as five sites several miles apart. At a 25th anniversary commemoration on Saturday, at least eight more victims will finally be laid to rest at the cemetery.A quarter of a century after the events, however, the truth about what happened at Srebrenica is being subjected to a growing chorus of denial, starting in Bosnia itself and echoing around the world, moving from the fringes of the far right into mainstream discourse.In Srebrenica, the denial starts with the mayor. The current population of around 7,000 is one-fifth of the pre-war total, and there are now more Serbs than Bosniaks, a reversal of the situation before the war and genocide. Four years ago, Srebrenica elected its first Serb mayor, Mladen Grujičić, and official rhetoric changed overnight.Grujičić, 38, an energetic former chemistry teacher, has no time for talk of genocide. “No Serb would deny that Bosniaks were killed here in horrible crimes … but a genocide means the deliberate destruction of a people. There was no deliberate attempt to do that here,” he said in an interview at his office in the centre of Srebrenica.He was 10 when the war started. His father was killed during the war in a village not far from Srebrenica. Grujičić pointed out that there were victims on all sides during the conflict, which tore apart multi-ethnic Bosnia after the collapse of Yugoslavia.But what about the international courts that have forensically sifted the evidence and come to the conclusion that the systematic slaughter around Srebrenica in July 1995 did constitute genocide, unlike other crimes during the war? “Unfortunately, all these courts have been biased against the Serbs and this has only deepened isions here,” he shrugged. He has not once during his time in office visited the genocide memorial, which is a five-minute drive from the town hall.His views are in line with those of most Serb politicians in Republika Srpska, the Serb-dominated entity that makes up half of Bosnia’s complicated post-war political system. Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of Bosnia’s tripartite presidency, has called the Srebrenica genocide “a fabricated myth”, and the Republika Srpska authorities have set up a commission to investigate the events. Its report, due later this year, is expected to whitewash the crimes of Bosnian Serb forces.“This is the next phase, even worse than genocide denial: to try to create a new historical reality,” said Serge Brammertz, who spent nearly a decade as chief prosecutor at the UN international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. The tribunal convicted the Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadžić and the military commander Ratko Mladić of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Mladić’s appeal is still under way.The genocide has long been an inspiration for far-right extremists and Islamophobes. The Christchurch mosque attacker last year played a song glorifying Karadžić just prior to the assault, and years earlier Anders Breivik also sought inspiration in the Balkan wars and Serb ultra-nationalism.Recently, however, questioning the genocide has been gaining more mainstream approval. Most infuriating for survivors was the award of last year’s Nobel prize for literature to the Austrian writer Peter Handke. He had delivered a eulogy at the funeral of the Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević and made a number of revisionist statements about the events of the Bosnian war that have led to accusations of genocide denial. In a press conference before the prize-giving ceremony, when Handke was asked whether he accepted that the Srebrenica massacre had happened, he dodged the question, calling it “empty and ignorant” and comparing it to hate mail he said he had received containing soiled toilet paper.Emir Suljagić, who runs the sombre genocide memorial centre at Potočari, just outside Srebrenica, said: “I am not a fan of cancel culture but if there’s one thing that should cancel you, surely it’s genocide denial, it’s speaking at Milošević’s funeral.” The memorial centre is located in the former headquarters of the Dutch UN battalion that in July 1995 failed to protect the people gathered in Srebrenica, which had been declared a UN safe zone. Suljagić, who survived because he worked as a translator for the mission, spoke of the trauma for returnees who have to live in places where the crimes took place. He told a story from his years working as a journalist, covering war crimes trials in The Hague.Suljagić was watching two former Bosnian Serb soldiers give evidence against their commander at one trial. The men testified under pseudonyms and with their voice and appearance altered, but as they recounted their role in a massacre, Suljagić pieced together their identities from information given to the court. He had been to school with both of them. He assumed they had been given immunity for their role in the massacre in exchange for testifying against their commander.“Nine years later, I’m in the parking lot of the local supermarket and one of those guys comes out and recognises me and says: ‘Hi, how are you doing?’ They both live locally. And I’m thinking: ‘Do I tell him? Do I tell him I know?’ In the end, I said nothing, but I still see them occasionally.”With survivors and perpetrators living side by side, and given the country’s ided politics, it is hard to imagine closure and reconciliation coming soon. Hasan Hasanović, who lost his twin brother and his father in the genocide, said it would be possible to talk about progress when school trips of Serb pupils come to tour the genocide memorial, where he works as a guide.Schooling, like so much in Bosnia, is still ided along ethnic lines. Pupils are split into separate classes for “national subjects” such as history, and while the Bosniak textbooks cover the genocide, the Serb textbooks gloss it over. There is little hope of a unified curriculum in the country in the foreseeable future. “The main nationalist parties that continue to benefit from social ision have no interest in changing a isive status quo,” said Valery Perry, of the Democratization Policy Council in Sarajevo.At Srebrenica’s elementary school, teachers avoid discussing the war at all, said the headmaster, Dragi Jovanović. “Even adults, when we sit together, we simply do not touch these topics ... We are trying not to hurt people’s feelings, and at this point you can’t educate the children without hurting their feelings,” he said.How, then, would he respond to a pupil who asked why there was such a vast cemetery on the outskirts of town? “I have never been asked such a question,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9105c60fa82a98dcdcb47b8c3a859a7a36be1d9e/0_361_4800_2878/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e75c1dd25b335b64581189d160a04897","title":"gyms pools and nail bars what the new coronavirus rules in england allow","story":"Beauty parlour rules raise eyebrows, while outdoor theatres allow show to go onA range of premises in England have been allowed to resume operating this week. Here are some of the things people will and won’t be allowed to do:The government has been accused of sexism after setting rules that allow men to have their beards tidied, but prevent eyebrow and upper lip waxing or threading – services largely, but not exclusively, used by women.Beauty parlours are allowed to open from Monday offering services that do not involve work in “the highest risk zone – directly in front of the face”. Specifically outlawed are treatments such as face waxing, eyelash treatments, makeup application and facials, which are all far more popular with women than men.The government has said it is because there is a “much greater risk of transmission”. Yet there is no such guidance for barbers, who were allowed to open on 4 July. They were told they could “reopen for services that relate to cutting or treating hair on the head”.According to the National Hairdressing and Beauty Federation, this prohibits shaves but allows “simple beard trims, thinning or removing bulk or length which can be done using either clippers or scissors”. This should be carried out from the side or by circling the client avoiding the face. Intricate detailing is not allowed.The chairwoman of parliament’s women and equalities committee, Caroline Nokes, said: “We’ve seen barbers trimming eyebrows, we’ve seen them trimming beards and we still have a range of facial practices that can’t be done on women.”She told the Daily  it was important that the UK’s recovery from the coronavirus crisis was “designed to help women every bit as much as men” and that she would be taking the issue up with ministers. Face tattoos are prohibited under the new guidelines, though you could get ink anywhere else on your body from Monday.Physical distancing measures in outdoor pools will not only keep swimmers safe from Covid-19 but also eliminate “lane rage”, one lido operator has said.Lidos can reopen on Saturday but only a few are expected to be ready in time. One is Charlton lido, which will have a limited “friends and family” reopening, with strict pre-booking.GLL Leisure, which runs Charlton lido other and outdoor pools in London and beyond, said it would double the width of the lanes and halve the number of swimmers, making it “better than ever”.Talking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the chief executive, Mark Sesnan, said: “Swimming in the water itself is considered to be very Covid-secure because chlorine kills the virus, but obviously we’ve got to make sure that people are safe outside the water and cut interaction between people.”Swimmers will be asked to book a time in advance and arrive “beach ready” with their costumes already on, he said. Hot showers will be allowed afterwards.The restrictions could lead to more civilised swimming, he suggested: “We are hoping this is the end of lane rage because now there will only ever be a certain number of people in the pool, and people will be graded by their ability.”Indoor gyms, swimming pools and sports facilities can reopen from 25 July, as long as they comply with physical distancing rules. You will no longer be able to rock up whenever the urge takes you, as facilities must limit the number of users via timed booking systems.The good news is that you will no longer end up with your head up someone else’s downward dog. This is because exercise and dance studios have been told to put temporary markings on the floor to keep people 2 metres apart.Say goodbye, too, to sweaty yoga studios, as all premises are required to ensure adequate ventilation. Customers and staff will be encouraged to shower and change at home wherever possible, although changing rooms will be available.From Saturday, performing arts can take place outdoors with a physically distanced audience. This gives the green light to outdoor opera at Glyndebourne in Sussex and plays at Cornwall’s Minack theatre. London’s West End will also return via Six, The Musical – an all-singing account of Henry VIII and his wives – repurposed as a drive-in show.It will remain against the law for gatherings of more than 30 people to take place in private homes (including gardens and other outdoor spaces). But arts companies are allowed to host larger groups outdoors if they follow Covid-19 secure guidelines.When members of the public attend performances, organisers should ensure steps are taken to avoid audiences “needing to unduly raise their voices to each other”, the government said. “This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, including if played at a volume that makes normal conversation difficult, for example, during performance intervals.” This, it said, is “because of the potential for increased risk of transmission particularly from aerosol and droplet transmission”.That means loud music is out, as is anything that encourages “crowding, clustering, communal dancing and physical contact, outside of household groups or support bubbles”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef77cb98551c95669edae210ffaedf1c710e0680/0_20_1473_884/master/1473.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0f46bd0b65c5ce5d724ae4c2a383f1d4","title":"uk magnitsky law does little stem flow dirty money from russia","story":"Sanctions target mid- or low-level officials and will have little impact on the wealthiest He is known as Vladimir Putin’s enforcer. Almost every criminal case in Russia – from Pussy Riot to anti-government street protests – passes his desk. But as of last week Moscow’s top law officer, Alexander Bastrykin, is no longer welcome in Britain. He is banned from owning property, opening a bank account or popping over from Moscow for a weekend jaunt.Bastrykin, the head of Russia’s powerful investigative committee, was one of 25 Russians sanctioned by the UK. All were allegedly involved in human rights abuses – specifically in the mistreatment of Sergei Magnitsky, who was beaten to death in 2009 in a Moscow jail. Bastrykin covered up the case, No 10 says. Others named and shamed include judges, interior ministry officials and prison staff.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, hailed the new Magnitsky law as an illustration of how “global Britain” might be a force for good in the world. He claimed – inaccurately – that Brexit allowed the UK to bring in its own legislation. In fact, EU countries including Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have already passed similar laws, following on from the US Congress in 2012.Raab won cross-party support for his move. He has long backed a Magnitsky act. The government also sanctioned 20 Saudi nationals implicated in the 2018 murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It blacklisted Mynanmar’s two top generals. and targeted the North Korean security bureaus in charge of the country’s gulags.But it remains to be seen how deep the government’s commitment is to dealing with the flow of Moscow-linked money into London, some of which goes into Conservative party coffers. The sanctioned Russians are mostly mid- or low-level officials – “technical people”, as one ex-Kremlin insider put it. None is believed to own property in the UK, or substantial assets.“I don’t think it will bother him,” the Russian journalist Sergei Sokolov said of Bastrykin. In 2012 Sokolov – the deputy editor of the Novaya Gazeta newspaper – accused Bastrykin of failing to pursue a case. A furious Bastrykin allegedly took Solokov to a forest in south-west Moscow and threatened to murder him. Bastrykin denies this and says he does not go in for “nature trips”.A tax auditor, Magnitsky was investigating a $230m fraud perpetrated against Hermitage Capital, a UK investment fund. The same officials he exposed arrested him. The firm’s chief executive, Bill Browder, hailed the UK government’s move as a “milestone” and a “huge win for the good guys”. “The door is open for this to become a feature of British government policy going forward,” he said.According to Browder, the law’s impact goes far beyond the 50-odd iniduals directly affected. Swiss banks were already offloading high-risk Russian clients, he said. He likened personal sanctions to “civil death”. Anyone on the list will show up on the “world check” system used in due diligence checks, meaning they are in effect shut out from international finance.Browder gave evidence to the UK’s intelligence and security committee (ISC) for its Russia report. The ISC is due to reconvene on Monday. It remains to be seen whether its likely new chair, Chris Grayling, will release the report that was suppressed by Boris Johnson. Browder said the government had done little to tackle the problem of dirty money, or to take action against agents who set up anonymous offshore companies.“The main problem is that nobody in the UK seems to have an appetite to prosecute anybody,” Browder said. New unexplained wealth orders are meant to deter foreign kleptocrats. So far, however, only two have been used. One has been issued against a wealthy Azerbaijani woman whose husband has already been jailed in her home country after he fell out with the country’s president.David Clark, a former special adviser to the late Labour former foreign secretary Robin Cook, said he was sceptical the government was willing to act against oligarchs or others able to hire expensive lawyers. “I don’t see British foreign policy post-Brexit putting human rights first,” he said. “It’s going to be trade and power politics.”Clark said Brexit meant Britain would be looking to do deals with non-EU countries on the continent. He predicted a “reset” with Turkey and Russia, despite Moscow’s 2018 nerve agent attack against the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal. Foreign Office sanctions were unlikely to deter future Kremlin plots, he said, noting those hit were “mid-level”. “Putin doesn’t care,” he added.Meanwhile, Johnson’s own Russia ties have yet to be fully explained. As foreign secretary he flew without his security detail to spend the weekend at a palazzo belonging to the Russian media tycoons the Lebedevs. After winning the election Johnson attended Alexander Lebedev’s 60th birthday party. “The prime minister is deeply embedded with the Lebedevs of this world,” Clark said.The early signs are it is business as usual, with realpolitik triumphing over human rights concerns. A day after imposing sanctions on Khashoggi’s assassins, the government announced it was resuming arms sales to Saudi Arabia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb1daf291156b43cda966e6d526e0424832c31d1/0_183_4452_2672/master/4452.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5098122e1e859140cf0d5735bef21257","title":"uk poised to shun eu coronavirus vaccine scheme","story":"Health secretary says government believes there is a quicker way to source a coronavirus vaccine for BritonsThe UK’s decision not to join an EU plan to distribute a potential coronavirus vaccine to its most vulnerable citizens has been described as “unforgivable” and condemned by health charities and opposition politicians.On Friday, Matt Hancock confirmed that the UK would not be participating in the scheme. The health secretary said the UK’s position outside the EU would have left it without a decision-making role as negotiations over purchases were made.The European commission has been in “intensive” talks with leading drugs manufacturers to make advance purchases of any future vaccine.Under the joint procurement plan, the commission will then distribute doses to the Europeans in greatest need first amid an inevitable international battle to source the drugs.Hancock said the government believed there was a quicker way to source a vaccine for Britons.But Alex Harris, the head of global policy at the Wellcome Trust, said the EU scheme had been “morally right” and called for reassurance that the UK was not setting itself up as a competitor to the bloc.“The EU vaccine initiative’s cap on how many doses participating countries get is the best way to ensure there is enough vaccine for those in need in the rest of the world,” he said. “Delivering vaccine according to need and not who can pay the highest price is not just morally right, but also the fastest way to end this pandemic.“We urge the UK government to follow the EU’s lead and only secure vaccine doses for those who need it most (healthcare workers, over-65s and other vulnerable groups).”The UK government’s decision to pull out of talks with the European commission comes despite evidence of an international battle among rich countries to buy up coronavirus drugs.The White House has purchased much of the world supply of remdesivir, which has been used to treat coronavirus symptoms.A spokesman for the European commission said its negotiations with manufacturers would continue and that it was believed the EU remained a big enough market for the right prices to be negotiated.He said: “The negotiations are ongoing with a series of vaccine producers. These are intensive negotiations which the commission is carrying out on behalf of the different member states.“The fact that the UK has apparently said it would not join up to whatever scheme, whatever contracts, we are able to negotiate is definitely not something which is going to inform our negotiations. We believe that the EU, with its significant population, represents an interesting market for the companies with which we are negotiating.”Sir Tim Barrow, the UK’s ambassador to the EU, brought weeks of talks over potential involvement in the scheme to a close in a letter to the European commission’s secretary-general, Ilze Juhansone, announcing that the government had “decided on this occasion not to join this internal EU initiative”.The EU is in negotiations with the US firm Johnson \u0026amp Johnson over its plans to use a €2.7bn (£2.4bn) emergency fund to seal advance purchase agreements.The UK was eligible to be involved under a withdrawal agreement that came into force when the country left the EU on 31 January. During the transition period, ending on 31 December, the country remains in the EU’s single market and customs union.Under Brussels’ proposed procurement scheme, the commission will finance part of the upfront costs of vaccine production in exchange for the right to buy a specified number of doses at an agreed price and timeframe.The UK has not taken part in any of the previous EU joint procurements of personal protective equipment or ventilators despite shortages during the pandemic.In response to the UK government’s decision to walk away from the latest initiative, Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokeswoman, said: “When coronavirus is such a threat to people’s lives and livelihoods, ministers should leave no stone unturned in their bid to end the pandemic.“This government’s stubborn unwillingness to work with the European Union through the current crisis is unforgivable. “The crisis does not stop at any national border. It is about time the prime minister started showing leadership, including fully participating in all EU efforts to secure critical medical supplies and a vaccine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6783005927aa639a1c612794d150b1ca7e07c493/804_230_2696_1618/master/2696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18f7938ceac805d1f26b8e9931324931","title":"the non running of pamplona bulls in pictures","story":"The coronavirus pandemic has brought Spanish bullfighting, long reviled by animal rights campaigners, to a standstill.

Even with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations in place, they were determined to pay tribute to a man they considered a hero.However, there are others who experienced the brutal side of the 64-year-old, who hold sharply different views about the man lauded in Anderstown and the Falls Road.Storey, who died on June 21st after an unsuccessful lung transplant in a National Health Service hospital in England, may be the “most famous Provo” that most people, with no connection to republicanism, have never heard about, or know little about him, if they had.However, “Big Bobby”, as his closest friend for decades, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, generally called him, never wanted to be known by people at large, just by his own.Within the Sinn Féin and IRA family, he was viewed as a top commander – involved from his youth in the Troubles, with years behind bars, and a place at the top table right up to very recently when illness forced him from the scene.The two people he most admired, as he said himself, were Che Guevara and Gerry Adams. “He was grafted on to Adams,” was one well-put portrayal of their relationship.Studying his history, Storey, who was the IRA’s director of intelligence in the eyes of those who knew that world well, was “a planner, operator and an enforcer”.Illustrating that latter side to him, one former police officer, recalled a beating delivered by Storey to another republican who had dared to challenge the Adams-McGuinness leadership at one of key moments in the peace process.“The man was a repeat murderer, with a penchant for cutting people’s throats, but even he was scared of Bobby Storey,” the former officer recalled.Though he rarely took the microphone outside of speaking to usually-private, sometimes public Sinn Féin gatherings, Storey was able to come up with the memorable quote when he had to go to the front of the stage.One such moment came during a west Belfast press conference in August 2015 attended by Adams, the late Martin McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and some other leading republicans.Matters were then fraught. Kevin McGuigan had just been shot dead in Belfast in a revenge murder for the killing of senior IRA figure Gerard “Jock” Davison that May.Storey had been arrested for the McGuigan murder, but released without charge. The killing threatened the already shaky Northern Executive. Storey insisted that the IRA had had nothing to do with it.The then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton had said some IRA members carried out McGuigan’s murder, although they had acted without the authority of the leadership. Storey’s denials were treated with scepticism.“I think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the IRA being the caterpillar that is still there,” waxed Storey. “What I think is that it’s moved on, it’s become a butterfly, it’s flew away, it’s gone, it’s disappeared.”The butterfly metaphor, which prompted a smile from Adams, had the colloquial colour and rhythm of a remark from one who could talk softly because they carried a big stick.Storey was a “made man” in the IRA from his teens. In 1979, when in his early 20s, he was sent to London to try to free the late IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton prison using a helicopter.It failed and Storey and three others were arrested. He was acquitted but in 1981 was sentenced to 18 years in prison over a gun attack on British soldiers.That led to the Maze prison escape of 1983 and the beginning of Storey making his way into republican legend. Storey and North Belfast Assembly member Gerry Kelly were two of the masterminds in what was the biggest jailbreak in UK prison history, dubbed by republicans, The Great Escape, after the film. In all 38 IRA prisoners made it out of the prison gates in September 1983, half were recaptured but 19 got away.Storey, too, was caught and had another seven years added to his sentence. Prison officer James Ferris who was stabbed during the escape died, although a court later ruled that it was a heart attack that killed him.Storey in a 2008 interview with the republican paper An Phoblacht recalled the escape. “It was a great achievement for the IRA. It showed the degree to which comrades could work together, not just those who escaped but those who formed the back-up inside the jail, prisoners who weren’t going on the escape. Then there was the teamwork of people outside the jail: the drivers, the safe houses. Even getting captured didn’t dampen the event. We shafted Maggie Thatcher.”Storey probably is best known for the 2004 Northern Bank robbery. Adams and the IRA denied that the IRA did the job, and there are people who accept that denial, but not many.Carried out on December 20th, 2004 at the Northern Bank\u0027s headquarters at\u0026nbspDonegall Square\u0026nbspWest\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspBelfast, Northern Ireland, the robbers seized £26.5 m sterling, along with smaller amounts of other currents - the biggest bank robbery in British history.The families of two Northern Bank officials were held at gunpoint on the night before while they were forced the following morning to report for work, as normal. One of the officials was forced to bring out £1m in cash stuffed into a holdall in a test run for the main robbery later that night. The two officials were forced to grant access to the robbers later that night into the bank, which had huge sums of cash in the vault in readiness to fill ATMs. Following the raid, Northern Bank recalled\u0026nbsp£300m worth of banknotes worth £10 or more, and issued new ones with new logos and new serial numbersThe robbery had been months in the planning, coming shortly after a failed attempt to resurrect the powersharing Executive and Assembly which had collapsed in 2002.Intelligence and security services put Storey at the heart of its planning. “The robbery was carried out by the Belfast brigade, and Storey was a key player in the brigade, so he would have been up to his neck in it,” said a former senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer.It should be remembered that the IRA was on ceasefire at the time and supposed to have eschewed such criminality. The same source recalled how over the years the IRA engaged in numerous bank, post office and other robberies. When Border fuel laundering and other activity was taken into account it all amounted to a multimillion pound criminal empire.It prompted the late and former IRA member Dolours Price to comment at the time about slipping republican “standards” and to wonder: “The war is over, we are told . . . so what is all this money needed for?”It is a question that has never been properly answered.Storey had been involved in major robberies before. Stung by multiple truck hijackings in the early 2000s Gallaher’s cigarette manufacturers in Ballymena began to ship supplies bound for Dublin first to Liverpool by ferry, and then onwards to Dublin.The change soon drew the attention of the IRA to Gallaher’s use of Belfast port. In a raid in June 2001 that never drew the attention of the Northern Bank robbery, the IRA targeted a £4 million consignment of cigarettes bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The planning was impeccable, even in the words today of security sources. The Belfast brigade of the IRA provided the people, the IRA in south Armagh handled the logistics, while Storey was at the centre of the web.“One night about 30 men appeared in Belfast dock. They took over the entire dock. They knew exactly what they were doing, they knew exactly what containers they were looking for, they knew exactly where those containers would be,” said one source.“The only mistake they made was that they were a little bit late and a couple of those containers were loaded by the time they got to the quayside. So they put a gunman in the cab of the crane with the crane driver and made him unload them again.“A fleet of lorries then appeared provided by the south Armagh brigade. The containers were dropped onto the lorries which headed off for the Border. The IRA held up the dock for another four hours, and then disappeared.“By the time the alarm was raised I reckon some of those cigarettes were almost in Cork. Bobby Storey would have been at the heart of that as well.”If the Gallaher’s raid made few headlines, the Northern Bank raid dominated bulletins across the world. Anxious to keep the IRA on board British prime minister Tony Blair’s “peace train” played down charges that the IRA was responsible for the cigarette job.“But it was absolutely obvious who did it. No organisation in Northern Ireland had the capability to do that job but the IRA,” said one security source involved in the investigation.Then there was the St Patrick’s night break-in in 2002 at the PSNI special branch offices at the Castlereagh police complex in east Belfast, supposedly one of the most impenetrable security centres in Europe. Three smartly-dressed men, one reputedly with an Oxbridge accent, almost casually got through the various checks, flashing what appeared to be genuine security passes.It was a Sunday, a quiet night, and the men walked along the corridors of the building, just as IRA men did in the Belfast docks raid, knowing exactly where they were to go.Within minutes, the three men were in the office where information about police agents, their police handlers and other highly-confidential documentation were kept.They got out with that hoard just as easily as they got in, a lone constable in the office being punched in the face and then hooded, bound and gagged as the three carefully and methodically assembled their haul.Millions of pounds were spent rehousing compromised detectives and others whose security was threatened by the break-in.Highly embarrassed, then chief constable Ronnie Flanagan referred to the Castlereagh raid as “an inside job”, giving rise to speculation that this was some sort of faction fight between the different elements of British intelligence. But it then emerged that Flanagan appeared to be referring to someone in Castlereagh assisting the three well-dressed robbers.The IRA denied involvement while senior Sinn Féiners complained of dirty deeds by “British securocrats”, to use a favourite and much-used phrase of Adams.Whitehall mandarin Sir John Chilcot, who later investigated the causes of the Iraq war, conducted an inquiry and found no evidence that any section of the British security agencies was involved.Once more Storey was blamed. Remembering the raid, a former senior police officer has no doubts but that he was central. However, that same source believes that Storey was criticised internally by at least one Sinn Féin leader who, whatever about the haul of information found at the break-in, was unhappy with its timing because it put pressure on the Northern Executive and Assembly.The then Ulster Unionist Party first minister David Trimble was under severe strain at the time for sharing power with Sinn Féin. Allegations that the on-ceasefire IRA had broken Castlereagh did nothing for his temperament, or his position.Storey was seen as a man who had “sleepers” in many sensitive positions who could be used at opportune times. Storey, this inidual believes, had “an asset” with knowledge of Castlereagh and that he decided to “use that asset, rather than lose it”. Not every element of the republican movement was kept in the loop by a man who kept secrets well.Storey was said to run a meticulous, almost obsessive intelligence gathering operation. Every IRA brigade in Northern Ireland, possibly apart from south Armagh which tended to do its own thing, supplied information to him.He carefully collated and stored it, much of it in a large bag, a “bit like a Gladstone bag”, according to the source. It was described in court as a “rucksack”.“Republicans were reporting back intelligence all the time, picking up information on prison officers, on police officers, taking down car registrations, getting family details, where children went to school, getting gossip about people’s finances, who was having affairs – all of it being fed back to Bobby,” he explained.It was around then, said the same source, that the PSNI devised a plan to bring him down. And here the story gets convoluted but it all leads up to Stormontgate in October of 2002.StormontgateThat month a long line of PSNI special branch and regular officers trooped into the offices of Sinn Féin at Parliament Buildings and seized material. Amid allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont – hence Stormontgate – Trimble could no longer hold his people together and the whole powersharing structure came crashing down, not to be rebuilt for close to another five years – an occasion in which Storey also featured.Sinn Féin’s head of administration at Stormont, Denis Donaldson was arrested, as were two other men, Donaldson’s son-in-law Ciarán Kearney, and William Mackessy. Storey’s “big bag” – stored in Donaldson’s home – was seized during a PSNI raid.They faced a range of charges but gradually some of them were withdrawn. In December 2005, the prosecution case ended, lawyers reporting it was no longer in the “public interest” to proceed with the case – a term that not infrequently is shorthand for protecting undercover sources or agents.The following day, Friday, December 9th, Donaldson posed with Adams and McGuinness on the steps of Parliament Buildings, the three looking rather self-satisfied.That did not last long. The following week a forlorn Donaldson gave a statement to the press admitting that for about 20 years he had acted as a British agent. At Stormont Donaldson came across as a quiet and decent inidual who kept to the background. On that day he appeared pitiful. He went to live a life of isolation in a cottage near Glenties in Co Donegal where he was brutally murdered the following April. One of his arms was almost blown off by a shotgun blast. The Real IRA said it had killed him, but there are still questions over whether that was a genuine admission.The outing of Donaldson allowed Adams and other Sinn Féiners to claim the whole Stormontgate affair was yet another example of a British “securocrat” conspiracy and that there was no republican spying at Stormont.Again some people believe that version of events. The other story, as expressed by a number of security, official and other sources, was that the police were trying to get Storey in possession of that bag of secret documents. Revenge was required for Castlereagh.In fact, said the former PSNI officer, the operation to nab Storey and other senior republicans had run for a long period. It was costly and involved many officers. But they just could not get the bag and Storey together. The PSNI for a long time knew Donaldson had the bag but were hoping for a “pass the parcel” moment when it would be handed over to the IRA director of intelligence.The source explained: “The bag had been left temporarily with Denis Donaldson. It was destined for Bobby and we were trying to catch Bobby with it, with all those intelligence records and CDs, but we couldn’t in the end. Eventually it got to the stage where we ran out of resources and had to move on it and take Denis instead.”One of the explanations for Donaldson’s arrest, even though he was an agent, was that he had not told his handlers about all the secret documentation. Another reason for the police moving in was fear that the material would be transported for safer keeping across the Border.The result was that Storey escaped the net while millions of pounds were spent trying to safeguard the estimated 2,000 or so people, many of them prison, police and British army officers, some of them politicians, named in the documents.The former officer also recalled how police did not get a chance to contact one particular man, an alleged drug dealer, on the list. “He was killed by the IRA, using one of its cover names, before he could be warned.”LoyaltySpeaking after his death, Adams was strong in his tribute to Storey, saying that he was “one of the bravest people I have ever had the honour to know”.“Whether inside or outside of prison, or through the years of harassment and beatings, arrests and torture from the RUC and British army, Big Bobby demonstrated time and time again his enormous personal commitment and courage,” he added.In turn Storey had a fierce loyalty to Adams. In 2014, when Adams was arrested and questioned at Antrim police station for a number of days about the 1972 abduction, murder and secret burial of mother-of-10 Jean McConville, Storey rallied to his cause.“That they would dare touch our party leader, the leader of Irish republicanism,” Storey thundered at a public gathering in west Belfast. At the same meeting Storey repeated a famous line from Adams about the IRA: “We have a message for the British government, for the Irish government, for the cabal that is out there: we ain’t gone away, you know.”During research for this article, several political, security and republican sources have emphasised how critical Storey was to the peace process and strategy pursued by Adams and McGuinness. They provided the strategy, he provided the muscle to ensure they got their way.Following the August 1994 IRA ceasefire, senior Sinn Féiners went to IRA units across Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, to argue for the peace strategy. Encouraged to speak up, a couple of IRA volunteers attending a meeting close to the Markets in central Belfast did so, and expressed their opposition to the ceasefire.“During all of this Bobby sat at the back of the room,” said one well-placed source. “As the crowd were filtering out Bobby took those speakers aside and explained to them in words of one syllable what the consequences would be if they ever challenged the Adams-McGuinness leadership again. Bobby could be vicious, and they knew that.”One very senior security figure was certain that Storey was important in ensuring that those within the IRA and Sinn Féin who opposed Adams and McGuinness never got the upper hand.“We always believed that Bobby Storey was director of intelligence in the late 1990s and early noughties for the IRA,” he said. “He was very much a key player, extremely close to the leadership. His support for them was pretty vital in containing any iniduals within the organisation who were threatening to throw over the traces, because they were all terrified of him.”“I have no doubt that he played a positive role in making sure that any dissent within the organisation was suppressed,” he added.“He would have been fairly free with his fists when he had to. There were many, many people in the organisation who were frightened of him. If he came around and supported the party leadership then there would be very few people who would cross him.”At the funeral Adams quipped that he did not know anyone who knew Storey “who didn’t like him – except for MI5, MI6, the old RUC, the British army, and prison governors”. Still, he was not universally loved, even within republicanism.In addition to those he threatened, there were other Republicans who had little time for Storey. One in particular was former IRA leader Ivor Bell who last year in court was cleared of soliciting McConville’s murder.That case centred on testimony Bell gave on the Boston tapes – the ill-fated oral history of the Troubles – where it was alleged that one night in 1972, Bell, the late Pat McClure and Adams gathered to settle the terrible end of the life of Jean McConville.Adams, who also gave evidence to the court, insisted no such meeting took place and that he had no part in the murder of the 38-year-old widow.But in the tapes, where former IRA man Anthony McIntyre interviewed Bell, mention also is made of Storey. The court heard that when the IRA and Sinn Féin decided to assist in locating the bodies of McConville and others of the Disappeared Adams sent Storey to speak to Bell. This would have been around 1998-1999.Storey’s task, it appeared from the tapes, was to elicit from Bell what he knew about the Disappeared. But it was clear that Bell felt that Adams was being disingenuous, which led to an infuriated Bell describing Storey as a “clown” and an “idiot” – terms that very few people would have used about him.A clearly annoyed Bell said that he told Storey, “What are you asking me about it for, sure my knowledge of it would be second-hand, why don’t you ask Gerry?”“Oh Gerry knows nothing about it,” Storey told Bell with an exasperated Bell saying to McIntyre, “the annoying thing is he actually believed Gerry.”Storey was loved within most of the republican community but as with Bell there were those who despised him.In July 2018, dissident republicans threw explosive devices at the homes of Adams and Storey in West Belfast. No one was injured. A rally there was quickly organised, with Storey telling dissidents they needed to “go back to where they come from”. “They were on a road to nowhere,” was a message he repeated on a number of occasions.YouthFrom teenage years Storey’s whole life was given over to the IRA and Sinn Féin. He joined the IRA when he was 16. Aged 17, he was one of the youngest to be interned in 1973. He served more than 20 years in prison, quite a lot of them on remand on various charges such as IRA shootings and bombings. Several sources said he was implicated in a number of killings but that because he was so long inside that he is rarely linked to some of the even more notorious multiple-death IRA gun and bomb attacks.“Then there was the massacre on Bloody Sunday when 13 people were gunned down . . . The fact that British paratroopers could gun down innocent protesters had a massive impact on me and from that point on I was attempting to join the republican movement.”Through the 2000s and as the IRA, to a relative degree considering the criminality, retreated into the shadows Sinn Féin leaders such as Adams saw the merit of bringing Storey more into the political fold. They tested the waters first by seeing how he would perform. On one occasion The  and other newspapers were invited to an off-the-record briefing where Storey, a little self-effacingly and with some reluctance, offered his thoughts on whatever was the political issue of that day. “I am not used to this,” he said, but then chatted away. There were no other such invitations for sit-down meetings with Storey.Tall, strongly-built, and with a commanding presence, Storey could be affable man, and with a good sense of humour. Equally, it was clear that he was not one to be crossed.His civility did not stretch to all journalists. The Belfast writer and journalist Malachi O’Doherty, who has been a regular critic of Sinn Féin and the IRA, remembers how in the mid-1990s he was tackled by Storey after he had delivered a piece on BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programme in which he referred to Storey’s “enforcer” status.Storey was 6ft 5in. O’Doherty is 5ft 2in, or little more. O’Doherty had been attending a lecture in the Felons’ Club in west Belfast when Storey approached him. O’Doherty recalled: “He put me up against a wall and told me I was a slug and not welcome in west Belfast.”“After that incident another journalist went to speak to him and said, ‘Look what’s the score with Malachi?’ And he said, ‘Well, Malachi shouldn’t feel that he is free to just walk into west Belfast given that he has been so critical of us’.”This was not a teasing, semi-jocular act by Storey, says O’Doherty: “Oh, no, it was clear intimidation of a journalist.”Some people have characterised Storey as little more than an IRA hardman who carried out the orders given to him and who could barely think for himself. McIntyre, who spent time in prison with him and who was no friend of the Adams-McGuinness leadership, and who himself took some serious gyp from Storey, strongly contradicts that view.He recalled occasions in prison when inmates were shown films. “I hated sitting beside him because no matter how complicated the plot of the film he’d work it out immediately and ruin it for you,” he said.“He was very competent and very well got. He was absolutely hated by the cops, they absolutely despised him.“He was exceptionally bright. I never found Bobby thuggish or a bully in a personal sense although a whole lot of others did. Whenever he was talking he always carried the authority of the IRA.”“In terms of practical intelligence and practical ability you would meet nobody brighter. People used to say to me, ‘He is stupid’, and I would say back to them, ‘You are stupid for thinking he is stupid’. You don’t put operations like that together if you are stupid.”Journalist Ivan Little while writing about Storey paramilitary past in the Belfast  also had a memory about his “softer” side. “At a talent contest I hosted in west Belfast some years ago he and his mother watched with pride as Storey’s brother Brian who had Down’s syndrome stole the show as an Elvis impersonator,” he recalled.But there are few such anecdotes.Across the Border he was also very well known to senior Garda and Army intelligence officers. “He was certainly on our radar he figured a lot in our intelligence reports down the years, he was an interesting character,” said one former Garda source.And while Storey is seldom mentioned as being on the IRA Army Council a former Army intelligence source said the view in the South was that “he was on the army council, or very close to it”.“Membership of the army council was fluid we think he was on it for a while. Storey was very influential. He mostly stayed behind the scenes but we had him at the very top of the tree,” he said.That 2008 An Phoblacht interview was another example of Storey’s switch from paramilitarism to politics although one security source said that even in his Sinn Féin days “he was somewhere between the two”.He held a senior position for Sinn Féin at Stormont and also served as party chairman for a period. He was a prominent backroom figure at times of political crises and during elections. He could energise the footsoldiers when the vote had to be got out. Perhaps jaundiced by the necessity to deal with journalists it seemed, however, that elected politics was not for him.In his graveside oration Adams spoke about how Storey was devoted to his partner, Teresa, their children, and grandchildren, brothers Seamus and Brian, and sister Geraldine.One of the repeated arguments from senior British security figures and some unionist politicians over the years is that a chief reason for the IRA finally ending its “war” was because it was so riddled with and damaged by informers and agents, some of them operating at very elevated levels such as Donaldson and Freddie Scappaticci, also known as Stakeknife, and some purported high-rankers yet to be exposed.Differing viewsThere are different views of Storey. Most unionists and many others will see him as just another ruthless terrorist who was part of an IRA murder machine that killed up to 1,800 people and badly injured thousands more in an unjustifiable and unnecessary conflict.That view was reflected in a piece in the Belfast  on the day before the funeral by historian Ruth Dudley Edwards which was headlined: “Bobby Storey: a violent thug who played role in the collapse of Stormont on three occasions”.The counter view was offered in that same day’s Irish News where senior republican Jim Gibney wrote: “If it is possible for one inidual to embody the spirit, the dynamic, the duration and durability, the depth and complexity of the republican struggle over the last 45 years then it was Bobby Storey.”But in the often dispassionate warts and all world of the British and Irish intelligence and security services that battled with Storey and his like there remains an objective regard for his nerve and skill.That same former Stormont official had one lasting memory of Storey that acknowledged his place in the republican hierarchy and in the “long war” tussle between the competing forces. It was May 2007, two months after Adams and Ian Paisley after much coaxing from the British and Irish governments, struck their truly historic deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. This was after close to five years of direct rule from Westminster and now finally powersharing was being reinstated.While below in the chamber the politicians went about the business of formally reactivating the Executive and Assembly, in the visitors’ gallery above the likes of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Blair and other VIPs observed proceedings, enjoying some of the reflected light of a job well done.Just a few seats from them sat three of the most senior IRA figures of the Troubles, the late Brian Keenan, Brian Gillen and Bobby Storey.“This is how central he was to PIRA and also to the peace process – while it would have infuriated unionists, their presence was a vindication of the Adams strategy and the peace process,” said the former official.He said that Blair and some of the other dignitaries “probably wouldn’t have recognised Storey anyway, which again says something about him”.And in a neat encapsulation of Storey’s significant but in many way reticent place in republican history and in the peace process he added: “He was very low profile, as befits an intelligence person – he was an observer.“But I do remember the respect my intelligence colleagues had for his operations. Quite apart from the Maze breakout to have planned the Northern Bank robbery and the Castlereagh break-in was extraordinary: respectively one of the largest bank robberies in history and the single biggest breach of UK national security ever. Quite a CV and he certainly didn’t lack ambition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4301819.1594409615!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin city council proposes 15m swimming pool and sauna at george s dock","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe proposed swimming pool is planned for close to the Sean O’Casey Bridge at  George’s Dock. File photograph: Nick Bradshaw The Dublin City councillors will meet online on Tuesday to discuss plans for a heated swimming pool at the Liffey.The plans, from the council’s docklands unit, envisage a €15m swimming pool close to the Sean O’Casey pedestrian bridge and near George’s Dock, where the council also plans a €22 million, white-water rafting centre. The heated swimming pool would, according to plans sent to councillors, complement visitor attractions including the Jeanie Johnston famine ship and the Epic Diaspora Museum.Plans envisage a 50-metre outdoor pool, sauna, yoga classes, a cafe and corporate meeting facilities.The idea is modelled on the successful Allas Spa complex in Helsinki and backers say it could be developed by the private sector on a 30-year lease from the council, generating more than €100 million in that time. However, members of the council’s Central Area Committee and the North Wall Community Association have expressed reservations.While “not wanting to pour cold water on the scheme” Councillor Nial Ring said: “I will not be rushing out to buy new speedos”. Mr Ring said there were “bays and fine beaches” on the coast either side of the Liffey, “what do we need a swimming pool in the Liffey for”, he asked. The former Lord Mayor said a public consultation had been held, on what locals wanted in the area. “Nobody said a swimming pool in the Liffey. Why can they not come up with something the public said they wanted” he asked. The Northwall Community Association gave the proposal an even damper reception. In a statement on Friday the community said “this proposal is not acceptable” given the immediate needs in the locality. The statement said: “The long established after schools  creche group in Sheriff Street is in urgent need of a premises to accommodate the 64 pre-school children and 12 workers that look after them. “There is a recently vacated Fás training centre in Sheriff Street that we’re told requires at least €1 million to make it functional for the after schools but there’s no sign of that happening. “Yet at the same time its deemed suitable, to pardon the pun, splash the cash on a super size hot tub. This is completely unacceptable to the local community. We need urgent immediate help for 64 young children and instead we’re getting a whirlpool,” the statement concluded.

He is practising outside his home in the Fountain in Derry. Photograph: Trevor McBride As the newest – and youngest – member of the William King Memorial Flute Band, 10-year-old Jonathan Thompson should have been looking forward to marching in his first Twelfth of July parade. Instead, like many bandsmen and members of the Orange Order in Northern Ireland and in the Republic, he will be celebrating the “Twelfth” not by marching through the streets, but by staying at home. Instead, the call is to celebrate “online, in your home or at your door”, although, in another anomaly this year, because it falls on a Sunday, the Twelfth will instead be celebrated on Monday 13th. A four-day virtual programme of events is on the order’s website, and a new radio station, Radio Boyne, will broadcast music, speeches and services. “It definitely won’t be the same,” says Kyle Thompson, the district master of the City of Londonderry No 4 Loyal Orange Lodge. “It is a bit disappointing, but over the last few months we haven’t been able to do all the things we would normally do, and it’s for the greater good. It’s the way it has to be.” Cultural cornerstoneJust as for his younger brother Jonathan, the Twelfth has been part of Kyle Thompson’s life since he was a child. “It’s the cornerstone of the culture and history of our community and a celebration of our civil and religious freedoms, but it’s also a family occasion when people come together. There’s nothing else in the world like it.” Derek Moore agrees. “How do you do a virtual Twelfth?” he laughs. “It’s pretty difficult.” A senior member of the William King Memorial Flute Band, he is also co-ordinator of the North West Cultural Partnership, which runs the New Gate Arts and Culture Centre in Derry’s Fountain estate, the last remaining Protestant area on the city’s west bank. Under normal circumstances, it runs a two-week festival each summer. This year, the New Gate Fringe festival team have put together a series of short films exploring how the Twelfth will be celebrated in Derry and Strabane. Other local events include an online Twelfth hosted by the nearby Sollus centre, in Bready, Co Tyrone. More than 200 bands have made applications to the Parades Commission to hold small, socially distanced parades of no more than 30 people – the maximum number currently allowed to gather outside under the coronavirus regulations in force in Northern Ireland – in their local areas. But the bandsmen of the William King have decided to stay at home. Cancellation was “totally the right decision”, says Moore. “The pandemic is not over, and there’s no way anybody should be on the streets. I’m married to a nurse, so I know.“I understand people wanting to get out,” says Moore, “but we couldn’t control anything outside of the band, and we didn’t want to put anybody at risk. On the road you risk pulling a sizeable crowd along with you.” ‘A bit of a buzz’In Newbuildings, Co Derry, the Pride of Orange and Blue Flute Band will play in their local area. “People are set up to sit in their own home and wait for the band to come to them,” explains the band’s president, Kenny McFarland. He is confident the public will stay at home. “This is bringing the band to you.”Other events to encourage people to stay indoors have also been organised, including a competition for the best-decorated house. “There are more houses decorated with flags, and there’s a bit of a buzz about the place now,” says McFarland. “When it was cancelled people weren’t happy. They didn’t know what to do, because nobody has any expectation of not having the Twelfth. But once the rules moved to 30 people, that gave the bands an opportunity. People want to see and hear bands on the Twelfth.” The number of bands applying to march rose following the controversy over the funeral of former IRA member Bobby Storey in Belfast on June 30th, which appeared to break both social-distancing guidelines and the coronavirus regulations. Work also restarted at some bonfire sites in east Belfast, which had previously been cleared of wood following an agreement to call off the bonfires traditionally held on the Eleventh Night, though at least one of these sites has subsequently been cleared. He believes the majority will follow the rules. “No doubt there’ll be examples, people will say that was done, this was done, but I think the intent of the institutions and the bands and the wider unionist community is to celebrate within the regulations.” Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Move after Japan\u0026rsquos capital records highest daily cases \u0026ndash 224 \u0026ndash since pandemic beganInfluential sister of Kim Jong-un says meeting makes no sense without reward for PyongyangMayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Health officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"scientists hail stunning results show areas new york may have","story":"Areas of New York have recorded a nearly 70 per cent rate of immunity to Covid-19, in what scientists have described as “stunning” findings that suggest they could be protected from any second wave.Some 68 per cent of people who took antibody tests at a clinic in the Corona neighbourhood of Queens received positive results, while at another clinic in Jackson Heights, 56 per cent tested positive. The results, shared by healthcare company CityMD with the New York Times, appear to show a higher antibody rate than anywhere in the world, based on publicly released data.The next closest is the Italian province of Bergamo, which recorded 57 per cent, followed by Alpine ski resort Ischgl, the site of Austria\u0027s biggest coronavirus outbreak, which reported 47 per cent.Emergency doctors in New York told the  on Thursday that the rates confirmed what they had been seeing clinically in lower income areas of the city which had high minority populations.Dr Daniel Frogel, a senior vice president for operations at CityMD, which plays a key role in the New York City’s testing program, suggested that some communities may have already achieved herd immunity. However, virologists cautioned that the results may not be representative of the general population as the testing was carried out at urgent care centres. They also warned that not enough data exists to conclude anything on herd immunity.New York is among the hardest-hit cities in the world, recording some 222,000 cases and nearly 23,000 deaths to date.Less affluent areas of the boroughs of Queens and the Bronx, which have a high proportion of Hiic and black residents and lower-income essential workers, have been worst affected. It was reported on Thursday that a staggering 74 parishoners at one Roman Catholic church in Queens have died from the coronavirus.Wealthier areas recorded much lower rates, according to CityMD data. For example, at a clinic in Cobble Hill, a mostly white and wealthy neighbourhood in Brooklyn, only 13 per cent of people tested positive for antibodies.The results suggest higher-income neighbourhoods may bear the brunt of any second wave to hit the city.CityMD administered about 314,000 antibody tests in New York City, as of June 26. Citywide, 26 per cent of the tests came back positive.New York State released its own figures at the height of the outbreak in early May, which showed the city\u0027s positive rate hovering around 20 per cent, while the Bronx on its own recorded a 34 per cent positive rate.Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, called the high positive rate in Corona “a stunning finding.” However, she said it would be a mistake to base public health decisions off antibody rates across a population.The “magical number for herd immunity assumes that everyone infected has complete protection from a second infection. But what about people with partial protection?” she told the NYT. “They may not get sick, but they can get infected and pass it along.”Prof Denis Nash, an epidemiology professor at the CUNY School of Public Health, added that he thought the concept of herd immunity was more applicable to closed populations, unlike New York City neighbourhoods. “People from Corona, for example, who are testing negative will still be getting on the subways and going to other neighbourhoods where there may be more transmission, he told The . “We have to be careful about applying simple epidemiological concepts to complex settings.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive st andrews university fraternity suspends members","story":"A US-style fraternity at the University of St Andrews has suspended a number of members over allegations of more than a dozen rapes and sexual assaults.An investigation by The  has found at least nine separate rape claims made against students in the St Andrews\u0027 branch of Alpha Epsilon Pi.Now, police and the university have urged victims to come forward and vowed to take any perpetrators to court.Speaking to the , one female student opened up about her shocking experience in February this year.“I had been at a frat party and got very drunk. One of the boys I knew said he’d walk me home. I thought he was someone I could trust. “He put me to bed and the next thing I remember is waking up to him raping me. I ran out and I was in quite a state. I ended up locking myself behind the bathroom door because I didn\u0027t want to go out.”The young woman has not reported the incident to the university or the police, but has spoken to a counsellor.“It’s difficult when you know these people are still going to be around and I\u0027m still going to see them. I obviously want them to get what they deserve, but I\u0027ve just sort of been debating the best way to do that and how to go about it.”The group, which is made up of around 50 young men, known as brothers, said in a statement on July 3: “Earlier today, Alpha Epsilon Pi St Andrews was made aware of allegations of sexual assault, harassment, and rape against multiple members of our fraternity, including incidents at chapter events. We find the contents of these allegations abhorrent, and are taking them extremely seriously.”The fraternity - which is predominantly made up of Jewish members “immediately suspended people who acknowledged any role in the alleged incidents and entered them into Alpha Epsilon Pi\u0027s expulsion process.”They say they will work with the police, the university and any victims to ensure that justice can be served.But women who spoke to the  say that while it is understood that two people have been suspended, the problem has been going on for years.“In their statement they said they had been unaware of the accusations, but I know concretely that they knew about them,” one assault victim said.“Last academic year I made it clear to them that I and my best friend are survivors of sexual assault by AEPi, and they did not seem to take that to mean anything. As a Jewish woman and survivor, it is heartbreaking that they are representing the Jewish community in such a disgusting way.”The fraternity said: “As a Jewish fraternity, one of the values of our teachings we hold most important is that all human beings are fashioned B\u0027tzelem Elohim, in the image of God. “Therefore, it is wrong to treat anybody without dignity, no matter their gender, race, sexual orientation or religion. This obviously applies to sexual assault and harassment.”But other female students also claim to have had distressing experiences.The  was told how one young woman was on a night out and became panicked when she saw a man who had sexually assaulted her months before. A member of the fraternity who was with her offered to take her home and calm her down. He offered to sleep on the floor, but she woke up to him groping her in her bed. “It was the ultimate betrayal of trust,” her friend said.Other claims have come to light on an Instagram page set up last week for sexual assault survivors at the university.“On the first day that the account was made, over 100 stories were submitted to us,” the administrator said.A dozen of those allegations were made against members of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, although the true number is thought to be higher.The account was started by an inidual, but is now managed by a team of people. “Our message to survivors is that they are not alone, we hear them and most of all we believe them,” they said.This is not the first time that Alpha Epsilon Pi has been embroiled in sexual assault claims. Within the last few years, there have been allegations made against members at Ohio State university, Penn State university, the University of Illinois and Vanderbilt University.In February, Ari Goldstein, the 23-year-old president of Temple University’s AEPi fraternity in Philadelphia was found guilty of attempted sexual assault and sent to prison.There are four other branches at UK universities, including Leeds, Birmingham, Nottingham and London, but they have not been accused of wrongdoing.St Andrews, where Prince William and Kate Middleton studied, made clear that the fraternity is not an official university society but that any student was expected to follow their code of conduct and the law.A spokeswoman for the University said: “We welcome the ‘St Andrews Survivors’ account’s efforts to provide people of all genders a space to voice their experiences of sexual misconduct. “The University’s primary concern is to ensure survivors know that we are ready and willing to support their decisions and take action, facilitate Police reporting, and provide ongoing support accordingly.“We have clear and established procedures for investigating allegations of this nature. However, the details of any investigations must remain confidential to offer appropriate support and fair outcomes to all concerned. It would not be appropriate for us to comment on whether any specific inidual or group is under investigation.”“The University will always act when incidents are formally reported, and is committed to working collaboratively with students to promote a culture of responsibility and respect, in which everyone can trust in our procedures and that our community is intolerant of all forms of sexual misconduct.”Yvonne Stenhouse, Police Scotland’s Community Inspector for North East Fife, told the : “We are aware of these online reports and are working with the university to make sure students in St Andrews feel safe while they live and study in the town.“We are committed to bringing sexual offenders before the courts and treat all reports of sexual crime with the utmost seriousness. Anyone wishing to report such offences should do so to Police Scotland by calling 101 or 999 in an emergency.“Within busy town centres, such as St Andrews we have regular deployments of officers to deter such offences and provide a visible and reassuring presence to our communities. We will continue to work with the University on this matter and any criminal complaints will be progressed accordingly.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ilya khrzhanovsky apology","story":"On 23 April 2020 we published an article headed “Ukrainian prosecutors investigate Dau film project over alleged torture of children”.

The Chancellor told us all to go out for dinner and spend. Then the transaction figures came out showing that spending on “Super Saturday”, the day hospitality venues reopened, was still about 50 per cent down on last year. He told us to hire staff, and offered thousands to businesses to avoid lay-offs. Hours later, fresh job cuts at John Lewis brought the total lay-off tab at major British firms to almost 70,000 and counting.It isn’t working and it isn’t going to work because the problem isn’t a lack of Government grants or tax cuts. The problem is that we still don’t know whether the pandemic is nearly over or just beginning. The only thing we know for sure is that our Government still cannot manage it. Mr Sunak is like a slicker who shows up at the economy’s hospital bed with a big fat cheque. “You’ve just won £350 billion!” he exclaims. “Thank you, sir,” says the patient. “Can the doctor tell me now if I am going to die?”For consumers to spend and businesses to hire, they need to know that the state can do two things. \u2028First, it needs to be able to contain the virus, using a track and trace system, regular community testing, weekly testing of carers and healthcare workers, and quarantine procedures for care homes. Second, it needs to be able to treat a lot of people in case the containment strategy fails, for which it must retain a high capacity in the health system. The political tipping point for a national lockdown is not actually the death rate, but the possibility of hospitals being overwhelmed and turning away patients or letting them die on trolleys in the corridors. Until the country feels fairly confident that this isn’t going to happen and that we won’t need a lockdown to avoid it, the economy cannot recover.The prospect of fresh lockdowns, national or local, is crippling. Survey data recently cited by Citigroup analysts suggest that eight weeks of lockdown are enough to wipe out the cash reserves of 40 per cent of small businesses in the country. After 12 weeks, 60 per cent run out. This explains why the furlough scheme and its ilk were designed to last a few months, not for repeated crashes, which were almost inconceivable a few months ago. Even in April, the Government was still hoping this was a six-month crisis and its rescue plans assumed that businesses faced a temporary liquidity problem.How long does it take to turn a liquidity crunch into a spiralling chain of insolvencies? We are about to find out. The economy will remain depressed until we reach some sort of herd immunity, either from a vaccine or the natural spread of disease, each of which are probably a year away. In the meantime, not knowing whether or when the old foot traffic will return, city centre restaurants, cafés, gyms, salons, tourist attractions and so on cannot invest and must cut to survive for as long as possible. If the shift to working remotely is semi-permanent, many businesses won’t be viable even after the pandemic.All of this means that the Treasury faces a stark choice. Either it can keep up its liquidity schemes – furlough, loans and grants – for the duration of the pandemic, in the knowledge that vast costs are mounting every month. Or it can accept huge economic damage, thousands of bankruptcies and millions of job losses. My bet is that it will do the former.The scale of the costs so far are such that they will reshape the global economy. This sky-high public debt will be funded, one way or another, by forcing investors to buy Government bonds in order to keep interest costs in check. This is one aspect of FDR’s “new deal” that Boris Johnson was not keen to talk about last week. To finance his spending, Roosevelt simply mandated that US Treasuries would effectively pay negative yields. The corollary to this policy was inflation.For the moment, the world is terrified not by inflation but by the prospect of falling prices, or deflation, due to households sitting at home and not spending. Economists do not know how to reverse deflation, which can spiral into the kind of depression seen in the Thirties, so they find it especially scary. To ward this off, central banks have embarked upon an orgy of money-printing worth about four per cent of global GDP, even more than we saw in 2008.There is a difference this time, however. The new money created in 2008 never made it into the real economy and instead became stuck on bank balance sheets or drove up asset prices, inflating the wealth of the rich while doing little to help most wage-earners. A few years after the last crisis, most governments began to cut spending. This time, there will be no such shrinkage. Rather than letting the new cash sit in banks, the Government is effectively spending it by paying people’s wages. The “modern monetary theorists”, as they call themselves in the US, are getting their wish.For now, consumers are hoarding cash either because they are scared of the virus or cannot find ways to spend. Around them, businesses are slashing costs and going bust. At some point, consumers will come out of their boltholes and begin to spend. With fewer firms around to supply their needs and many supply chains retooled away from China, the result is likely to be a steady rise in inflation. This won’t bother governments, so long as it doesn’t rise too high, because the state can forcibly pin down its own debt costs, using capital controls if necessary, and let everyone else hang. This is where fiscal and monetary policy are headed, whatever Mr Sunak says about meal deals.Suddenly, that slick fellow by the nation’s bedside doesn’t look so friendly after all. It turns out he isn’t the doctor and he isn’t in control of much. All of his options are bad ones. All he can really do is sugar the pill with a cheerful grin and a confident delivery. It’s no wonder he doesn’t want to follow Government advice \u2028and wear a mask indoors.

And a few weeks after the 103-year-old passed away peacefully at her East Sussex home, crowds gathered to hail the ‘forces’ sweetheart’ for one final time as she was laid to rest.After a week of dreary drizzle, it was a sunny day – and one laced with meaning, too, coinciding with the 80thanniversary of the beginning of the Battle of Britain and the Luftwaffe bombing campaign where Dame Vera’s songs would do so much to rally the nation’s spirits.Ahead of the funeral, a giant portrait of Dame Vera was beamed on to the White Cliffs of Dover. By mid-morning hundreds had gathered in the picturesque village of Ditchling where Dame Vera lived for 60 years.Among those lining the streets were neighbours who adored the Dame in their midst, who despite her fame always had time for everyone. Others had come from far and wide. William Baker\u0027s father served with the Royal Navy in the Second World War and was one of the soldiers entertained by Dame Vera, watching her perform on several occasions. She always called them her boys and they loved her in equal measure - so much so that Baker\u0027s father had made him promise before his death 15 years ago that he would attend her funeral on his behalf. “He said that she helped morale in an unimaginable way by coming to see them,” Baker said.The funeral cortege left Dame Vera’s family home shortly before midday and made a slow procession through the village flanked by 12 members from all three armed services, including the Coldstream Guards in full ceremonial dress and the Queen’s Colour Squadron representing the RAF. Dame Vera’s coffin was draped in a Union flag with a bouquet of flowers and her medals resting on top. Among them was the Burma Star which she was awarded in recognition of her morale-boosting tour of the frontline in 1944, where she performed for audiences that ranged from 6,000 to two patients too ill to be moved from a casualty clearing station.One of those she performed to was Captain Sir Tom Moore who ahead of her funeral warmly recalled her visit to Burma. There she was, this lovely English girl… she was a great person to give us a lot more confidence and we were very, very pleased to see her, he said.The 100-year-old also mentioned recently receiving a letter from Dame Vera (a prodigious letter writer up to the very end) praising him for his efforts raising millions for the NHS during lockdown. Speaking for a nation he admitted he “always had a soft spot in my heart for Dame Vera”.As the cortege came to a stop in the middle of the village alongside standard bearers from the Royal British Legion, the bells from St Margaret’s Church rang out and the distinctive roar of the Merlin engines of two Spitfires echoed overhead.The aircraft (belonging to the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight) included the only airworthy Spitfire in existence to have flown against the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain. Flown by the Polish pilot Ludwik Martel, it was shot down on October 25, 1940. Despite being wounded he still managed to crash-land in a field in Hastings. The other Spitfire yesterday bore the black and white livery of the D Day landings.  The aircraft looped twice around the village through the bright blue sky before performing a final flypast over the cortege as it stood at rest. As the cortege made its way out of the village, there were shouts of hip hip hooray from the crowd in Dame Vera\u0027s honour, followed by a spontaneous rendition of her wartime song \u0027We\u0027ll Meet Again\u0027 which has taken on fresh relevance in the modern age and early on in the coronavirus lockdown was quoted in the Queen\u0027s address to the nation.The cortege continued to Brighton Crematorium for a private ceremony for Dame Vera’s family where a bugler from the Royal Marines sounded Last Post. A public memorial event is planned at a later date. Virginia Lewis-Jones, Dame Vera\u0027s daughter, later thanked the nation for its “tremendous support” over the past few weeks. She added: my mother always appreciated receiving messages from all over the world, and Ditchling was always particularly special to her, that is why we know she would be touched that so many people want to pay their respects.Back in Ditchling neighbours spoke warmly of Dame Vera, who before her stellar career took off was a plumber’s daughter from Essex affording her a common touch she never lost. One typical tale of the lack of airs and graces she displayed was during the aftermath of the Great Storm of 1987. Dame Vera was spotted out the following morning in a khaki boiler suit and red bobble hat helping shift the fallen trees from the road.Jane Lantsbury, 67, who has lived in the village since she was born and was among those paying their respects, recalled the many occasions when she and Dame Vera would eat Sunday lunch together in the local pub.She was the first to have a big Yorkshire pudding with all the roast inside,” she said. They called it the Vera Lynn.As fitting for a woman who united a nation, the tributes poured in from every echelon of society. The Queen has been among those to send private messages of condolences to Dame Vera’s family and the Chief of Defence Staff, Sir Nick Carter, hailed her “stirring performances” which “lifted the nation during the darkest of times.”But equally poignant were the simple tributes left by those whose lives she had touched.At the Ditchling war memorial, which bears the names of 13 men from the village killed in the Second World War, an unknown mourner yesterday planted a Union flag in the earth with a message reading: ‘Dame Vera R.I.P.’More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/28/16/supermarket-trolley-groceries.jpg","title":"food prices groceries rise clothing tariffs brexit","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Mince, oranges, cheese and cucumbers among staples to become more expensive, retail trade body saysThe cost of food including beef mince, oranges, cheese and cucumbers will go up from the start of next year if the UK fails to agree a trade deal with the EU, retailers have warned.The British Retail Consortium said prices of clothes, footwear and furniture are also likely to rise, as tariffs are placed on a broad range of imported goods.Poorer households will be hit hardest as they spend a higher proportion of their incomes on essentials which will become more expensive without tariff-free access to the Continent, the BRC said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt is “folly” to think that trade deals with non-EU nations will compensate for costlier imports from the EU, according to the BRC\u0027s report, \u0027Why Tariffs are Bad News for UK Consumers\u0027, released on Friday.The retail industry trade body analysed the UK\u0027s new tariff schedule, finding that 85 per of foods imported from the EU will face tariffs of more than 5 per cent. Brexit talks round breaks up early as \u0027significant ergences\u0027 remainThis includes 48 per cent on beef mince, 16 per cent on cucumbers, and 57 per cent on cheddar cheese. The average tariff on food imported from the EU would be over 20 per cent, the report said.Non-tariff barriers such as additional regulatory checks also risk reducing choice while tight margins for retailers mean that businesses will be forced to pass on some of their additional costs to shoppers, the BRC warned.“The next few months are critical to the living standards of millions of people in the UK, said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC.He added: “For decades, British households have enjoyed great value, quality, and choice, making it a great place to shop. However, without a tariff-free deal with the EU, the public will see higher prices in supermarkets from next year, squeezing millions of families already impacted by the current economic downturn. This is not the fair deal that consumers were promised.“Many UK shoppers experienced disruption in the run up to lockdown without a deal, the public may face an even bigger challenge at the end of the Transition period.““With the clock ticking down to 31st December, the Government must put consumers first and agree a deal that avoids tariffs and minimises the impact of non-tariff barriers.” After the latest round EU-UK trade negotiations ended in London on Thursday, Michel Barnier said that “this week’s discussions confirm that significant ergences remain between the EU and GB. We will continue working with patience, respect and determination.”The EU\u0027s chief negotiator warned businesses on both sides of the Channel to step up their preparations for no-deal disruption.Talks are due to resume in Brussels next week.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The anomalous figures from South America may be due to the pandemic\u0027s effect on already volatile economies, according to Invezz’s David Merry.“The impact that Covid-19 has had on the industry is huge, the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.Many countries such as Russia and China are down as much as half when compared to last year.

As the dictator of Yara, Anton Castillo is intent on restoring his nation back to its former glory by any means, with his son, Diego, following in his bloody footsteps. Their ruthless oppression has ignited a revolution.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe art sees a character that clearly resembles Esposito standing with his hands on the shoulders of a child – presumably, Anton Castillo and his son.According to the post, players will control a character called Dani Rojas, a “Yaran” who becomes a guerrilla fighter to “liberate the nation”.Did Ubisoft just copy Far Cry 4’s map for Far Cry Primal?Far Cry Primal review, PS4, Xbox One: Just like the othersUbisoft to investigate sexual harassment and assault claimsPrevious entries in the Far Cry franchise have been first-person open world shooters set in violence-struck fictional regions of the world. The Far Cry 6 description also says players will be able to “employ makeshift weapons and vehicles”, and stated that this game would represent “the largest Far Cry playground to date”, with environments ning “jungles, beaches and Esperanza, the capital city of Yara”. The game is expected to be formally announced on Sunday (12 July), as part of the Ubisoft Forward event, which people can stream on the internet. In Breaking Bad (and its spin-off series Better Call Saul), Esposito plays the calculating meth baron Gus Fring. The actor has also appeared in Westworld, The Mandalorian, and Dear White People on Netflix.According to the leak, Far Cry 6 will be released in 2021.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brexit talks round breaks up early as \u0027significant ergences\u0027 remainThis includes 48 per cent on beef mince, 16 per cent on cucumbers, and 57 per cent on cheddar cheese. The average tariff on food imported from the EU would be over 20 per cent, the report said.Non-tariff barriers such as additional regulatory checks also risk reducing choice while tight margins for retailers mean that businesses will be forced to pass on some of their additional costs to shoppers, the BRC warned.“The next few months are critical to the living standards of millions of people in the UK, said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC.He added: “For decades, British households have enjoyed great value, quality, and choice, making it a great place to shop. However, without a tariff-free deal with the EU, the public will see higher prices in supermarkets from next year, squeezing millions of families already impacted by the current economic downturn. This is not the fair deal that consumers were promised.“Many UK shoppers experienced disruption in the run up to lockdown without a deal, the public may face an even bigger challenge at the end of the Transition period.““With the clock ticking down to 31st December, the Government must put consumers first and agree a deal that avoids tariffs and minimises the impact of non-tariff barriers.” After the latest round EU-UK trade negotiations ended in London on Thursday, Michel Barnier said that “this week’s discussions confirm that significant ergences remain between the EU and GB. We will continue working with patience, respect and determination.”The EU\u0027s chief negotiator warned businesses on both sides of the Channel to step up their preparations for no-deal disruption.Talks are due to resume in Brussels next week.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSir Patrick Vallance, England’s chief scientific adviser, said last month that the country was approaching a time when the R number would no longer be a useful measure for reproduction, explaining the smaller number of cases would mean local outbreaks could give a skewed impression.Across the whole of the UK, the R number is unchanged between 0.7 and 0.9, showing the outbreak continues to slowly shrink, nationally. The daily growth rate for the whole of the UK has dropped to between -5 per cent and -2 per cent, compared with a rate of -6 per cent to 0 per day last week.Commenting on the UK figures, Professor James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, said: “That the number of cases is falling slightly is to be welcomed.“It has to be emphasised that no one knows what the safe level of relaxation is for the UK and there is a delay between action and consequence.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Michel Barnier has mocked a Tory MP’s protests about the EU’s aims for a post-Brexit trade deal – pointing out he voted for the measures himself.Mark Francois, head of the hardline European Research Group, wrote to the EU’s chief negotiator last month, insisting he must drop his “unreasonable demands”.In a scathing response, Mr Barnier sets out how those “demands” – on adherence to EU rules and the role of the European Court of Justice – were both “agreed” by Boris Johnson, in the Brexit deal.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt was then “voted for by the House of Commons, including yourself, as part of the withdrawal agreement ratification,” he points out.In a letter dripping in sarcasm, Mr Barnier adds: “All we are asking of the UK is to honour its commitments in the political declaration.”Johnson to reject place on EU’s vaccine schemeAn agreement is still possible, he argues – “despite the short time available, which is the choice of your government”.The last point is a reference to the prime minister’s decision to reject an extension to the transition period, threatening both sides with a no-deal Brexit on 31 December.The negotiations remain deadlocked over the flashpoints listed by Mr Barnier, plus fishing rights, the UK insisting that to concede would mean giving up its sovereignty.However, the EU can point to the terms of the political declaration, signed in haste by Mr Johnson last autumn to strike an exit deal and take the UK out of the bloc on 31 January.It agrees that, on any dispute over EU law, “the arbitration panel should refer the question to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) as the sole arbiter of Union law, for a binding ruling”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.The team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The provincial agricultural department said in a statement that the dog meat trade had descended into “anarchy” in recent years, causing rabies and other diseases to spread from region to region.The department said in a statement that the “catching, buying, selling and slaughtering of dogs” would be punished “severely”, with maximum penalties including five years in prison and fines of up to 50 million riel (approximately £9,700).Dr Katherine Polak, head of Four Paws, said: “The historic decision by the Siem Reap government to ban the stealing, trading and killing of dogs is a huge milestone for animal welfare in Cambodia and is reflective of current sentiment among Khmer people.UN warns of ‘steady stream’ of infectious zoonotic diseases‘If we don’t buy, they don’t die’: Tackling the wildlife trade demandCan social media be weaponised against the illegal wildlife trade?Prince William backs report to ‘end the illegal wildlife trade’Yulin Dog Meat Festival: How did it start and will it get banned?“We hope that Siem Reap will serve as a model for the rest of the country to follow suit to protect the lives of millions of dogs.”The dog meat industry in Cambodia sees an estimated three million dogs slaughtered for consumption annually. Thousands of animals are transported from Siem Reap to different parts of the country each month, including to the capital, Phnom Penh.Tea Kimsoth, director of the provincial agriculture, forestry and fisheries department, told Reuters that demand for the meat was driven by foreigners, especially South Korean visitors to the country.“They like it, that’s why it led to restaurants serving it, so now we ban it,” he said, adding that the trade was “alarming”.The Cambodian province’s decision follows China recent ban on the sale of dog and cat meat. The animals were kept in poor conditions, making them vulnerable to disease that could be transmitted to humans, said activists.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Within the Commonwealth those countries continue to share a bond.The Commonwealth emerged in the decolonisation process, through nations that were united in being former colonial states still being able to connect with one another, to share information, to share history, in ious dferent ways.It maintains those connections, but not from a colonial perspective of British rule.This organisation is a symbol of a fresh start for the relationship between nations that were once part of the British Empire.That’s an example of how we can move on from the past – we move on through our actions, by transcending history, by being more than that, by looking towards the future.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She says the gangsters feel empowered by the Russian governments “gay propaganda” laws which have been blamed for a spike in homophobic attacks since .Svetlana, who works for the countrys \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"LGBT Network, said: “In the emails, they say things like you will be next.“The people behind these threats try to claim they have the support of the government.“We are the power and you will be next, is the kind of language they use.”In the last threat she received in April, the group revealed their plans to carry out attacks in countries such as Germany and the Netherlands before “further expansion” throughout the rest of the continent.The email read: “A project of our like-minded people from Europe under the name Kne International starts.“At the moment, the project will be based in five cities, these are Warsaw , Ostrava , Berlin , Kharkovand Arnhemwith further expansion throughout most of Europe.“The main activity of the organisation will be the regulation of LGBT activism in Europe.”Yelena Grigoryeva died after being stabbed multiple times and strangled by a group of men in St Petersburg last July – a murder which has been classied as an anti-LGBT hate crime by leading watchdog the SOVA Center.Yet, the police claim the killing was not motivated by her sexuality despite her name appearing on a “death list” on the Saw site was closed down within days of the murder.The LGBT network insists that cops did not investigate the crime properly although three suspects were arrested and one man Aleksei Volnyanko, , confessed to the murder.It has been claimed by activists that Volnyanko was a “scapegoat” in the killing of Yelena who was a prominent critic of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, reports \" href\"https:www.rferl.org a after-the-slaying-of-a-russian-lgbt-activist-a-suspect-confesses----but-few-are-convinced .html\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Radio Free Europe.State media backed the police and promoted the theory that the activist - who opposed Moscows annexation of Ukraines Crimea peninsula - had an antisocial lestyle and a drink problem. When the so-called Saw site first appeared online in , homophobic attacks surged in the Russian region of Bashkortostan and in particular its capital Ufa.Activists were sent posters featuring the Jigsaw Killer along with the caption “ of the best homophobes from the Chechen Republic visiting the Bashkir capital.”Chechnya is a republic within the Russian Federation whose leader Ramzan Kadyrov is an outspoken bigot who has claimed there are no gay people in his country.Journalist Regina Khisamova, from the city of Kazan west of Ufa, said LGBT people were “tracked and beaten on the streets” during  and .She told Sun Online that police in the city did not protect the LGBT community, saying: “Victims rarely go to the police because they cannot find help there.“Statements of people who openly talk about their orientation aren’t considered by anyone.”This week, Regina interviewed Aidar Ismagilov, a gay activist from Kazan, who says he was targeted by the Saw group when he visited Ufa.He said: “A couple of years ago I went to work in Ufa for a month and met a guy online who claimed to be in the activist movement.“He invited me over for a visit. However, when I told another friend about the guy he said he was somehow connected with Saw.“I turned around almost at his front door - it saved me. This guy eventually wrote to me and threatened me.”Leading British LGBT activist \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Peter Tatchell slammed the Putin regime for not taking action against the twisted homophobes.He told Sun Online: These online vigilante threats and subsequent violent attacks are almost never prosecuted.

The National Audit Office said the wait time can exacerbate claimants debt and financial dficulties and hit those households already struggling to make ends meet.According to the report  per cent of low-income households have deductions from their benefits of up to  per cent when their first payment does come because of taking out debts to cover the wait time. This is compared to  per cent of all households. The Sun launched the Make Universal Credit Work campaign to slash wait times for first payments so people arent forced to sell their belongings or take out loans to survive - and to make it easier for people to get back to work.According to research by the Department for Work and Pensions rent arrears increase more rapidly after a claim for the benefit - sending households further into debt. Think-tank Resolution Foundation found many people struggling to get by during lockdown did not take advance payments while waiting for the first Universal Credit cheque over fears of being saddled with more debt.The wait time for the first payment often stretched far beyond the estimated five-week-wait time - at least six per cent of households in  - or , new claims - were forced to wait  weeks or more the full payment. Experts have warned the wait time can push people into severe hardship and even cause them to feel suicidal. But the NAO did find the DWP had signicantly improved the proportion of claims paid on time, from  per cent in January  to  per cent in February .One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes five weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story.In , , people still had their first payments made late - up from , in  - because of the overall number of claimants rising. The report did not cover the period during the coronavirus pandemic where the number of people claiming Universal Credit hit . million, according to the Office for National Statistics.But the number of people paid late rose from , in  to , in , due to the overall number of claimants rising.DWP chiefs were armed with an extra £million to use to double the number of work coaches to , over fears of mass unemployment because of the lockdown. Mum-of-three Demi Morris was left struggling to put food on the table after the five-week wait for cash pushed her into debt.Demi said: They give you an advanced loan which you have to pay back, but it only gets you even further in debt.I went out to work in care in the community for  hours a week, which they said would be fine, but it messed everything up.When shes not working she looks after her nephew, who as learning dficulties, Asperger syndrome and ADHD, and needs constant care and support.The family almost got evicted when they first moved onto the new system because the rent wasnt paid directly to their landlord and came through weeks late.Not only was I in debt with the £ advanced payment but it messed my rent up and reduced my payments to the point where I’m struggling to put food on the table, she said.I feel like we cant afford Christmas.Weve got just about enough for food on the table and a roof over our heads, which we just have to be thankful for.I can understand why people in this situation get depressed and take their own lives, I really can, because they do not explain any of this to you.All I want to know is how many hours I should work. Now they say I should be working more than  hours, but how can I when I’m looking after my nephew as well Iain Porter of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the five-week wait should have been ditched long before the coronavirus pandemic. He said: There was nothing compassionate or just about this policy prior to the pandemic.As the levels of unemployment grow, we urgently need to get support to people when they need it. In the last week, thousands of jobs have been lost as high street shops have announced cuts to stores. A DWP spokesman said: “Universal Credit is delivering in these unprecedented times, with more than . million new claims processed since mid-March and over one million advances paid to those in urgent need within days. Nobody has to wait five weeks for payment.“As the report shows, signicant improvement has been made in the proportion of Universal Credit claimants receiving their first payment on time and in full, currently around  per cent.“We’ve also increased the standard allowance by up to £, a year, as part of a package of welfare measures worth over £. billion to support the most vulnerable.”  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I still get a thrill when I find that the plane waiting at the airport gate has that distinctive roof bubble. It’s not my absolute favourite machine in the world but it’s certainly up there. Which is why I was sad to hear this week that, thanks to the ’s thirst for fuel, Boeing has pulled the plug.Back in the Sixties, everyone assumed the future of air travel would be glamorous and sexy and supersonic. That’s why Britain and France teamed up to make Concorde — which IS my absolute favourite machine in the world.But giant American airline Pan Am thought dferently. They wanted a plane which would carry lots of people cheaply, which meant it had to be big. So they went to Boeing and, in just  months — a staggering achievement — the  was born. It was not an easy birth. Pilots found in test flights that the wings would flutter.So, to solve the problem, engineers fitted ballast made from depleted uranium.There was also a problem with engines stalling for no obvious reason and an even bigger problem with the regulations, which said all passengers should be able to evacuate the cabin in less than  seconds.That’s just about possible when there are only  people on board but notthere are . Especially when  of them are up on the top deck.Still, they solved the issues at breakneck speed — by throwing people out and breaking their legs — and even though one of the first planes crashed into a post while landing and ripped off its undercarriage, the  went into production. And straight into another problem.A massive recession meant no airline was going to be daft enough to spend millions on one of the new behemoths, so in an -month period only two were sold. Both to Aer Lingus.Eventually, though, the  caught on and, soon, it became the only realistic way of giving yourself epic jet-lag.It was fast, too. Not as fast as Concorde, obviously. But when there’s a tail wind, pilots often have to ease back on the throttle of a  to stop it going through the sound barrier.And then there’s the safety record. Over the years a few have crashed but subsequent investigations have almost always found the plane wasn’t to blame. It was shot down, the pilot had been impatient or there had been a mistake with the servicing.Usually, though, the plane would survive. On flight UAL  from Los Angeles to Sydney in , the cargo door blew off, taking several square feet of fuselage with it.Nine passengers were sucked out and at least one went through the number three engine, which immediately broke.Shortly afterwards, flames began to appear from engine number four so the pilots, suffering from giddiness as the oxygen system had been knocked out by the explosive decompression, had to shut that down too. But despite all this, the plane landed safely and no further lives were lost.Over the years, the  has been militarised and turned into an airborne command-and-control centre for the US President. It’s been used as a fire engine, carrying , gallons of water to douse forest blazes. And it’s carried space shuttles on its back.But it’ll be remembered most of all for the joy it brought to the world, taking people to places they could never have visited before it came along. There’s no other plane like it. It even had a face like Thomas The Tank Engine. I shall miss it.GINA Prince-Blythewood, the female director of new action movie The Old Guard, says that “being able to throw a punch . . . is the biggest giveaway in an action film with women”.That’s presumably why she cast Charlize Theron in the lead role.Having seen Mad Max: Fury Road and, better still, Atomic Blonde, you get the sense thatyou bumped into the South African actress in a pub, you’d be very careful not to spill her pint.THERE have been queues round the block in London for a pair of limited-edition Air Jordan  OG Dior training shoes which cost, wait for it, £,.They are not made from gold or the foreskin of a rare whale. The laces are not studded with rubies and there is no platinum in the soles.They are just shoes.But somehow, it has been decided they should cost more than the very tidy  Mini Cooper I saw on Auto Trader this week.I NEEDED this week to set up an online presence for my new farm shop and, like every other old person, I called my daughter who popped round to help.In a blizzard of activity, she went online, bought something called a domain name, started a new email address, linked it to my phone, and then, by pressing and holding ious buttons, created an Instagram account. Throughout the whole process, she gave a running commentary, explaining what she was doing and why, and it was incredible.Because although I could tell she was speaking in English, I literally didn’t understand a single word she said.WHENEVER countries are asked to check their beaches for cleanliness, Britain always sends an army of boffins to the coast with test tubes and pipettes and some litmus paper.And having analysed the reports, we always say our beaches are filthy.Every other country, meanwhile, does no checking at all and says their beaches are fine.And I’m beginning to wonderthe same sort of thing is going on with the coronavirus figures. According to the latest numbers, there have been  Covid deaths in India for every one million people in the population. The number for Pakistan is , Turkey is , Egypt is  and Russia is . Whereas in Britain, it’s a whopping .This is seen as proof that we are the dirty man of the world, that we don’t wash our hands, that we cough all over one another and that our useless Government has done a terrible job.Or is it actually proof that we are the only country that’s counting properly TWO out of three people in Britain aged  to  think the Battle of Britain might be something to do with the English Civil War.So there’s a message for the BBC. If it’s serious about wooing younger audiences with something inspirational and educational, that shows -year-olds doing something truly heroic, how about clearing the schedules this weekend and showing the Battle Of Britain movie. I SEE it’s now possible to suffer from something called “unconscious racism”. This means you are being racist when you don’t think you’re being racist.So let’s just get this straight. I’m currently thinking about making a sandwich. I know there’s a bit of cold chicken in the fridge and I’m wondering whether to add some mayonnaise.This means I’m not thinking about robbing a bank.

For example, its role in the slave trade, Bloody Sunday, the jailing of the Guildford Four and the potato famine of the s. But when it came to saying sorry for his own actions, like taking us into an illegal war in Iraq which killed  British service people and hundreds of thousands of locals, he couldn’t do it. The best the trained lawyer could come up with was to express “sorrow” and “regret” for any mistakes he had made. Boris Johnson is similar to Blair in many ways. He lacks any defined ­political ideology and is a ham actor who believes charm is man’s most powerful character trait. And he too has said sorry when there was little political capital to lose.Chasing the BAME vote at the last ­election, he apologised for the “hurt and offence” caused by Islamophobia in the Tory Party. And after approving an article in the Spectator magazine he was editing in , which claimed drunken ­Liverpool fans caused the  deaths at ­Hillsborough, he was forced up to the city by his party leader to apologise. But, like the man himself, it was insipid, insincere, and accepted by no one. Only in , when the Hillsborough Report demolished the article’s unfounded claims, did he offer an unreserved apology. And only after David Cameron, whose job the then London mayor coveted, had grovelled to the Hillsborough families from the Commons floor. An apology issued by Cameron because the blame game was up. More than  years after the Establishment, led by Margaret Thatcher, had accused fans of killing their own to sht guilt from itself, the truth had been established. And they had no option but to abide by it. Watching Labour leader Keir Starmer fail to elicit an apology from Johnson for blaming care workers for the appalling Covid death toll in their residential homes, I was hit with a nauseous sense of deja vu. Once again the blame game was kicking in. Johnson’s accusation that “too many care homes didn’t really follow procedures” was so deliberate and specic it had to have been crafted by Downing Street lawyers. They know an independent inquiry into Britain’s appalling Covid- death toll will conclude that confused government guidance, lack of testing and PPE, plus sending untested hospital patients back into care homes, were the main reasons , residents, % of all Covid deaths, perished between March and early June.

Remdesivir has been at the forefront of the global battle against coronavirus after the intravenously administered medicine helped shorten hospital recovery times, according to data in April from a separate US government trial. That study showed a trend toward better survival for remdesivir but the dference was not statistically signicant. In the latest analysis, Gilead said it analyzed data from  patients treated in its late-stage study and a separate real-world retrospective cohort of  patients with similar characteristics and disease severity. Gilead#xs late-stage study evaluated the safety and efficacy of five-day and -day dosing durations of remdesivir in hospitalized patients. The study did not have a placebo comparison. Dr. Susan Olender from Columbia University Irving Medical Center said in the Gilead statement that the analysis draws from a real-world setting and serves as an important adjunct to clinical trial data even as it is not as vigorous as a randomized controlled trial. However, Dr. Walid Gellad, a professor at University of Pittsburgh#xs medical school, called it #xCa joke#xD to compare clinical trial data with observational data and conclude anything definitive about mortality.#xCThe mortality in the remdesivir trials has generally been lower for both control and intervention groups than other trials and other real world cohorts I#xve seen,#xD Gellad said in an email. #xCThe real world patients are taken care of at dferent hospitals than those in the trial and potentially dferent adjunct treatments.

While Kate is used to taking centre stage on royal engagements, she had to step aside on this one as the tennis mad youngsters couldnapost wait to grill the former Wimbledon champion on his career. In honour of the Wimbledon championships, which was scheduled to have its final this weekend, the duchess dropped in with a video call to pupils at Bond Primary School, quizzing them on their sports training before revealing she had her pal waiting on the line. Cheekily giving a handful of clues to leave children in no doubt as to who was coming, she told them: “Iaposve got a very important person here thataposs going to come and join us, that would love to meet you guys and might be able to share some tennis tips as well with you. Sir Andy, who would usually have been playing at Wimbledon this week, went on to answer questions from budding tennis players, disclosing he was missing big matches, friends and family, but passing the time with homeschooling and a new hobby of road cycling. Kate also turned interviewer during the chat, asking Sir Andy about his lockdown experience and whether he had kept up with training. He said he found the first five or six manageable, but then admitted he had “started to find it probably a bit harder to find things to do for the kids, to stay creative with ideas and games for them to enjoy. He said: “Weaposre doing the home schooling which is dficult. It was dficult but at times I really enjoyed it as well.” He revealed that he didnapost play tennis for about  weeks, taking up cycling instead to stay in shape. “I was going out on my road bike which was something I’ve never done before, so that’s something kind of new that I learned I enjoy during lockdown,” he said. “Itaposs quite important in these times to stay as active as you can because it good for the mind as well.”  Kate also askedhe missed big matches, to which he replied: “I think missing the big competitions, because Iaposm getting old for a tennis player - you never know how many opportunities youaposre going to have left to play the biggest competitions. “So missing Wimbledon this week is obviously a shame. “Iaposve missed the travelling...missing seeing friends like everyone . “Family, Iaposve not seen my mum and dad for a few months so iaposm looking forward to seeing them again hopefully very soon. “Thereaposs been some challenges but I guess sometimes when you go through dficult moments like this you learn to appreciate the things you maybe took for granted sometimes  “Iaposll definitely make sure I spend more time with my family and friends when I get the opportunity.” “Exactly,” the Duchess replied. “And hopefully that time is relatively near as well.” Kate made the aposroyal visitapos in her role as Patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Clubfrom her Anmer Hall home in Norfolk to students from Bond Primary School in Mitcham ahead of what would have been the final weekend of the world famous tournament. The Duchess previously visited the school in January  to see the work of the Wimbledon Junior Tennis Initiative, the AELTC’s community tennis programme, which sees coaches deliver free tennis sessions to school children in the boroughs of Merton and Wandsworth. Appearing at the end of the children’s tennis lesson with AELTC Head Coach Dan Bloxham, the Duchess asked them about their time in lockdown and whether they have missed their friends, hearing about their new school regime of social bubbles.  One instructor said the children had been on fire in training that day, with the Duchess asking What sort of things have you been learning  Shown one of the drills, which involved young players running quickly on the spot, she said: Fantastic! Thataposs very important for your footwork isnapost it  Asking the classthey have missed doing physical exercise during lockdown she said: “Itaposs really hard isnapost it, to keep that self-motivation going. Itaposs very impressive youaposve kept that training going. Hearing about the best bits of watching Wimbledon, she added: “They [players] show great sportsmanship as well. I think tennis is brilliant for that, especially Wimbledon.”  Revealing Sir Andy to the class she teased: “Now, because youaposre all such keen tennis fans, Iaposve got a very important person here thataposs going to come and join us, that would love to meet you guys and might be able to share some tennis tips as well with you. “Iaposll give you a few clues and seeyou can guess who this special guest might be. So he ... is a he. He plays tennis for Great Britain. HEaposs a two-time Olympic champion. Heaposs a former World Number One... Can you possibly guess who this might be ” One boy piped up “Andy Murray”, followed by a round of applause as the former Wimbledon champion appeared on the screen.  The youngsters and coaches asked the grand slam winning tennis star why he picked tennis as a career, whether he remembered his first tennis match and comebacks from dficult times.  Sir Andy told them of the importance of having good family and friends around him to help “moving forward and working hard through setbacks. “The most important thing is to have fun,” he said.  “If youaposre enjoying it, you get more out of your lessons and your practising. Listen to your coach, that’s very important. Thataposs the two most important things at your age. “If you’re competing or playing any matches, try really hard in them. “But winning and losing isnapost the most important thing. Enjoying playing a sport and being active is the most important thing. “If you do go on to choose it as your career obviously the winning and losing changes a bit.” Asking the children about their other favourite sports, the Duchess and Sir Andy laughed as they animatedly shared their favourite football teams of Cha and Tottenham.

Five apartments were knocked together to re-form the cottage, while beams, floors and the water and gas systems were replaced. When they quit being full-time royals earlier this year, Harry vowed to repay the cash. Now it is believed the couple have agreed a “rental-plus” deal, above market rate, to keep Frogmore as their official UK base. The Queen made it clear they can use it indefinitely. The couple initially moved to Canada, but now live in Los Angeles, along with baby Archie. They are said to be living in a £ million mansion owned by actor and director Tyler Perry. The actor and director is reported to have given the royal couple the run of the expansive Tuscan-style villa. It boasts eight-bedrooms and  bathrooms, and was custom-built by Perry after he bought the -acre site back in . They are staying there with their son Archie and have already beefed up security there by erecting ft high screens around the back of the property. The couple have shared a few glimpses inside their new home on video calls as theyaposve done virtual engagements with charities and organisations during the pandemic.

Fty organisations will get £, and  causes £, to help them adapt to a “new normal”. Entries are already pouring in from youth clubs, support groups, food and baby banks, local charities and many more. Here we turn the spotlight on just six of the worthy causes hoping to receive our help. Chat group here to help you relieve the suffering Mandy Burns has suffered with depression for most of her adult le. She is the secretary for Talk Tonight, a support group for anyone in need of mental health help. Mandy says: “Pre-Covid we would meet up on a Tuesday night and just chat. You could speak as much or as little as you wanted. “It took one lady months to tell her story and that was completely fine. Some people have been through tough times and it takes a good while to open up.” The group was set up last October in Selby, North Yorks, by Mandy’s colleague Paul and his we Aimee Rathbone. They have suffered with their mental health. Mandy adds: “More than  people turned up at that first group. Anybody can come along, evenyou’re just lonely. “It offers a routine and something to look forward to every week. The group went from strength to strength.” Talk Tonight is supporting members online until face-to-face meetings can resume. A grant would help to fund outdoor activity sessions for members. Tiny Hands Baby Bank Help for mums It’s been tough on mothers to find baby stuff A foster carer for eight years, Jane Robinson couldn’t find anywhere to donate baby items she no longer needed, giving her the idea for Tiny Hands. “My husband and I thoughtwe could get everything dropped at our house we could get it handed out in parcels for mums who were struggling,” she says. “The need was certainly there, we went from a little shed in my garden to a registered charity, almost overnight.” Tiny Hands has helped more than , families across Yorkshire in the past three years. Most referrals come from health professionals, including social workers and community midwives, who work with families in need of a cot, a pushchair or nappies and wipes to tide them over. Many mums are in horrendous situations, suffering from domestic violence or having been trafficked into the country. Referrals rose by % in lockdown but funding has been cut due to events being cancelled, leading to a lack of supplies. “Some have been unable to go out and get the stuff they need and we’ve had an awful lot of domestic violence referrals,” says Jane, of South Elmsall, West Yorks. Cherry Trees Respite care    Giving caring families time to recharge Cherry Trees provides a leline for more than  families a year who care for children with complex disabilities. The centre in Surrey offers short break respite care for up to  kids at a time, with families travelling from far and wide. Its head of fundraising Jane Hunnable, said: “We are supporting the child’s family, including siblings. They need time for rest and recuperation – in a lot of these families the parents will have   caring responsibilities and a little bit of respite goes a long way.” Children who stay have a whale of a time, with arts and crafts, sensory play, walks and trips to local attractions. “We pride ourselves on being a home from home,” said Jane. “We want every child who comes to us to have a great time, have fun and take steps like every other child does, to learn skills and grow and develop and flourish in le.” Cherry Trees, with a waiting list to attend, supported families during Covid. A grant would help to transform their garden which needs a complete overhaul. Jane added: “All children deserve the thrill of meaningful physical play and our new sensory garden space will create these experiences for them, regardless of their disability.” Hopefield Animal Sanctuary Winter will be a struggle this year From horses, cows, pigs, sheep and goats to rabbits and parrots, Hopefield cares for  animals in Brentwood, Essex. Some of the creatures are abused and neglected. Others, such as a pregnant donkey found tied to a lamppost in London, have been abandoned.  “Some people can no longer care for their pets because their circumstances change,” says the sanctuary’s general manager Lianne Angliss. “Others have bought an exotic pet and are completely out of their depths. The animals become malnourished or can’t be handled.” Covid- has had a devastating effect on Hopefield, which is usually open to visitors at this time of year. “Lockdown came in so we were unable to open at all in March,” says Lianne. “This year we’ve not been able to open at all and we’ve lost four months of fundraising. Winter will be a struggle this year.” Hopefield was put forward for a grant by Jenny Aldridge, who said: “I know the people who run it have been working day and night caring for the animals despite the current challenges.” Bede’s Helping Hands Food Bank    Tracy put her own cash in to feed the needy When the virus struck, Tracy Beaton had a way to go before her foodbank was ready.But with people more in need than ever she decided to open anyway, putting a lotof her own money into buying food.Donations began to come in from local businesses and supporters and Bede’s Helping Hands Food Bank in Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, was up and running.“I was in a fundraising group and noticed people struggling in our ward,” says Tracy. “The nearest foodbank was hard to get to. We get elderly folk, families who aren’t getting a wage, people who have just gone on Universal Credit and weren’t getting any money. If someone phones and they’re desperate, we will help.”Tracy calls elderly people in the morning from the foodbank’s HQ at the Bilton Hall Community Trust to askthey need a meal. “A lot of people I deal with are on their own. Some don’t want a meal but just a chat.“A grant would help us to continue. We are in desperate need of fresh fruit andveg to put in our packs – we don’t have the money to do this on a regular basis.”Alzheimer’s  Dementia Support Services    They’re a vital support network for many This charity in Northfleet, Kent, provides ious kinds of help for people living with the conditions and for their carers. It offers a -hour confidential dementia helpline, a day centre, a support at home service and a lot more besides. “They just do so much, including a special club for people under , a carers’ club and a buddies scheme,” says Jackie Thompson, who nominated the “vital support network”, which she used to volunteer at, for a grant. Some of the charity’s services went virtual during the pandemic and their minibus was used to reduce pressure on the NHS. But the specially adapted bus, used for discharging medically fit patients into the charity’s care at home service, was stolen and later found reduced to a burnt-out shell. Supporters soon began to donate cash for a new bus.

A poll of , UK adults saw the Welsh city of Cardf triumph, getting a higher rating than any other city in the country, scoring an average of . out of five. Newcastle, which has picturesque routes stretching all the way from Gateshead Millennium Bridge to a number of locations, came second with a rating of . on average - a score also matched by the seaside city of Plymouth. Birmingham and London completed the top five, followed by Leeds, Edinburgh, Bristol, Glasgow and Norwich. Participants were asked to rate a range of factors including cycling infrastructure, such as cycle lanes and signage, local cycling facilities, countryside accessibility and their sense of personal safety when it comes to cycling in the city. The research, commissioned by routing planning and navigation , Komoot, also found more than one in  Brits have bought a bicycle since lockdown measures were introduced in March. And more than a tenth of bicycle owners have even learnt to cycle during this time, while one in four have borrowed a friendaposs bike or rented one in order to enjoy a two-wheeled ride. It also emerged just under seven in  think they have seen far more bikes on the roads and cycle paths recently compared to before the pandemic. Komoot has created online cycle sport-specic guides for some of the best routes in the country. A spokesman for Komoot said: Cycling has seen a huge uplt over the past few months and in order for us to support this we need to understand what hurdles the UK public faces when it comes to cycling and what is important to them. We believe everyone should be able to access great cycling no matter where you live or how experienced you are as a cyclist. The study also found one in three respondents believe their self-confidence on two-wheels has rocketed as a result of using their bike more recently. However, four in  find it dficult to find routes or cycling paths near to them that are suitable for the bike they have. Other things that make a city great for people on two wheels include making it easy to get out of the urban jungle into the country. Flat cycle routes, without too many hills also featured on the list as well as wider paths and plenty of places to securely lock up your bike. The results showed the most popular type of bike in the UK is the classic mountain bike , followed by a road bike , while just  per cent own a aposhybridapos of the two. And just shy of one in  have invested in an electric bike, according to the OnePoll figures. It also emerged the average person will go for a bike ride five times a month, with the typical outing lasting just under an hour at  minutes. Some of the top reasons Brits love their bikes include being able to go much further than just on foot, finding it relaxing, and as itaposs a hobby the whole family can enjoy. More than half get on their bike to maintain their fitness levels more than anything , and  per cent enjoy getting some fresh air.

The bright schoolboy’s stabbing last March shocked the country. And as she saw the emotional toll of her brother’s death – and of the fight for justice after his killer was freed – on her shattered mum, Jade worried she might not make it through her self-isolation.Her fears tragically came true last month when Debbie Makki, , suddenly became ill and died, with suspected sepsis from an infection.Jade is convinced her mother would still be alive were it not for the weight of the grief and injustice, and believes she is the second victim of the violent act that claimed her younger brother. Jade says: “I did finally get to give her those hugs, on the hospital bed where she had died. “She was tested for corona and it came back negative, so they let us touch her. “I gave her a proper hug, the one I’d been wanting to give her for so long. “We were all still in shock, I couldn’t believe I’d lost her as well. “I think thatwe’d been able to give her those hugs while she was still alive, she’d still be with us today. “It was us, her children and grandchildren, who really kept her going through all this, just as she kept us going. “We couldn’t be there to comfort and reassure her during the stress and suffering she was going through.” When Debbie was laid to rest, even though Covid- rules meant only  people were able to attend her funeral, hundreds of neighbours lined the streets near her home in south Manchester, clapping as the hearse passed. Dozens of well-wishers stood at a safe distance outside the chapel at Southern Cemetery as Debbie was carried in, to the sound of Angel by Sarah McLachlan. Jade, , a former primary school teacher, says: “My mum had lived there for  years and the whole community really loved her. The support we’ve had since then has been amazing, with more people speaking out for Yousef.” Brilliantly clever Yousef, , had made his family proud by winning a bursary to attend prestigious £,-a-year Manchester Grammar School. But after leaving his home on a normal night out on March  last year, he was kned in the heart by his friend, former public schoolboy Joshua Molnar, .  The fatal fight was in upmarket Hale Barns, Gtr Manchester, home to Premier League footballers and TV stars. Molnar, , was cleared of murder and manslaughter, but jailed for  months for possessing a kne and perverting the course of justice after a trial in which he lied that someone  had stabbed Yousef, then claimed he acted in self-defence after he pulled a kne on him. Another boy, Adam Chowdhary, , one of Yousef’s closest pals, was sentenced to four months in a youth detention centre after admitting possession of the flick kne that killed Yousef. Jade says: “A piece of Mum died with Yousef that day. She was a strong person who made a tough stand for justice, but she never got over the emptiness of losing my brother.” Mum Debbie vowed to fight for a full inquest into Yousef’s death and pursue a civil case against Molnar, while launching a national campaign against kne crime that had her organising silent protests and in endless meetings with police, council officials and the CPS. In October she spoke at an anti-kne-crime summit in Manchester. But she was dealt another blow in February when Molnar was released early from prison, six days before the anniversary of Yousef’s death. Just weeks later, the country went into coronavirus lockdown and Debbie, who suffered from underlying health conditions, had to cut herself off from her family, except her son Mazen, , who lived with her.Jade, who is married to another Mazen, saw her mum only twice during ­lockdown, when she took her kids on their birthdays – on April  when Daniel turned two and May  when Zack was three. Jade says: “Before lockdown, we would see each other every day. “And we’d shower her with hugs and kisses, that was what kept her going despite all the sadness and stress that she’d had to deal with over the past year.“She suffered from inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis and had received a letter from the NHS telling her to stay at home.“She also had a weak heart which couldn’t take too much stress. When we did see her, we’d drive to her house and sit in the car while she got a chair and stayed in the garden, with the garden fence separating us. “We would chat but we couldn’t hug her, and that was really hard for her. “My kids found it dficult too, they used to call her Mum, not Nana, because she was like a second mum to them.

Mr Booker, , was at the public Lake Monroe park, near Bloomington, with white friends when a man wearing a cap emblazoned with the Confederate flag accused them of trespassing.

Over the years technology has changed dramatically - from using landlines, and large, chunky mobiles with the aerial sticking out of the top, to sleek, slim-line touchscreen phones. So unsurprisingly the universal gesture for speaking on the phone has changed too. Typically you stick out your pinky and thump whilst putting down the three middle fingers - but not anymore. Dad-of-two Daniel Alado from New York City, US, has discovered that his kids do it completely dferent, and itaposs blown everyone away. He shared the video to TikTok saying: s, s, s babies can relate. Daniel first approaches his we Marciella, and asks her what hand gesture she would use to show she was talking on the phone. Marciella instantly put her thumb up to her ear and her pinky to her mouth. Then he goes to his daughter Daniella, who puts her entire palm to her ear. And finally he walks to his son Kamilo in the dining room, who again, puts his flat hand to his face, and asks: Like this  Daniel says: All of us would go like this - gesturing the classic pinky and thumb gesture, and adds: But now the new generation goes like this and demonstrates the flat hand gesture that his kids used. Since posting the video it has received , likes and over , comments. A number of people were shocked to discover the change in gestures over the years, whilst many older users shared their own throwbacks and the younger generation struggled to relate. One said: OMG! I never thought of it that way lol. Another added: Iaposm born in  which is that awkward year where I do these old hand gestures but never actually use the object itself. Weaposre the middle child.

They were outside the doors of everyone in our block.#I must admit I thought it was a little weird, there was no note and then someone advised us it was five years out of date.#Andrew said they had Googled the Tele story from last year in which pasta enthusiast, Ian Bell, had been unmasked as the mystery benefactor.He revealed he stockpiles pasta in his house to then hand out to the less fortunate.Ian was approached for comment regarding the latest bulk delivery to the Broughty Ferry area but couldn#t be reached.Local Les Gordon, , said whoever had been behind the latest delivery must have been #very tired#.He added: #Everyone in our block also received it.

I think I’ve done enough to make people understand that I’ve a good idea of how management works.“I think the challenge is to come here and work in my home country and it lets me be near my family.“Coming to a great club like Dundee United lets me compete in the national league and that’s fantastic.“I’m excited about it and I’m looking forward to getting going but I’m calm about it. It’s not like I’m going to be losing my composure over it as I’m more experienced than that.“I’m looking forward to getting among the players and getting them ready for the Premiership.”Mellon was a beloved figure at Tranmere, having led the Merseyside club to great success.However, the -year-old insists it was a relatively easy decision to head up to Tayside and fulfil a childhood dream.“I grew up in Scotland and as a wee boy, obviously, watched Scottish football,” he explained.“It’s always been a dream of mine.“I love football so the romantic in me always wanted to either play here or, once I was too old for that,the opportunity ever came, to manage here with a fantastic football club that’s going to give me the opportunity to compete.“So it wasn’t too tough a decision. The opportunity came at the right time for me and I’m delighted to be here.”The timing was right for Mellon, but so was the set-up he will slot into at Tannadice, where he has been assured by owner Mark Ogren that he will be supported.Mellon continued: “With the size of the club, the people who are here and who I’ll be working with, obviously they are the champions of the Championship, the club is in a good place.“I’ve spoken to the owner and everything is lined up for me.“What can I achieve  That’s not really the way I work. It’s a day to day thing for me. I won’t lose my focus.“I just try to be the best I can every day and then pick up from the day before about how I’m going to keep improving the group and get them moving towards the way I want them to play in order to get victories.”He knows he’s at a club with huge potential.But Mellon insists United will be taking the path to success step by step under his leadership.Prior to his appointment on Monday, the talk under predecessor Robbie Neilson was for the club to be aiming for the top six on theirto the Premiership next season.However, for Mellon, it’s a case of slow and steady wins the race, starting with a bounce game against top-tier opposition on Saturday.“I aim to be good on Saturday. Honestly, I won’t lose my focus on that,” the -year-old former Fleetwood and Shrewsbury head coach said.“You will never get me talking on anything other than gradual improvement. I will get out and try to improve on yesterday.“That’s the only way to improve a human being, by first of all knowing what it takes to make them better and then recognising that.“That takes time, it takes relationships, that takes putting them into circumstances and moments in games and training. I will grow that and find out what that is.“That is how I will do this, step by step as we go on and I will try to keep improving day by day and game by game and enjoy le, not rushing too far ahead and predicting that I’m going to win the European Cup or anything.“I am very, very focused on making sure of that because that is the best way I know, in my experience, of building teams. I know that is the best way of doing it and that is what I will stay true to.”Meanwhile, No  Lee McCulloch is set to leave Dundee United to join former boss Robbie Neilson at Hearts.Fellow-assistant head coach Gordon Forrest is expected to remain for the time being but new Tangerines manager Micky Mellon is expected to bring in his own people.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

This applies to open air train stations, but not to bus stops.#There is no evidence to suggest there might be a benefit outdoors from wearing a face covering, unless in a crowded situation.#Physical distancing, hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene are the most important and effective things we can all do to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances. Every penny needed to keep these two lesavers in the air seven days a week,  days a year, is donated by the people of Scotland. We receive no statutory government funding.Yet, as I reflect on how the Scottish public has risen to every request we have made of them over the past seven years, I feel confident they will not abandon #The People#s Helicopter# at this particular time of need.Please support SCAAyou can and help us celebrate the seventh anniversary of this lesaving service # your service.John Bullough, Chairman, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance, Perth Airport.Sir,Volunteers are always important.

But this hasn#t stopped our volunteers from supporting young people. So many of our brilliant leaders are still running meetings online, helping Scouts catch up with their friends and continue to earn their awards.At a time when our children#s lives are so badly disrupted, these sessions are providing a sense of normality and continuity that#s so important for their well-being. We have also been supporting families across Scotland and beyond with free resources at scouts.org.uk the-great-indoors.I#d like to say a huge thank you to all our volunteers, whether you drive the minibus, make the drinks, look after the accounts or help deliver vital skills for le.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

The Argyll and Bute Climate Change group challenged me to make sure that I didn’t get into the habit of seeing this as a single issue but rather one that impacts absolutely everything I do at Westminster, from economic recovery planning, to defence and security, human rights and international affairs.#If there is a silver lining to this awful COVID- pandemic it is that going forward, we can do things dferently as iniduals, as a country, internationally and of course, globally.

Scotland is one of very few countries that have made a start on this, pioneering a government system which is based on a wellbeing economy. We need to accept that money is not the key to human happiness, and start putting our wellbeing before increasing our profit

will then challenge a further three players to collect litter, and in turn these three will nominate other team-mates, and so on.The project has the backing of Selkirk head coach Scott Wight.He said:

As ruins go, therersquos not a huge amount to explore no cramped spiral staircase to squeeze up, or dank cellars to investigate.But for me, such ruins have a dferent appeal. Not based so much on the physical exploration of what remains, but more an imaginative exploration of what we can no longer see.It has really ancient origins, dating back to the ninth century when the first Christian site seems to have been established here. That gives it over a thousand years of Christian connection, and I suspect it may have been a pre-Christian sacred site before that.The first kirk will have been wooden built, but the oldest surviving parts of the stone kirk we see today date from the late th century.On my most recent visit to the kirk, I stood in the nave and tried to imagine what Scotland was like in the s when parts of the walls around me were built. What a totally dferent world from ours, I thought, as I stood in the footsteps of those who stood on the same spot hundreds of years ago.On reflection, perhaps there were more similarities than we may imagine: pestilence, plague and epidemics, injustice and inequality, cruel rulers and pious preachers.There are some information boards with pictorial reconstructions that help us understand what we are looking at, but a ruin like this is the stuff of poetic imagination.Poets such as Shelley were inspired by ruins, and today they are popular visitor attractions all over the world.Compared to the scale of ruins such as the Acropolis or Pompeii, or even compared to nearby ruins such as Dirleton Castle, the old kirk of St Andrew may not impress. I donrsquot think it will ever be a popular tourist attraction.But thatrsquos why I enjoy visiting this place. Itrsquos a ruin with solitude, while ironically being very accessible and amidst a busy part of East Lothian.Over the years I have never personally met anyone  there visiting it. Many people know of it, of course, but because of its unassuming simplicity, I suspect few have got to know it.ldquoTherersquos not much to see, was an honest comment from a friend once. He was right on one level, but I think what we see depends how we look, and how we connect.For me anyway, the magic of this ruined kirk is not in what is visible but in the atmosphere of its story, and its unexpected tranquillity.Once, of course, it was very busy, for it was the place of worship for people from the edge of Aberlady Bay to the fringes of North Berwick, as well as from as far as four miles to the south. Every Sabbath there would have been processions of people from each direction, coming to meet and worship here together.Stand in the nave and you are at the centre of this ancient weekly migration. From here you will see a Norman arch, decorated with chevrons. Although the information board points out the craftsmanship is not of the finest quality, it makes me imagine some poorly paid, yet skilled, local stonemasons doing their best to beauty their kirk and it is certainly good enough.The arch was walled up many years ago, when the chancel became a burial place for the Yule family. So the decorated arch is now embedded in later stone, and looks like a fossil peeking out from a clf face.As I stood admiring it, I thought it had the atmosphere of a walled-up entrance into the past, in which figures from times gone by could emerge or perhaps I could walk through it to another age. Maybe Irsquove been watching too much Outlander .The kirk was used for worship for over  years, and even survived the Reformation. There is an amusing tale of the vicar from that time, which I shared in my first book. I thought of him as I stood in his church.It became a collegiate church in , so prayers were said here constantly by a group of priors to help the soul of the local laird to get into heaven. The prayers were paid for, of course, and one wondersthe laird got value for money.The kirk was finally abandoned around , apparently because of a petition from parishioners.One issue seems to have been the constant covering of sand blown over the kirk and kirkyard by endemic storms. What image does that conjure in our imagination  And what storms must they have been! But also, many people lived miles away from the kirk, as did the laird, and a new, more conveniently situated place of worship was wanted.I can understand this. Itrsquos a fair trek from, say, Dirleton to here, especially on an unpleasant, dark, cold winterrsquos morning. So a new replacement kirk was built at Dirleton, and St Andrewrsquos Kirk fell into disuse. Yet the kirkyard remained in use, and has many of its own tales to tell.I have never been a fan of crowded places, to be honest. Irsquove had my enjoyment of some favourite places ruined by being placed on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list.I doubt the ruins of the old kirk of St Andrew in Gullane will ever be on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list unless some celebrity gets married there, or itrsquos used as a movie location.It remains for me a wonderful place to visit, and I always spot small details that I missed on previous visits. My kids are fascinated by the stories told on the gravestones.As the lockdown eases, we are all understandably desperate to get out from our confinement and feel free once again to enjoy places. But then we often too readily build a new prison for ourselves by following the herd to overcrowded places where we are crammed into lsquomust-go-torsquo popular places.Maybe a gt from the lockdown is the discovery of those places nearby, less well known, but in their own way special and magical.For me, East Lothian is full of such small, less-well-known, special places, that will never be a on a lsquomust-seersquo list, but are all the more enjoyable for it.

This means that, under current rules, only members of the same household or extended household group are permitted to stay away from home together.The previous five mile travel distance limit for leisure has been lted, though the public are still being encouraged to stay within their local area where possible.Self-contained self-catering holiday accommodation across Scotland has also begun to reopen for bookings, including a iety of businesses such as caravan parks and camping sites.

The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next.

Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way.

It may be that the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has also become a devotee of this theory, which says governments can spend public money without having to worry about debt.He is in the hole for pound billion because of Covid and has seen the UK debt pile rise to nearly pound trillion. He borrowed a record poundbn in April alone. But he doesnrsquot sound all that worried and will be adding to it today in his summer statement.Modern monetarists believe that the traditional view of government finance ndash that it has to raise tax revenue to pay for services like the NHS ndash is wrong. Governments can spend on anything they want by printing money or borrowing. Just think of a number, print it and yoursquore off to the races.

Japan has public debt of % of GDP and seems to be surviving. An independent Scotland shouldnrsquot bother about debt either, so long as it has control of its currency, because it can just print Scottish pounds to pay for it.It sounds crazy, like Zimbabwean economics. And ultimately Modern Monetary Theory is a reductio ad absurdam. Fiat money has no intrinsic value soyou just increase the volume of it, without generating equivalent wealth, then its value will tend to reduce to nothing ndash as in Weimar Germany where people needed wheelbarr,ows to collect wages.However, there is method to MMT madness. It contains an important kernel of truth: that government spending, given low inflation, does not need to be financed by tax revenue.The traditional Thatcherite view, that you can only spend what you can afford, is back to front. If the state spends to get the economy moving in a recession the debt effectively finances itself by generating future taxation from the people newly employed.This was what John Maynard Keynes ndash really the grandfather of MMT ndash argued during the Great Depression. If governments spend money on, say, arms production the people employed in these factories go on to pay for goods and services from where in the private sector ndash food, clothing, housing and so on. This creates more private sector jobs through the so-called ldquomultiplier effect.Thus, a pound spent by the government generates more pounds in future by stimulating economic activity. So long as there is less than full employment governments should spend whatever it takes to get the economy running at full capacity. They could even pay people to dig holes and fill them in again.Yes, itrsquos a kind of free lunch argument and has been much criticised by conventional economists ndash including the European Central Bank - who believe excessive government spending debases the currency, distorts the market and leads to financial collapse, Greek style. Environmentalists donrsquot like the emphasis on growth.What has made Keynsianism, or MMT, so plausible recently is that many central banks have been printing money like therersquos no tomorrow since  and so far prices have remained stable and the roof has not fallen in. In the UK, the Bank of England has created an astonishing poundbn through Quantitative Easing ndash buying government debt.Conservatives like Boris Johnson, hardly radical leftists, are increasingly seeing debt as a good thing ndash or at any rate nothing to worry about. In order to keep his ldquored wall gains intact, Mr Johnson has promised to ldquobuild, build, build.Right now, interest rates are near zero, so there seems little reason to forgo spending. And thatrsquos precisely what Mr Sunak has been doing. In sheer volume terms he has spent more rapidly than any government in British history, mostly paying for furloughed employees.Paying private sector wages goes beyond what Modern Monetary Theorists advocate. It is more in the style of old-fashioned Marxists who wanted the state to take over the economy entirely. MMTers donrsquot want to nationalise the means of production.Of course, common sense says public spending canrsquot increase indefinitely. What about the interest on government debt  Surely that has to be paid. The UK currently spends poundbn a year on debt interest ndash more than on defence.Modern monetarists like Richard Murphy say the government should simply print more money to pay this, which it can do up to a point. However most government debt is owned by private pension funds and institutional investors or by foreign banks and financiers. In the long term,the government paid its debts in worthless printed pounds, theyrsquod soon stop lending.ldquoBut in the long run, said Keynes, ldquowersquore all dead. The Bank of England has printed hundreds of billions in QE since  and financiers are still falling over themselves to lend. Indeed, theyrsquore effectively lending at zero interest and getting nothing for their money.Mr Sunak will promise that Britainrsquos debts will be paid ndash he has to say that because free money sounds irresponsible. But he is likely to keep borrowing and spending because it is politically the sensible thing to do avert a Covid depression.People on the left are puzzled by this. Why is a Tory politician adopting the economics of Bernie Sanders  Well, it might be worth mentioning that one of the main founders of MMT was a hedge fund manager and tax exile, Warren Mosler, in the s. MMT is not a particularly left wing idea, nor is public debt.The former Republican Vice President, Dick Cheney, said in  that ldquodeficits donrsquot matter. Republican Presidents like Ronald Reagan and George Bush massively increased US public debt. It has been Democrats like Barak Obama and Bill Clinton who have sweated to reduce deficits.Donald Trump has ramped up more debt than any US government in history,  trillion, and is about to borrow trillion more.

Cut to four bizarre months later and today masks become mandatory in shops in Scotland, newspaper headlines scream out ldquoNot wearing a mask should be as taboo as drink-driving, say leading scientists, face coverings have become designer fashion accessories and the humble mask has somehow even managed to become one of the most isive political issues of our time. Wow.This week Nobel Prize-winning biologist Professor Sir Venki Ramakrishnan said that everyone should wear a face-covering inside public spaces, and pointed to lamentable figures which showed only % of British people wearing masks compared to % in Italy in April. ldquoIf all of us wear one he said ldquowe protect each other and thereby ourselves, reducing transmission.He argued that a stronger, clearer message from government was needed to persuade a ldquosceptical public about the benefits of face coverings. Asto prove his point, the very next day, launching his much-lauded meal voucher scheme, pin-up Chancellor Rishi Sunak beamed at me through the camera lens as he served two plates of steaming food to bewildered restaurant goers. He was all winning smiles and shiny hair but, notably, no mask.In fact, yoursquod be hard-pressed to think of any UK cabinet ministers on recent photo opportunities whorsquove sported a mask. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeonrsquos donning of a tartan face mask in June, as well as bringing ldquoa tsunami of sales for the company which made it, finally sent a bold, public health message from the top about the efficacy of masks.At the end of April the First Minister, in what was seen as the first ergence from UK Government policy, was advising us to wear them, just weeks after her own clinical director had said to BBC Radio Scotland: ldquoPeople donrsquot wear them properlyhelliptheyrsquore uncomfortable. Masks are not fun. Whilst the FM was dishing out the advice here, in London professor Angela MacLean from SAGE told us that the effect of face coverings against the virus was ldquosmall, whilst Matt Hancock insisted the Scottish Governmentrsquos advice was based on ldquoweak science.By May , the UK Government had changed its mind and was advising the public to cover their faces in enclosed public spaces, and on June  face coverings became mandatory on public transport but not shops. Scenes from English pubs were largely devoid of mask-wearers.What is it about a simple piece of cloth that is so dficult  OK, it does feel odd. When I wear my mask I feel self-conscious ndash instantly it feels like Irsquom the only one wearing one and everyonersquos staring. Being from an immigrant background, I spent every waking hour of my childhood and adolescent years trying to fit in with my peers, and now, I feel I am actively lsquootheringrsquo myself by practising something thatrsquos not culturally acceptable here yet, but has been in parts of Asia.It makes me feel panicky ndash my smile which lsquospeaksrsquo to people as I pass them, is hidden, so how will they know Irsquom friendly. And lastly, and this is a weird one, I feel a bit mysterious, almost alluring, as my eyes become hyper expressive, like some sort of bad Bollywood actress. Sadly, this new-found sexiness is tempered by the fact the mask makes my glasses steam up, so  times out of  the moment ends with me bumping into a shelf or tripping over a freshly-sanitised basket. Whilst all these are minor inconveniences, Irsquom more than happy to take my chances with them rather than be responsible for passing coronavirus to a friend or my elderly next door neighbour.What I donrsquot feel is that I donrsquot need it because Irsquom somehow immune as the virus hasnrsquot affected anyone I know, or that it is some sort of ploy by the nanny state to over-ride my civil liberties, as some people both here and in the United States believe.

No criteria for lting the move discussed.In order for the Scottish Government to enact subordinate legislation without laying a resolution before parliament, the Government must satisfy that the move is proportionate in response to a health emergency or urgent. This move, taking effect more than a week after first being announced and months after the infection peak is neither.Its a sorry day for this country when the opposition in parliament fails so abysmally in its duty. EvenJackson Carlaw, Richard Leonard or Willie Rennie truly believed this measure was \"proportionate\" or \"urgent\", they have a duty to scrutinise such a draconian, universal move that impinges on our civil liberties and sets a dangerous precedent. They failed.We have entered a new era of the pointlessness and ineffectiveness of this Scottish Parliament ndash when measures affecting every single inidual and forcing them to wear clothing against their will go entirely unchallenged, the population should worry about what  a power-hungry government has planned for us in the name of the Covid crisis.Jamie Black, Largs.AFTER travelling to Glasgow for the first time in four months, Id advise readers to put their le savings on a second Covid- sweep within the next two months. The sheer pedigree moronity of the general public makes it a literal dead cert.The train there and back were full of people of ious ages only bothering to put on masks when leaving the train only half wore masks in the city centre ndash which in the case of Argyle Street was chock-a-blockand the wearing of them in shops never applied to grunting, tattooed neanderthals under the impression that a threatening attitude to staff gave better Covid- protection than the idle handwash dispensers.All this before the shopping centres and pubs even reopen. I hope the Four Riders of the Bampocalyse havent booked their socially distanced summer holidays yet, because theyve some overtime coming.Mark Boyle, Johnstone.I AGREE with John Couttswhen he says: \"It was good that churches may now open for private prayer but any ongoing ban on collective worship clearly constitutes state interference in matters spiritual.\" He is also right in saying that the Government has a right to maintain public health by social distancing, but it has no further right to prohibit collective prayer and praise, provided social distancing is observed. I think that fear of the coronavirus has caused the Government to exercise control by the state over areas of inidual freedom of which the right to worship freely is one.Christians in Scotland paid a heavy price for freedom of worship. In covenanting times in the th century, men and women gave their lives in  years of persecution when James VI wished to impose on the Church of Scotland terms to which the church could not subscribe without forfeiting its spiritual independence.The Covenanters would not comply and worshipped in the hills and moors of the south and west of Scotland under the penalty of death.The Government has the power to demand political obedience but not spiritual obedience, and to deny inidual freedom in matters spiritual incurs the danger of totalitarianism where the state dictates what people can of cannot do as, for example, in North Korea and China. To prohibit singing in worship services is like Premier League football clubs playing with no fans, and with social distancing should be as safe as in any other property.Norman A Ogston, Johnstone.NICOLA Sturgeon is to allow churches to reopen with \"restrictions on singing\" despite Munichs famous Institute of Fluid Mechanics and Aerodynamics having found that droplets dont travel more than .m from singing test subjects.The fact is singing doesnt expel a large volume of air in jerks like coughing or sneezing. Perhaps Ms Sturgeon still believes the Kirks nonagenarian choristers eject droplets over vast distances and endanger low-flying aircraft.Once again she ignores real science and relies on policy wonks. French churches hauled Emmanuel Macron to the Supreme Court which told him to back off because interfering with religious services is illegal. We should have done the same.Rev Dr John Crawford, St Andrews.I APPRECIATE the sentiment of the SNP pleading for personal responsibility. However, the irony is that no government has done more to erode it than it has.Indeed,such an ethos of personal responsibility had worked we wouldnt have needed a ban on smoking in public places or the sugar tax, which I can almost guarantee will not be the end of the SNPrsquos erosion of personal liberty.In Scotland, you no longer even have the responsibility to prepare for the birth of your own baby any more. You canrsquot be trusted to eat correctly. You canrsquot be trusted to enjoy a can of fizzy juice. You canrsquot be trusted on the internet. Expensive Scottish Government propaganda informs us that \"We are Scotland\" or \"In Town, Slow Down\" or most insultingly, to \"play, talk, read\" to our own children.It would appear that the SNP trusts us to do absolutely nothing without being hectored, cajoled and controlled first.David Bone, Girvan.Read more: Letters: Chancellorrsquos latest intervention is akin to using a pea shooter against an elephant"},{"url":null,"title":"france-rebuild-notre-dame-former-likeness","story":"To stay historically accurate, it will again be built with potentially toxic lead.But Mr Macron came around to the traditionalistsrsquo argument and approved reconstruction plans for the th-century monument that were presented on Thursday, according to a statement from the state agency overseeing the project.The plan includes recreating the th-century spire by Viollet Le Duc that collapsed in the fire, and ldquofavours fidelity to the monumentrsquos form and restoration of the cathedral in its latest state, the statement said.That means the state Notre Dame was in the afternoon of April  , before a fire broke out beneath its roof, toppling its spire, consuming the roof and threatening the rose-windowed twin towers that keep the cathedral upright.More than a year later, the structure remains unstable.It took nearly a year to clear out dangerous lead residue released in the fire and to get to the point where workers could start removing scaffolding that had been in place before the fire for a previous renovation effort.Actual reconstruction will not start until next year.The reconstruction plan says it will replicate original materials ldquoto guarantee the authenticity, harmony and coherence of this masterpiece of Gothic art.Those materials originally include tons of lead, which is raising concerns among health and environmental groups.Toxic lead spewed by the fire forced schools in the area to close and prompted a y, painstaking cleanup effort of the historic neighbourhood on an island in the centre of Paris."},{"url":null,"title":"massage-school-criticises-government-opening-u-turn","story":"Sportand remedial therapists, who are trained to treat injuries, were advised by a professional association that they could begin treating clients for pain relief from Monday, July .The Scottish Massage Therapists Organisation , claimthey were told by two MPs that thegovernmentrsquosBusiness and Social Distancing Team had approved the move saying treatments could be classed as a lsquovocational medical service.

Safety measures to protect staff and customers are being put in place, with people asked to be sensible, continue to follow social distancing messages and stay close to home to support local business.To help people plan days out, the UK Government has launched the Know Before You Go website at visitbritain gb en know-before-you-goHere, we look at what action businesses have taken to ensure we can all enjoy summer safely.The UK Government is helping thousands of pubs, restaurants and hairdressers reopen safely with detailed practical information to help keep staff and customers safe. The new Covid- secure guidance for the hospitality sector and hairdressers meant businesses were able to reopen across England on July , provided they met key criteria. UK Government officials have worked alongside over  key industry stakeholders and trade unions to develop clear plans in line with scientic advice and public health directions, building on existing guidance published in May.The new guidance sets out a range of measures for pubs and restaurants to become Covid- secure, including:Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: “We know this pandemic has been particularly hard for people working in hairdressing and hospitality. Allowing pubs, restaurants and hairdressers to open will be another step in our plan to kickstart our economic recovery in a safe manner.”The guidance that is set out provides clear, practical steps businesses can take to open in a way that is as safe as possible for workers and customers.Separate guidance has been published for hairdressers, which states that a clear visor should be worn by the person providing the service, covering the face and providing a barrier between the wearer and the customer from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing or speaking.The government is also consulting with industry on how businesses should record customer information to help keep customers and employees safe and support the new test and trace system.Edinburgh Hair and beauty salon That Rosie Glow is preparing to open for business on July  after almost four months of closure due to the coronavirus lockdown. A number of safety measures will be in place to help prevent the spread of Covid- when the business opens. The salon has already installed clear screens between each treatment station, and at the reception desk.Customers and staff will be asked to wear face coverings, and customers will be requested to visit the salon alone where possible, and arrive on time rather than early to reduce time spent in the waiting area. They will have to keep their coats and belongings with them instead of them being hung up by staff, and there will be no magazines or refreshments available.Each station and any equipment used will be thoroughly cleaned between customers, and clean towels or gowns will be used with each one.Salon owner Rosie Fraser said: “We closed on March , but we have kept our social media active and positive, and kept in touch with clients.” Ms Fraser said she has tried to make the new measures as comfortable as possible, including the screens bearing the salon’s name. vw, px\"  She said: “I wanted to make sure the clients and also the staff felt safe coming back, and we also wanted people to feel like it’s a nice experience and not too clinical.“In this new normal we will be coming into we wanted to have safety but with style so that women still feel like they are having an enjoyable experience. Our whole ethos is to make women feel empowered, beautul, confident and glowing not only on the outside but on the inside too. With new measures making our usual level of service and attention to detail looking likely to change we did not want to have cheap looking, temporary fixtures.“We have had bespoke screens made with our logo engraved onto them and frames custom made and sprayed to be on brand.”When lockdown was announced, luxury knitwear company Corgi knew they had the experience to get through the Covid- crisis. The Welsh firm – which has a Royal Warrant from the Prince of Wales – has ridden many an economic downturn in its illustrious -year-old history. Co-owner Chris Jones, who is great-great grandson of the company’s founder, said: “We take a view that you can get through anything. I think it makes it easier because we’ve been through crises before.”It helped that the Ammanford-based firm had been through five fantastic years before coronavirus struck. In March they furloughed  of their  staff but now many are ing as orders begin to pick up.Corgi makes hand-finished wool, cotton and cashmere socks and other knitwear and Chris said: “Normally we run two shts on the sock machine, so we kept going with one. Next week going back to one and a half shts – we’re going to have the other knitters coming in some of the time.”With shops reopening, old customers are beginning to ask for new sales catalogues and Chris expects business to pick up properly in around a month.What has helped the business survive more than anything though was the package of financial help the Government made available. Chris said: “The furlough scheme has practically saved us.ithout it, we’d have been in a lot of trouble or we’d have managed but we’d have had to let a lot of people go.”But Claire, her staff and her customers are delighted that the Lisburn business is reopening after putting safety measures in place.Claire first opened the Barber’s Den four years ago and such was its popularity she also decided to expand to include The Hairdresser’s Den for all the ladies of Lisburn.When they had to put the business on hold due to the Covid- pandemic, it was an understandably worrying time for Claire and her staff.She said: “I am heavily pregnant. I’m  weeks now. When I found out the salon had to close the first thought was stress, panic, and what is going to happen to my clients. We closed early. We have about  to  clients a day so that is a lot of footfall and I had a real concern about safety.”Claire and her team have been busy getting the salon ready to welcome back her valued customers.With the rearrangement of the salon to allow social distancing, the introduction of PPE, risk assessment and team training, Claire is ready for the influx of people who are desperate for a haircut after the long months of lockdown.Claire said: “The guidelines are good. We have posters up with the guidelines on them and I have held a team meeting to carry out a risk assessment and explain to the staff what is expected of them.“Hand sanitisers have been installed and everywhere has been thoroughly cleaned.”The UK Government has published guidance to support businesses to reopen and keep workers and customers safe so they feel confident to .at gov.uk coronavirus-business-reopening.If you run a business and would like to know which of the coronavirus support schemes you are eligible for, you can use the business support finder tool.

It is hoped it will increase Kirkwall town centre footfall, while ensuring the safety of the public.Over  BIDs and councils across the UK are taking part in the MonsterHero Safari project, which has been sponsored by Wild in Art, with the aim of raising over £k for NHS Charities Together.Kelly Kirkness, Coordinator at Kirkwall BID said “I really love the Monster Hero Safari concept and I’m delighted we were chosen to participate. Our usual annual hunts are enjoyed by so many families and this contactless version is the perfect solution to keep everyone safe while still enjoying the town during the summer holidays.”Coordinating the national project is Martin Blackwell, former CEO of ATCM and the Charity Retail Association who said: “When I heard about the concept it just resonated with me and I knew I had to support it. I loved the idea of heroes the idea of a “safari on the high street”! I just thought,something fun like this can help make families feel good about going back out onto the high street and raise money for such a worthy cause then let’s go for it.”To learn more about the story-trail please go to: www.monsterherosafaricopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Everyone is in the same boat trying to step-up and deliver.“Before anyone had heard of Covid- we were already planning to equip GP practices for appointments and started that in October last year.”On March  national guidance was issued asking boards to accelerate the roll-out of the technology in an effort to curb the spread of the virus across the country.Kenny added: “Ultimately the increase in Near Me appointments has protected both our patients and staff from possible infection. We were looking to gradually introduce it but events over took that. We have trained more than  clinicians in range of specialisms since then.“There are benefits to Near Me over phone consultations and evidence shows visually you can pick-up signs and body language far more than on a phone call. So where it is clinically appropriate to do so we are having as many of these using Near Me as possible.“The initial focus was on enabling GP Practices, attention was shted to Mental Health Services, AHP and other clinical services traditionally delivered from the Balfour as the pandemic response developed. Working closely with service leads, training was delivered, equipment put in place and appointment processes modied to mirror the GP roll-out.“Uptake from both patients and clinicians has been very encouraging. Our Mental Health service has been able to meet the demands within the community at a time of increased anxiety and isolation.”He added that the uptake across the entire Mental Health Team led to them being asked to contribute to a national learning event to share their experiences.“Our maternity service is also doing very well and, despite only recently taking up the use of the technology, was similarly invited to contribute to a future national learning event due to its success,” Kenny said.“GP Simon Kemp from Daisy Villa has been selected, as one of only six practices in Scotland, to be part of a joint project with NHS Scotland and the Royal College of General Practitioners to develop guidance and help embed virtual appointment within GP practices across Scotland.“Near Me isn#t just about a response to Covid- – it was around before the pandemic. The trick for us is going to be to embed it and it can be the new normal in the future as we continue to protect our community.“For Orkney it has many benefits including providing care closer to home and reducing spend in relation to off island patient travel.“Going forward we will be targeting specialities where we have high numbers of patients travelling – sometimes on a three day round trip. We will work closely with our partner boards to ensure that the recent momentum continues and that the virtual clinic option becomes #business as usual#, where it is clinically appropriate to do so.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After monitoring for some time to assess the condition of the animal, and to ascertain whether it was entangled or not, medics were happy that the animal was free-swimming and not caught on anything, however it is in poor condition, for which the prognosis is not good. Unfortunately, as the tide as dropped the animal stranded in shallow water. Medics say that they have remained on scene throughout the day, to monitor its breathing rate from the safety of the shore, and to ensure it is not disturbed “whilst nature takes its course.”They added that unfortunately, with a whale of this size, humane euthanasia to prevent further suffering is not an option, and with it being in very poor health and malnourished it would be highly unlikely to survive at sea. Whilst this whale is not fully grown, it is likely to weigh in excess of  tonnes, which means whilst it is stranded out of the water it is crushing itself under its own bodyweight which will cause internal damage too. Unfortunately refloating a whale of this size once it has stranded is also impossible due to its size and weight. Adult fin whales can reach in excess of  metres inand weigh up to  tonnes.The medics added: “Whilst medics are on the scene monitoring the whale, the landowner has requested that no one  attends and we would ask that everyone please respects his wishes. The local Coastguard team have also been in attendance too.”An update will follow.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

samhlachadh, ach aithne gu bheil tomhas mhath dhe ar neart fhathast freumhaichte anns an dùthaich sin.Carson nach togamaid air an neart sin, fhad’s a tha e fhathast againn Chan eil sin a’ ciallachadh a bharrachd gum bu chòir dìochuimhnicheadh mu àiteachan eile.Tha mo chousins ann an Glaschu, agus mo nighean ann an Inbhirnis, agus mo charaidean agus mo theaghlach-cèile ann an Dùn Èideann a cheart cho airidh air taic agus air misneachadh agus a tha mo cho-oghaichean ann an Uibhist agus mo charaidean am Barraigh no an Leòdhas.Aidichidh mi, ceart gu leòr, uaireannan gu bheil thu nas fheàrr clìoras ‘coimhearsnachd Gàidhlig’ sam bith.Nach iomadh Gàidheal a fhuair saorsa nuair thog iad orra dhan bhaile mhòr  Agus tha mi eòlach gu leòr air am bristeadh-cridhe bhith measg dhaoine nach bruidhinn Gàidhlig riutged a tha làn an claiginn aca.Uaireannan tha e math a bhith leat fhèin, ged nach èisteadh riut ach na faoileagan aig cidhe a’ Chaoil!Ach mura neartaich sinn agus mura daingnich sinn agus mura leudaich sinn na freumhan anns na h-eileanan, cha bhi coimhearsnachd follaiseach làitheil againn, agus caillidh sinn bun-stèidh a dh’fhaodadh a bhith air leth prìseil airson fallaineachd cànain a neartachadh fad is farsaing.Ged a tha crìonadh air tachairt gun teagamh, tha lios canain nan eilean fhathast againn, agus bhiodh e an dà chuid amaideach agus na chùis-nàire gun obrachadh as ùr gu dùrachdach anns an lios sin airson math na dùthcha gu lèir. Tha mi gu math mothachail cuideachd gur e an òigridh, ge brìth ann an Dùn Èideann no ann an Dalabrog, a dh’fheumas an saoghal ùr seo a chruthachadh. Bha mi fhìn òg aig aon àm , agus sgìth gu leòr de dhaoine sean ag innse dhomh gum bu chòir dhomh siud a smaoineachadh agus seo a dhèanamh.Tha grunn dheugairean Gàidhlig anns an taigh agam fhìn agus tha mi gu math mothachail gu bheil na meadhanan ùra mar TikTok agus Snapchat agus Instagram nas freagarraiche dhaibh-san na bhith nan seasamh a’ bruidhinn mu sheann sgeulachdan aig ceann na fainge no aig cunntair a’ bhàr .Bidh an rud a tha didseatach an-diugh dùthchasach a-màireach.Ach math agus gu bheil conaltraidhean air-loidhne , aon uair agus gun crìon cànan làitheil anns a’ choimhearsnachd a tha timcheall ort, tha an t-uamhas air chall.Chan e mhàin blas, ach an rud prìseil sin – na dòighean a bhios daoine cleachdadh son iad fhèin a chuir an cèill gu nàdarra.Na h‑abairtean agus na nòsan a thogas tu, cha mhòr gun fhiosd, nuair a tha daoine a’ bruidhinn cànan sam bithmud thimcheall.Math agus gu bheil e Beurla no Fraingis no Gearmailtis, no ge brith dè ionnsachadh san sgoil, no air cùrsa, no air-loidhne, chan ionnan sin agus an togail ann an Dorset no anns an Dordogne no ann an Dusseldorf.Tha am beartas-cainnt sincho prìseil sa ghabhas, agus sin cho follaiseach do neach sam bith a leughas litreachas.Cainnt ionadal sgìre Dhorset a’ lasadh suas na leabhraichean aig Tòmas Hardy dual-chainnt Niseach a’ lasadh suas na sgrìobhaidhean iongantach aig Tormod Caimbeul cainnt na Maoirne a’ lasadh suas na nobhailean àlainn aig Grassic Gibbon..Tha cànan mar an cruinne-cè: chan eil toiseach no deireadh air ionnsachadh bhuaipe.Gu mì-fhortanach, is e am fiosrachadh a th’ agam gu bheil na Gàidheil air a bheil mi eòlach anns na h-Eileanan Siar, sean is òg, a’ faireachdainn gu bheil na “leasachaidhean” ann an saoghal na Gàidhlig anns na deich bliadhna fichead a dh’fhalbh air a dhol seachad orra-san.Nach buin an saoghal sin dhaibh – saoghal nam plànaichean agus nan ro-innleachdan agus nan aithisgean agus nan sgrùdaidhean agus nan rannsachaidhean agus nam molaidhean agus nan coinneamhan.Gu bheil e coimheach agus Gallda dhaibh – rud ris nach robh iad cleachdte, ged a tha adhbharan mòra eachdraidheil airson sin, le ginealach às dèidh ginealach gun chumhachd agus gun ghuth, ach fo smachd nan uachdarain agus na bàillidhean agus luchd na Beurla.Dè an teansa bh’ agad do thaobh-sa dhen argumaid a chuir, nuair bha a’ chànan anns am b’fheàrr a dh’innseadh tu e air fhaicinn mar rud salach, suarach Bha mi riamh dhen bharail gun robh dòighean eile ann daoine cumanta thoirt air bòrd: coinneachadh riutha aig ceann a’ gheata, no aig ceann an taighe.Bruidhinn riuthanan cànan fhèin.A’ bhith a’ gabhail bhòt airson àiteachan air bùird‑stiùiridh nam buidhnean leasachaidh, leithid MG Alba agus Bòrd na Gàidhlig, seach a bhith air an taghadh le seirbhisich-sìobhalta agus luchd-poileataigs ann an Dùn Èideann.Seòrsa de Magic Roundabout a th’ ann an-dr àsta.Zebedee an siud agus Florence an seo. Bha mi riamh dèidheil air Zebedee.An t-àm a dhol a chadal, chanadh e.Ach cha thachair an cruth-atharrachadh a tha a dhìth oirnn mura bheil “an luchd-leasachaidh” a-muigh anns na coimhearsnachdan fhèin, air an giùlain agus air am misneachadh le sluagh na sgìre.Tha fhios againn uile gu bheil dleasdanas laghail agus moralta air an Riaghaltas againn taic a thoirt dhan Ghàidhlig, ach tha fhios againn uile cuideachd gun dèan Riaghaltas sam bith na dh’fheumas iadseach na dh’fhaodadh iad.Sin carson a tha an deasbad a tha dol an-dràsta cudromach, oir ged a dh’iarramaid a h-uile rud, tha eachdraidh ag innse dhuinn nach fhaigh sinn e.Gheibh sinn siud, ma nì sinn strì agus argumaid air a shon, agus chan fhaigh sinn seo, mura dèan sinn spairn agus iomairt. Sin carson a tha e cudromach cò bhruidhneas air ar son agus as ar leth. Ceist bhunaiteach dheamocrataigeach a tha sin. Tha i doirbh, oir gu ìre mhòr tha leasachadh na Gàidhlig a’ crochadh air airgead poblach. Tha agus rathaidean, ach tha sinn fhathast an dùil gun cùm airgead poblach iad ann an deagh rian. ’ b’e an Riaghaltas agus a’ Chomhairle a bu chòir a bhith air sin a thogail. An aon rud a thaobh togail rathad rèidh na Gàidhlig! Faodaidh sinn uile ar dìcheall a dhèanamh le spaid is bara, ach is e digearan is rolairean mòra laghail an Riaghaltais a tha dhìth airson rathad susbainteach.Chan e gleanns gun shusbainta gheibh an rathad sin dhuinn.Ach aon uair is gu bheil an Riaghaltas an sàs, cleas maighstir sam bith, bidh iad – gun teagamh – an dùil gun dèan am buidheann a tha iad a’ pàigheadh an toil-san. Tha fhios gur e sin pàirt dhen duilgheadas a tha, agus a bhios, daonnan mu choinneamh cuango mar am Bòrd Cò a tha am Bòrd no MG Alba, mar eisimpleir, a’ riochdachadh: Riaghaltas na h-Alba an Dùn Èideann no na coimhearsnachdan Gàidhlig  Esan a phàigheas am pìobaire# Ged a tha mi airson seo a dhèanamh gu math soilleir: gu bheil mi cho moiteil sa ghabhas às gach neach a tha ag obair anns gach buidheann Gàidhliga tha dealasach is dìcheallach a thaobh na cànain agus dhan chultar agus a tha air an t-uàmhas a dhèanamh dhuinn.Gus an tèid urrasan ionadail, mar a tha Soillse a’ moladh, a stèidheachadh anns na coimhearsnachdan, ge-tà, saoilidh mi nach tig an t-adhartas a tha sinn uile a’ miannachadh.  a bhios aca  Ma bhios na h-urrasan air an taghadh gu poblach, cò gheibh bhòt: dìreach daoine aig a bheil Gàidhlig  Dìreach daoine a tha cleachdadh na Gàidhlig gach latha  Cò tha dol a thomhas sin   didsiteach ann gar clàradh, mar ann an saoghal Sheòrais Orwell Am bi bhòt aig a h-uile neach san sgìre, mar a bu chòir, fiù ’s nuair a tha % no % no % dhiubh gun Ghàidhlig agus coma mu deidhinn, no na h-aghaidh An e baile no sgìre no eilean  Mar a thuirt am fear-sgrùdaidh eile, cò tha dol a’ sgrùdadh nan sgrùdairean  No cò tha dol a sgrùdadh nan sgrùdairean a bhios a’ sgrùdadh nan sgrùdairean  Bha an dearbh dheasbad sin gu math fuilteach aig aon àm eadar Lenin agus Rosa Luxemburg anns an Ruis ag àm an Aramach ann an . ’son an rebholution a’ stiùireadh agus a thoirt air adhart.Chaidh ise a mhurt agus ghlèidh esan an latha, agus bha a’ bhlath air a bhuil.Ach mura creid sinn ann an deamocrasaidh ionadail agus anns na daoine fhèin, chan eil dòchas idir ann. An dèan Riaghaltas na h-Alba strì an aghaidh seo, is iad cho dèidheil air cumhachd a thàladh a-steach dhan mheadhan co-dhiù, mar a tha gach poileasaidh aca thairis na  bliadhna mu dheireadha’ dearbhadh Tha ceistean nas fharsainge ann cuideachd: ceistean a tha mi air togail gach dàrnacha seachdain anns a’ cholbh seo. Tha iad sin ceangailte ri fallaineachd eaconomaigeach nan sgìrean. Mura bheil obraichean ann an Uibhist no anns na Hearadh no ann an Leòdhas no eile, ciamar idir a tha thu dol a chumail òigridh  Agus ma tha obraichean annciamar a nì sinn cinnteach gur e Gàidheila gheibh na h-obraichean sin Oir tha gu leòr de dh’obraichean air a bhith air an cruthachadh as ùr ann an iomadh sgìre thairis na fichead bliadhna chaidh seachad, agus gu tric is e an rud a thachras gun tig Gall air choireigin a-steach a dheànamh na h-obrach sin .Chan eil lagh, moralta no eile, an aghaidh a leithid: cha bhuin an saoghal do dhuine againn. Chan eil e furasta, gun ghuth a ràdh air ceist thaigheadas, far nach fhaigh Gàidheil òga fearann no taigh anns am fuirich iad, eadar prìsean àrd agus margaid mhòr Airbnb.Is dòcha gu bheil cothrom aig A’ Ghàidhealtachd agus aig Na h-Eileanan air toiseach‑tòisichidh ùr a dheanamh a thaobh nan gnothaichean sin ri linn a’ Choròna‑Bhìorais. Nuair a dh’fhalbhas etha fhios nach till sinn gu mar a bha sinn – Gàidhealtachd a’ crochadh air aona-ghnìomhachas – turasachd.  chalpachais o aon cheann den chruinne-cè chun cheann eile.Tha fhios gu bheil cothrom an seo cur romhainn dè da-rìreabh a bhios riatanach dhan Ghàidhealtachd. Cosnaidhean uaine maireannach seasmhach. Ath-sgaoileadh dhen fhearann. Agus cho riatanach agus a tha e ar cànan a chur aig teas-mheadhan gach gnothach sin. Tha an dol a mach aig an “t-Sianal Gàidhlig” fhèinle còrr is % Beurla air na prògraman acana fhianais gum faod thu ainm no bratach Gàidhlig a thoirt air rud sam bith, ach fhathast gur e rud Gallda th’ ann. Bha mi a’ coimhead as ùr air na molaidhean riatanach agus dòchasach air làrach-lìn gaidhlig.tv an la roimhe: ’s truagh nach eil MG Alba, le sporan de £ millean, ag èisteachd riutha.Gu mi-fhortanach, chan eil mòran dòchas agam gun tachair adhartas mòr sam bith. The sinn mar sgeir bheag ann an cuan mòr na Beurla. Dè an t-ainm a th’ort  Is mise Ròn. Tha eagal orm gum falbh an Covid agus tillidh na motor-homes agus Airbnb agus thig an sgìre air ais gu default.   Seagh. Oir chan urrainn dhuinn cor na Gàidhlig gu lèir fhàgail aig lagh no aig Achd no aig bòrd no aig buidheann no aig aithisg no aig rannsachadh eile. Tha am Bòrd air a ràdh gu bheil an siostam a th’ ann ag obrachadh. Bu chòir dhuinn a bhith draghail gu bheil iad air sin a ràdh gu poblach. Tha mi faicinn gu bheil am Ball-Pàrlamaid Tòraidheach Dòmhnall Camshron a-nise ag iarraidh ‘Summit’air a’ Ghàidhealtachd, agus mo bheannachd air airson sin a ghairm. Is math bruidhinn, agus chì sinn dè a thig às an sin, a bharrachd air a bhith ag ithe tuilleadh bhriosgaidean.A dh’aindeoin cho duilich agus a tha an suidheachadh againn uiletha fhathast taghadh againn gach latha dè ni sin agus ciamar a nì sinn e. Am bruidhinn mi Gàidhlig leis a’ phàiste seo  An can mi facal Gàidhlig leis a’ chaillich seo ged a tha làn fhios agam nach eil facal Gàidhlig aice  Ach tha coltas blàth oirre. Feuchaidh mi. Halò.

An sgrìobh mi an dàn seo, no an colbh seo, no an aithisg seo, no an leabhar seo, no an rannsachadh seo, ann an Gàidhligno ann am Beurla  Tha iomadh dòigh ann gus cànain eadar ginealaicha bhrosnachadh, eadar cèilidhean is còmhraidhean, bho litreachas gu làthaireachd.

We must work to ensure that the SNP Comhairle Group becomes the majority and that the uncaring, out-of-touch councillors become the minority.On Friday, th June more than  pipers across the world played the haunting march The Heroes of St Valéry from doorsteps, gardens and streets.This recognised the service of the Second World War “Forgotten” st Highland Division which remained on the continent to fight the Nazis after the evacuations from Dunkirk. Despite their incredible bravery, around , men were finally encircled and captured at the Normandy fishing port of St Valéry-en-Caux on th June .The aim of our th commemoration was to ensure these men were remembered. St Valéry impacted on every town, village and hamlet across the Highlands and beyond. Eighty years on, those same communities were joined by pipers from across the globe as they paid their respects.As well as becoming the largest piping ensemble in history, a day-long programme of virtual events, learning resources fo young people and social media tribute messages achieved a reach of  million people.The event was supported three Armed Forces community charities: Poppyscotland, Legion Scotland and RCET: Scotland’s Armed Forces Children’s Charity. Each do vital work today.To each and every piper, we say: “Thank you!” And to those that support the work of those charities: “Many, many thanks!” Most of all, to the men of the st, our thanks, gratitude and respect.Once again this blustering PM talks in sound bites, as in #work work work, jobs jobs jobs and build build build#, all devoid of details.And from Get Brexit done to get Covid done, this is definitely the hand of Dominic Cummings.Boris Johnson#s ludicrous statement that there was #no such thing as a border between England and Scotland# and that all #regions# of the UK are moving forward together, only proves that in his desire to sound Churchillian he actually sounds more Trumpian!Again the factual, historic and dferent legal jurisdictions within the political framework of the Union are completely lost on Boris and London.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

If an item has been secured in this manner, do not attempt to remove the temporary barriers or use the equipment.Social DistancingWhen visiting a play park make sure you follow current government guidance on social distancing, encourage and support your children to do the same and keep a safe distance from others not in your household social bubble.Busy Play ParksPlay parks may be busier than usual. If the park you visit is busy, consider coming back at a later time and let your child know in advance that this may be a possibility to avoid disappointment.Hand WashingWash your hands and your children’s hands before and after visiting the play park. Take hand sanitiser with you and ensure you and your child use it frequently whilst in the play park.Waste ManagementMake sure any disposable tissues, PPE equipment etc. are disposed of in the bins provided orone is not available take it home for disposal.Be SensibleIf you or anyone in your household are showing any Coronavirus symptoms, stay home and do not visit the play park.PlayBoard is inviting children aged between  and  to share their views about how Covid- has impacted on their play by taking part in a survey at https:www.surveymonkey r PBYourVoice "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Although somewhat daunted by the responsibility which comes with the role of Chair I am nonetheless excited by the prospect for the year ahead. “The ongoing global pandemic undoubtedly brings enormous challenges for our organisation but by embracing the opportunities which technology offers there are ways in which we can keep the spirit of Inner Wheel alive. “I am immensely encouraged by the way in which our members have already adapted to the new normality. The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months.

He was speaking during a visit to a newly established Contact Tracing Centre in Ballymena.The new centre, which opened at the start of the month, is an important part of the wider Test, Trace, Protect programme managed by the Public Health Agency. Speaking during the visit the Health Minister said: “Test, Trace and Protect has a vital role to play in helping us move forward into recovery. This, along with other key public health measures, such as social distancing and ensuring good hand and respiratory hygiene, will help us to reduce community transmission of Covid-.“For Test, Trace and Protect to work, everyone in Northern Ireland must prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and be tested to help protect ourselves, our families and our communities.”The Minister added: “This is likely to become part of everyday le for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccine for Covid- is developed and a vaccination programme delivered.”Olive MacLeod, Interim Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, said: “The initial pilot phase of Covid- contact tracing began in Northern Ireland on  April and as of  May we have been tracing all positive cases. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to have this service established and operational. “Our contact tracing team is made up of trained staff who contact the person who has tested positive identy those people with whom they have had close contact and could be at risk of developing Covid- and in turn contact them to advise them on the appropriate next steps.”Mrs MacLeod concluded: “By this stage most people will be aware of Covid- symptoms which are a high temperature a new, continuous cough or a new loss of or change in sense of smell or taste. But people should also be aware thatthey develop any of these symptoms they should get tested for Covid-. More information on testing is available on the PHA website.” "},{"url":null,"title":"marketing drives north and south to win the attention of staycationers","story":"descriptionpinPlease confirm to access your content OK\",template_summary: Order summaryNeed help  Contact Customer CareAccountBillingConfirmation.epplans:not .epplans-more .eporder-box .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-select .field .StripeElement .field .StripeElement--focus #fp-payment-form .button selected_price\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"View other plansother_pricescoupon_codeSelect payment methodNew Cardother_payment_optionsPayment detailsCard NumberExpiration DateCVVComplete paymentLockSecure transaction\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"ArrowleftSelect a dferent payment method,template_summary_coupon_code: \"Coupon Codecoupon_validationRedeem Code\",template_summary_coupon_code_applied: \"Coupon Code Applied\",template_premium_fadeout: \"\",template_redeem_coupon_code: Redeem your SubscriptionEnter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

It also means a level playing field for tourism businesses here competing with the South where tourism VAT sits at .%.Howard Hastings, managing director of Hastings Hotels, described the move as the perfect post-lockdown boost to the staycation industry.He said the reduction combined with plans to give people a % discount to eat out in August, could not have come at a better time for an industry that needed an injection of confidence.But now in a very much expected turn of events, a new challenge has been forced upon those operating in the trade here - competition for our smaller, more local market - a market that is also being targeted by those in the South.It is a competition that Tourism NI anticipated and one it is confident it can succeed at.We will be investing in attracting that market because the Republic is a very strong competitor, with perhaps five or six times the resources we have. We need to make sure to share our voice. They will be upping their investment and they too will be dependent on a domestic market so we will have to be competitive, said Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen.On June  Tourism NI launched its Recovery Marketing Campaign, a mix of televised, digital and print advertising. It will run for  weeks in the North and South.But the fight will not be easy as rivals Failte Ireland continue with their own drive to encourage NI travellers into the South.In February, it launched a €mdomestic and Northern Ireland marketing campaign entitled #Keep Discovering#.While it did not comment on whether it would ramp up this activity further, it has said the campaign is one of the largest and most intensive marketing campaigns it has ever launched. The drive aims to deliver a financial boost of €mto the Irish economy over the next three years.Chief executive of Failte Ireland Paul Kelly said: Failte Ireland research tells us that half of all visitors coming from Northern Ireland stay along the border counties. By directing a signicant part of the #Keep Discovering# investment at growing our share of visitors from Northern Ireland we can bolster tourism in the border counties, which will be critical as the challenges posed by Brexit unfolds.Mr McGrillen said that Northern Ireland#s own campaign will celebrate the experience offered here. He added: The Recovery Campaign takes account of the fact that it will take time for our tourism sector to fully reopen. Our consumer research has also informed the tactics we will use and when we will use them, to create the best prospects for immediate bookings.He said that now is the time to target the southern market. Our visitor numbers from Ireland had not been as high as they should be, they#d grown over the last three years because of the devaluation of sterling, which made us more competitive, but there is still some growth in that area and we will attract that through the delivery of new campaigns.In Ireland our marketing campaign will be about saying hello to more and creating awareness of the value for money opportunities here. There#s a challenge with Ireland in selling what we have and that#s the perception of distance. We need to work on that because the reality is Belfast is closer to Dublin than Cork or Kerry so another theme will be how a small step can lead to a great adventure.Mr Hastings said his group of hotels will fully participate in the Eat Out to Help Out scheme by offering % reductions in meal prices during the week in August.He said the latter, alongside new, lower accommodation rates will be welcome news to people looking to book staycations who may not have considered the North previously.The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation chief executive Janice Gault agrees the VAT cut now enables Northern Ireland to compete on an all-island basis.She said: This is a real game changer for the industry and will increase our chances of survival. This will be the year of the staycation. Our job is to make sure it#s so good that this pattern becomes the normal and is repeated for years to come.The crowd pullers in NI and RepublicTitanic Museum and the Guinness StorehouseTitanic Belfast attracted around .m according to NISRA lastest annual count.

The PSNI has indicated that it will rely on other bodies to help enforce the rules.However, Translink said: Our staff have been helping passengers understand the new guidance and we are pleased to see there has already been a high number of customers using face coverings on our services and at our stations today.At Great Victoria Street station yesterday, commuters were still ided over their use and effectiveness in helping stop the spread of Covid-Inside the Europa Bus Centre, Translink officials were on hand issuing people with face masks as they entered the station and reminding them about the rules.Overall staff said they were happy to see that the vast majority of people were complying. Andrew Cooperfrom Comber had just arrived off the bus from Dublin Airport where he had flown in from Holland. The main problem I find is that my glasses keep steaming up when wearing a mask, he said.Everybody on the bus had one on so people seem to be complying. I flew in from Amsterdam and everyone in the airport had one on as it#s regulatory there also, Andrew added. Possibly it#s a little bit safer when you#re in areas where there are lots of people but who knows.It#s just matter of fact now andyou have to do it then you have to do it, at least until we get a little jag or a tablet. Rafael Henriqesand three friends had travelled up from Dungannon for a day in the city.Having worn face masks already for the past few weeks, Rafael was glad to see it was now the rule for everyone. Everybody had a mask on on the bus and I felt a lot safer. For me there was no dference as I#ve been wearing them for a while so I hope everyone  will do the same, he said. Ursula Grayfrom Pomeroy and her sister Dympna McCluskeyfrom Donaghmore said they were respectful of the need to wear masks. I feel much more comfortable on public transport wearing one, for more my own protection and everyone #s, so I endorse it. We saw one man being handed a mask by a Translink official who chose not to wear it which was a bit disappointing but hopefully people will get the message, Ursula said. Dympna added: This was my first experience of wearing a face mask on the bus. Because it#s mandatory I have no issue although I was glad to get outside and take it off.Sarah Holnessand Derek Cookewere surprised to see some unmasked commuters on the Portadown train. We counted about six people with no masks on the train and others in the station, Sarah said. In fairness maybe they had medical problems but I thought the staff might have enforced it.

It comes as the zoo reopened its doors to the public after being closed temporarily during the coronavirus pandemic. The new giraffe calf was born on May  and is only now getting the opportunity to be introduced to the public. The name was picked as part of a tradition at the zoo that sees any new giraffe calves named after towns and villages starting with Bally. Standing at  foot , Ronan is not the tallest calf ever born at the zoo, but staff say he makes up for what he lacks in height with his personality.Senior keeper Peter Cross said Ronan is in fact one of the shortest giraffe calves born at the zoo but said he is otherwise full of beans. He loves adventure and spends most of his day following his big brother George, exploring the paddock and generally getting up to mischief together.Zoo curator Raymond Robinson said: Both mother and calf are doing exceptionally well. Giraffes give birth standing up and the front feet are delivered first, followed by the head, neck and shoulders. The calf falls more than five feet to the ground which doesn’t hurt but does cause the calf to take its first big breath. Calves are five to six feet in height at birth, learn to stand within  minutes and can run just  hours after birth.The birth came at an exciting time across the zoo following other recent new arrivals, including a Southern pudu and a pair of Scottish wildcat kittens.

But there is no suggestion that Ms Wylie at any time acted inappropriately.Read More Profiled: Workaholic Wylie and #old copper# Grimshaw in eye of storm over Storey funeral are highly capableThe report says the decision by Nigel Grimshaw, the council#s director of city and neighbourhood services to allow up to  mourners to attend the Storey cremation on June  was taken “in the context of managing potential issuesnumbers arrived and demands for access were made”.He now acknowledges that it was “a mistake for which he takes responsibility”, and he regrets its impact on the eight other families.“This was in no way deliberate or politically motivated,” the report adds.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBobby Storey FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBobby StoreyIt says that working arrangements for senior council officers were incredibly dficult and stressful during the coronavirus crisis with “long hours worked without leave”. Those circumstances may have ”played a signicant part” in Mr Grimshaw not seeing his decision “through a wider and more forensic lens”.The report notes that, as Mr Storey was being buried, Ms Wylie was “dealing with a serious personal family issue”. This meant that she couldn’t have an in-depth discussion with Mr Grimshaw and “an important means of scrutiny was lost”.The report also rejects claims that more than  mourners were present at Roselawn for the former IRA leader#s cremation on June  or that republicans took control of the cemetery.It says that  mourners were present, along with seven stewards who stood apart from the funeral party. It rejects speculation that there were paramilitary trappings at the funeral.Decision failed to take account of the perception of dferential treatmentThe report states that an operational decision was taken to permit up to  mourners for the Storey funeral. There appears to have been a focus on this as a profile event, it says and asserts that the decision was taken and signed off by Nigel Grimshaw.It states: The decision failed to take account of the perception of dferential treatment, the feelings of the families and the political context.The report, drawn up by city solicitor John Walsh, was presented to the party group leaders on Thursday night. It states that political contact in the arrangements for Mr Storey#s funeral came in the form of two phone calls from Sinn Fein to the chief executive - one on Thursday  June and one the next day.This amounted to notying the chief executive that the cremation of Mr Storey was planned and requesting details of numbers who could attend. No information was given and the chief executive undertook to have this information provided.Contact for the inidual providing stewarding arrangements on behalf of the family for the funeral was given to Ms Wylie who passed it on to the council#s director of city and neighbourhood services Mr Grimshaw. The report states that, during a discussion with a senior PSNI officer on plans for another high-profile funeral, Mr Grimshaw raised Mr Storey#s cremation with him. He was told another senior PSNI officer would be in contact but this never occurred.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP w BT_KA.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph

that seven republican stewards arrived in two cars.There have been no reports of intimidation or harassment ofstaff. To the contrary, I am advised by council officers that the occasion was respectful.The report states that there were no paramilitary trappings, guard of honour or tricolour on Mr Storey#s coffin. It says that council officers described the occasion as a low-key dignied send-off. The report states: The gates of Roselawn were controlled by council wardens at all times. A review of CCTV shows two meninitially go to the gates at ., one of whom moved away within a few minutes. The remaining middle-aged man stands discretely in the background, coming forward to identy those cars that are admitted into the cemetery grounds by the wardens. There is no suggestion from the images of any concern on the part of these wardens.There is nothing in the CCTV footage that provides any evidence that Roselawn was under control of persons other than council officials.The report says that  mourners were present at the cremation. This is taken from a head count carried out by a member of staff which tallies with the estimate made by a warden that the number of mourners was in the high s, it states.While some staff were sent home,  remained on site throughout, the document states: We are satisfied that there was no political intent in decision making in relation to the cremation of Bobby Storey.The report says the council is following up with families denied the same treatment as Storey#s at Roselawn to ascertainthere is anything we can do that will give them some comfort.Yesterday, the council said it will refund cremation fees to eight families denied access to Roselawn on the day of Mr Storey#s funeral, and would help facilitate memorial services at a future date.

Some hastily arranged Zoom meetings for the Parades Commission to look at the routes. Not-the-Twelfth could be even bigger than a republican funeral.There have been numerous restraining voices from Grand Lodge and unionist politicians, urging respect for social distancing, sensible spacing and online activities. Most will surely adhere. Here they stand apart for they can do no other  But some folk might get carried away. And, to the chagrin of some brethren, the extended bank holiday might involve more songs and Stella than Scripture.But for the tens of thousands who love the Twelfth, the unusual nature of this year#s event could still be joyous. Rather than followers having to travel to appointed demonstration venues, parading will be highly localised. And supporters might cheer on those local bands from their doorstep, enjoying the annual celebration of their history, religion and culture.Given the global pandemic, it is not just in Northern Ireland that the Boyne celebration is in abeyance this year. Parades have been cancelled in several locations: Toronto, Glasgow, Liverpool and Southport march, among others.There has been a notable recent reduction in parading controversies in Northern Ireland, eventhe issues were not truly resolved. Successive surveysshowed nationalists did not want Orange demonstrations skirting their areas, whereas the most common unionist response was support for unfettered parading rights. Proximity to parades was important in shaping attitudes. Surprisingly, though, this year#s University of Liverpool survey found nationalists less happy with the Parades Commission than unionists. One-third of DUP voters felt the Parades Commission was doing either a #very good# or #good job, not many less than the % who thought the commission was performing a #very bad# or #bad# job - and a further % were neutral, stating that the regulatory body was doing #neither a good nor bad# job. However, approval for the Parades Commission falls to one-fth among members of the Orange Order.UUP voters were slightly more critical of the commission than DUP backers. But both sets of unionists showed more support for the commission than Sinn Fein#s voters, only % of whom said it was doing a #very good# or #good# job, with % saying #neither good nor bad# and % declaring it was doing a #bad# or #very bad# job. One-in-six Sinn Fein voters said they did not know.Since the banning of theArdoyne parade on the Twelfth, marching issues have faded in salience. Riots in north Belfast seemed almost an annual feature. But Ross Kemp#s Extreme World series would no longer give the place star billing.This will be an unusual Twelfth, a holiday weekend which, despite all restrictions, will be a celebration for followers of the Orange tradition. Adherents will be desperate for theof full Orangefest next year. But this year#s muted event might yet be traditional in one respect. The forecast says it will end with rain.Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and co-author of Loyal To The Core  Orangeism And Britishness In Northern Ireland  Belfast   Most ReadRevealed: Belfast council internal report into Bobby Storey #low-key dignied send off#NI roads claim the lives of two men in three days Belfast council tight-lipped on bonfires measures as Orange chief urges public to give them a missProfiled: Workaholic Wylie and #old copper# Grimshaw in eye of storm over Storey funeral are highly capableDeath threat against Belfast City Council official Nigel Grimshaw amid Bobby Storey funeral controversy,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Molly Elliott died on June . Molly, who lived in the Top of the Hill area of the city, was -years-old. Her sudden death has left her family and many friends heartbroken. Mollys family say they do not want her death to have been in vain, and have urged her friends and other young people to speak to others about problems they are experiencing. Addressing the congregation at Mollys funeral last week, her aunt, Lynn, asked for prayers for all those without hope. googletag.cmd.push “Help all the young people here today, help them Father to talk, to listen, to hear and to seek the help they need. “This is not the answer,you could all just look to your left, to your right, front and back, you will see mums and dads praying this is not coming to their door. “Please, please let our beautul Molly be the last,” she said. Also speaking at Mollys funeral service, Father Michael Canny said she was a person who had time for others and would chat with themthey were feeling down. “Of course, immediate and extended family were important to her,” said Father Canny. googletag.cmd.push “She also was a volunteer at Hillcrest House and involved down through the years in their summer schemes and other things. “The days ahead will be challenging, most of us will go from here but the immediate family will be left on their own to try to pick up the pieces of le again. “It won’t be easy, le will go on, le goes on, but for you le will be much, much dferent. “But at the same time I think you will be able to reflect on Molly and on the dferent rays of sunshine she brought into your lives.” Mollys uncle, Denny Elliott, said she loved giving and receiving hugs. “She was bursting with affection and would give you hugs that you felt the love flowing from her into you. They’ll now stay with us forever,” he said. “She never shut up - ‘wait til you hear’ she’d say and then you’d just listen and not get a word in edgeways. “Those one way conversations will now stay with us forever.” Mr Elliott said his niece was someone who was there for everybody. “Only last week, Mollys best friend felt a wee bit down and did the right thing, reaching out to his best friend Molly, not knowing for the last time. “Come down for a wee chat and a hug, she said. That chat will stay with him forever.” Mr Elliott said Molly loved her family deeply but they were struggling to come to terms with her sudden death. In a direct message to Mollys friends and other young people, he quoted renowned poet Walt Whitman who wrote ‘the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. “What will your verse be ” Mr Elliott asked of young people. “Let Mollys verse be this: No other young person who knew her or reads about her will ever feel the need to end their le but instead reach out all around them and share their fears, doubts and insecurities to their mothers, fathers, siblings, carers and friends and relations.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr Middleton said: “It is welcome news that the Department for the Economy has been allocated funding from the Executive for the graduate medical school. poundmillion of capital expenditure and poundmillion revenue costs per annum will be ring-fenced. We have been working with all parties in Londonderry to move this issue forward and make it a reality. This is a further step forward to ensuring that in  we will be able to see the first students enrolled. It will be good for the North West but also for the Health Service.” googletag.cmd.push Since the announcement by Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill that a medical school had been approved, key players in delivering the project including the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds and Arlene Foster have spoken of ‘signicant work’ and risk assessments that must be carried out before they can commit themselves to a  opening date. Ulster University previously told the Derry News that when fully operational with  students per year the medical school will cost approximately poundm per year. Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan has also welcomed confirmation from the Executive that funding for the Magee Medical School is ring-fenced allowing the project to move to the next stage. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “Confirmation from the Executive that funding for the medical school at Magee University is ring-fenced is great news for the city. “This will allow the University to press ahead and recruit staff and students for the proposed opening date of September . “It will also enable Ulster University to move to the next stage of the General Medical Council process, with their visit to the Magee campus later this month. “The delivery of the graduate entry medical school will not only enable us to produce doctors to serve our local communities, it will be an important economic driver for the whole North West Region.” It is unclear at this stage whether the ring-fenced money will allow the school to open in .

The issue of redeveloping the derelict Meenan Square site has dragged on for a number of years. Controversial bonfires have been built at the site in the past and over recent weeks materials have been gathered and burned on a regular basis. In February, The Executive Officethrough its Urban Villages Initiative said it was working with Apex Housing Association and other statutory agencies to take forward plans to ‘transform’ the site. googletag.cmd.push This would incorporate youth and community facilities, social housing and small commercial units. At that time locals, including workers at Denis’s Wee Shop and councillors for the Moor area confirmed to the Derry News that people had been asked to vacate premises to allow for demolition of the buildings. The Bogside Inn was supposed to be part of the second phase of redevelopment – possibly years down the line. Demolition work has not yet taken place and TEO was asked why there are further delays. A spokesperson for TEO said: “The Meenan Square site is privately owned and the Department understands the owner did ask businesses to vacate the site in recent months. googletag.cmd.push “Work is continuing by the Department’s Urban Villages team and other stakeholders to allow for development of the site, however plans will be subject to business case and other statutory approvals and community consultation before any construction work can commence.” HEALTH HAZARD Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has said there are several long- and short-term issues that need resolved to deal with the re-development of the Meenan Square site in the Bogside which has become a source of anti-social activity. Karen Mullan MLA said “It’s very apparent that there are short and long-term issues that need to be resolved at this scar site at Meenan Square. “I and Councillor Patricia Logue are dealing with problems around this site on an ongoing basis. “It is a health hazard and an eyesore for the residents of the area who have to look at it daily and deal with the anti-community activity that takes place there. “There must be a collective effort over the summer period to deal with the recurring problems at this site which includes the illegal dumping of materials, the subsequent burning of those materials, the impact it is having in the area and the serious health hazards this throws up.” She added: “There are also child protection issues with some very young children and teenagers being in around a very dangerous site hrs a day. “In relation to any future plans for this site I fully understand the processes involved and that they take time and like everything they have been impacted by the onset of the Coronavirus Crisis and the change of ownership. But all bodies have a responsibility to prioritise this development. “Over the past number of years myself and Cllr Patricia have worked intensely with the owners, the local community, Iona Enterprises, Dove House Community Trust, The Executive Office , Urban Villages and Council to progress the site to development and had hoped that demolition would have taken place before now. “The residents in the immediate area have suffered for too long as this site has been allowed to fall into neglect and dereliction. “I am confident that everyone involved is committed to delivering the proposed regeneration project that we all desire. “I would urge all the stakeholders to redouble their efforts and commitments to ensure that this community gets the facilities and services that the redeveloped Meenan Park will deliver.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly after the announcement, the Derry News asked the General Medical Councilto confirm whether that now means the Medical School will open in September of next year. A GMC spokesperson said: “There are stages that must be completed, required for all new medical school applications, and funding is just one part of the decision process. We will decide on the readiness of the University of Ulster to accept students in September  later this summer, following completion of all these stages.” googletag.cmd.push The GMC carried out a stage  visit to the Magee Campus last July, and so, the next step is to make the stage  decision. That involves a decision to commit resources to rolling quality assurance and to allow the school to recruit students. From that point on it would be a case of monitoring the schools progress before a decision is made which will allow the school toaward its own primary medical qualications. Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton has welcomed the funding assurances for a graduate medical school in Derry. Mr Middleton said: “It is welcome news that the Department for the Economy has been allocated funding from the Executive for the graduate medical school. poundmillion of capital expenditure and poundmillion revenue costs per annum will be ring-fenced. We have been working with all parties in Londonderry to move this issue forward and make it a reality. googletag.cmd.push This is a further step forward to ensuring that in  we will be able to see the first students enrolled. It will be good for the North West but also for the Health Service.” Since the announcement by Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill that a medical school had been approved, key players in delivering the project including the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds and Arlene Foster have spoken of ‘signicant work’ and risk assessments that must be carried out before they can commit themselves to a  opening date. Ulster University previously told the Derry News that when fully operational with  students per year the medical school will cost approximately poundm per year. Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan has also welcomed confirmation from the Executive that funding for the Magee Medical School is ring-fenced allowing the project to move to the next stage. The Foyle MLA said: “Confirmation from the Executive that funding for the medical school at Magee University is ring-fenced is great news for the city. “This will allow the University to press ahead and recruit staff and students for the proposed opening date of September . “It will also enable Ulster University to move to the next stage of the General Medical Council process, with their visit to the Magee campus later this month. “The delivery of the graduate entry medical school will not only enable us to produce doctors to serve our local communities, it will be an important economic driver for the whole North West Region.” LARGER EXPANSION Meanwhile, SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood MP has said that the allocation of funding to the Graduate Entry Medical School in Derry must now see a confirmation that the school will open for an intake in September . The Foyle MP said that the SDLP efforts to secure resource for the Medical School must be the first step in a larger expansion of university provision in the North West. Colum Eastwood MP said: “I’m pleased that funding secured by the SDLP in the New Decade, New Approach negotiations will now be provided to deliver on the promise of a graduate entry medical school in Derry. The people of this city have been denied better university provision for far too long. This was a priority for us when we decided to go back into the Executive and I’m delighted we’ve been able to see progress. “This is good news and we’ll work with all parties in the Executive to meet the target for a September  intake. We need to come together and send a message to our young people that we’re doing everything we can to provide them with the opportunity to live, work and study at home. Our young people are our greatest strength, they shouldn’t be our largest export. “This must represent a first step in a larger expansion of university provision in the North West. We need to be ambitious for Derry and the wider region, investing in skills is critical to transforming our economy. That’s why as MP, I’m committed to working with the Executive and the new Irish Government to deliver new opportunities and enhance higher learning institutions on a cross border basis to meet the needs of people here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new centre, which opened at the start of the month, is an important part of the wider Test, Trace, Protect programme managed by the Public Health Agency. Speaking during the visit the Health Minister said:“Test, Trace and Protect has a vital role to play in helping us move forward into recovery. This, along with other key public health measures, such as social distancing and ensuring good hand and respiratory hygiene, will help us to reduce community transmission of Covid-. googletag.cmd.push “For Test, Trace and Protect to work, everyone in Northern Ireland must prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and be tested to help protect ourselves, our families and our communities.” The Minister added:“This is likely to become part of everyday le for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccine for Covid- is developed and a vaccination programme delivered.” Olive MacLeod, Interim Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, said: “The initial pilot phase of Covid- contact tracing began in Northern Ireland on  April and as of  May we have been tracing all positive cases. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to have this service established and operational. googletag.cmd.push “Our contact tracing team is made up of trained staff who contact the person who has tested positive identy those people with whom they have had close contact and could be at risk of developing Covid- and in turn contact them to advise them on the appropriate next steps.” Mrs MacLeod concluded: “By this stage most people will be aware of Covid- symptoms which are a high temperature a new, continuous cough or a new loss of or change in sense of smell or taste. But people should also be aware thatthey develop any of these symptoms they should get tested for Covid-. More information on testing is available on the PHA website.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This week I want to highlight the plight of many small businesses across the city and tell you what you can do to help them survive. For the past  weeks many businesses have shut their doors and either furloughed staff or made them redundant. Now, however, is the time to get the economy on this Island back up and running. We cant as a society afford to stay shut any longer. There isnt the option to stay closed and until a vaccine is found. googletag.cmd.push This is just fancul thinking and would bankrupt any economy that attempted this strategy. We must learn to live with the virus within our society and shield the most vulnerable from it. The rest of us must take responsibility for our own protection and follow the guidelines set out by government. Both the British and Irish governments in fairness have risen to the challenge and supported businesses and workers for the last four months. The continuation of this support indefinitely isnt economically sustainable. The cost of the support to date has been largely borrowed by governments and will need to be repaid at some stage by raising taxes. googletag.cmd.push There is no such thing as free money from any government in the world. If you get something from government, it will most certainly will be got back by a tax.  So, lets all accept that we have suppressed the virus and now is the time to re-open our economy and get back to work as best we can in the circumstances. Now let us not forget that many of our local businesses watched in dismay as their income streams totally dried up in March. Over the last three months many have had virtually no income, but bills have still mounted up. Some got reduced rates and rents, however bills unpaid since March are waiting for them now as they open. Landlords will be looking rent again and creditors will be looking paid. The Inland Revenue who has been quiet for a while will be back looking for taxes due for last year and on account for . As these small firms re-open their doors and staff come off government furlough schemes the next few months will either make or break them. They really need our support folks so please support themyou can. Very few businesses havent been affected by this crisis and as the economy begins, the bills may come at them quicker than their customers. There could be a bloodbath in terms of bankruptciesphysical re-opening is ahead of consumer confidence. Many local businesses are opening tentatively not knowingcustomers willin the pre-Covid numbers. For some businesses consumer confidence is their biggest issue. Many customers might shun these businesses for fear of catching the virus. The fear factor is still pretty high amongst some consumer groups, but I hope this is confined just to people that fall into the highest risk of infection . For other businesses like restaurants hairdressers etc. the problem will be the new guidelines and how they effect the delivery of the service and capacity of the business. A good example of this can be seen in the recent price hikes announced by hairdressers in Dublin before they re-opened. With capacity reduced signicantly due to social distancing and the additional costs linked to cleaning hygiene etc. many had to increase prices by as much as %. I dont expect increases of this scale in Derry but I have a lot of sympathy for a business that is forced to increase their prices due to reduced capacity. Its not price gauging and has more to do with the current restrictions and capacity reduction. People shouldnt jump to social media with tales of being robbed or fleeced. Its really a case of pricing to survive for many businesses. These next few weeks will be make or break for many companies re-opening after the lockdown so I believe its our civic duty to do as much as we can to support them. What can we do  The simplest answer is get out there and spendyou can afford it. Put the keyboard down and stop buying online unless you really have to. Book a meal and get out there and enjoy a might out. By doing this you are not only supporting your local restaurant but you’re also helping to preserve jobs. Get up the town and spend a few pound, would be my advice. What we all do over the next few months can make a huge dference and could help save hundreds of jobs in the city. If we dont engage with our local businesses, they will be forced to lay people off. Go out and buy a bed for the spare room. Get that much needed haircut. Take the boyfriend out for that steak dinner. We really have to support local shops, service providers and manufacturers now more than ever. And remember, we can do all of this and stay safewe follow the rules, wear a mask and keep the proper distance. Taking holidays in Ireland or a Staycation will also help. And folks this is not me crying wolf. Huge jobs losses are already occurring across these Islands as we come out of this crisis. Intu Properties, which owns or part-owns  huge shopping centres across the UK and Spain, including the Trafford centre in Manchester, has filed for bankruptcy already last week. It will not the last business casualty of the Covid- crisis. So do your bit folks. Get back out there and spend what you can afford locally, and help keeps jobs in Derry.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Now, at the age of , the well-known Derry man has finally done it. Over the last couple of years, Paddy has been writing his memoirs and, from next week, the Derry News will be publishing extracts of his ,-word story. It is a fascinating story which takes in many aspects of his le, from growing up during World War  to running a business in Derrys city centre throughout the Troubles for  years. However, his working le is only part of Paddys story. After retiring, he embraced a love of learning and graduated with a degree in Irish History and Politics from the University of Ulster at the age of . googletag.cmd.push He admits that he was like a grandfather figure to his young fellow students. He continues to enjoy reading and learning about a host of subjects, particularly history. He is a man who likes to keep busy. “I did not want to retire and spend all day sitting in a chair zapping at the TV,” he said. As a result, the last couple of years have been spent working on his memoirs. Paddy was born in  at  Lone Moor Road, the fourth of eight children born to James and Mary McCaul. Paddy admitted that it had been emotional in writing about his parents. googletag.cmd.push “It was only when I was older that I appreciated how good and hardworking people they were,” he said. “My father would have worked all he could to provide for his family and my mother did everything to make sure that her children were fed and looked after. “I have such admiration for my parents but they were people of their time and thats how things were then.” After leaving school, Paddy worked as a clerk in the Great Northern Railway and the City Surveyors Department in Derry. He started employement as a salesman with electrical appliance company Electrolux in . Through relationships built up in this job, he opened his own shop, McCaul Appliances at John Street in . Within a few years, John Street and the rest of the city centre was targeted regularly as part of the IRA bombing campaign. Paddys shop did not escape. In his memoirs, he recalls on one occasion being held at gunpoint as a bomb was planted in the store. He recalls: “My main focus was not on what was obviously some sort of device but on the shaking hand which held the rather ancient-looking hand gun.” McCauls Appliances relocated for a time to the Waterside, before finding a new base at Quayside Shopping Centre where the store remained until Paddy retired in . However, as already stated, Paddy was not keen on taking things easy during retirement. “I always like to keep active and did not want to end up doing nothing when I retired,” he said. He signed up for a Diploma in Foundation Studies for mature students at the University of Ulsters Magee campus in . He is in no doubt about the impact this had. “That course changed my le,” said Paddy. “I had always been interested in reading since I was a young boy and had enjoyed my time at school. “However, coming from a working class family, the focus was always on getting out of school and finding work so you could start contributing to the family. “So it was great to get the chance to indulge my interest in learning at that later stage of my le.” Paddy said he gained a new lease of le mixing with his young student colleagues and is a big advocate of the importance of education. Despite being in his th year, the Derry man keeps himself active with daily walks along the citys quayside. In his long and eventful le, he has seen many changes, some good, some not so good, in his home town. It is a place he is very proud of and very proud to come from. Whilst acknowledging that he would have been well known in Derry, especially through his involvement in business for many years, Paddy describes himself as just an ordinary Derry man. He says he hopes people enjoy reading the story of his le. He insists it is just the story of an ordinary man. Often, those are the best type of stories.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scheme is being run in association with Northern Healthy Lestyles Partnership and supported by Causeway Coast Vineyard and Henderson Retail. The kits include a slow cooker, cookbook and recipe ingredients for two meals and it is hoped they will provide a more sustainable option for shielding households to make healthy meals. Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, Alderman Mark Fielding, said the kits would offer ‘practical support’. “It’s vital that we support the health and wellbeing of those who are shielding and this is a great example of how working with other agencies can enhance the lives of our residents,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “Practical support like this is very important during these unprecedented times, and these kits will make a real dference to vulnerable people across the area.” Michelle Donnelly from Henderson Retail said the initiative was a ‘fantastic idea’. “Since the beginning of lockdown our store teams have been doing all they can for their local communities, from providing home deliveries to the isolated and vulnerable, to helping foodbanks, charities and community groups,” she said. “Providing these ingredients means those who are still shielding can still enjoy a fresh, hot meal without any hassle.

Omniplex have announced the phased re-opening of their cinemas across Northern Ireland. The Strand Road cinema will be among the second batch of cinemas opening on July . In order for staff and guests to enjoy a safe cinema trip, Omniplex have implemented a range of new measures including: - Pre-Booking of tickets– to control the number of patrons in our foyers and auditoriums, tickets need to be booked online. - In-Cinema Seat Separation– the system will dynamically lock empty seats around your booking so you can sit next to your friends but will be distanced from others googletag.cmd.push - Limited capacity– they are limiting the number of guests at any time in the foyer or and screen capacities will reduce by over % - Enhanced cleaning regimes –including screens and all customer touchpoints. Guests will find sanitisation stations in each of our cinemas - Reduced showtimes– only one movie will start every  minutes to facilitate social distancing and extra cleaning. Paul John Anderson, Director of Omniplex Cinemas, said: “We’re delighted to be finally re-opening our cinemas over the next few weeks with a selection of popular classic movies. Guests will notice some dferences during their trip like checking in with a host on entry, directional signage and self-scanning of e-tickets. googletag.cmd.push Also, for the first few weeks tickets will also only be sold online so we can limit the number of guests per show.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Based at the former St Josephs Parish Centre in Galliagh, the new St Pio Centre will be a place were the Friars can carry out their work. The Franciscan Friars first came to Derry in  at the invitation of Bishop Seamus Hegarty. They lived on Abercorn Road for five years before relocating to the Parochial House at St Josephs parochial house in Galliagh, which is now St Columbas Friary. The Friars have since become a familiar sight in the local community and have built up strong relationships with the people who live there. googletag.cmd.push After their arrival in the city  years ago, they became chaplains at St Brigids College and also work closely with Heal the Hurt counselling and addiction service, as well as preaching and teaching. The Friars also celebrate mass at the White Chapel in Galliagh on Tuesdays and Fridays and one weekend a month. It has been great to meet people, said Fr Isaac, one of the Friars. We are not parish priests so its not something we usually have. We feel very much part of the Derry community now, especially in Galliagh. In Spring of , the parish riest of the parish of the Three Patrons, Fr Michael McCaughey, approached the Friars about taking over the former parish centre. googletag.cmd.push After a long series of meetings we decided to lease the centre from the parish and the construction process began, said Fr Isaac. The Friars have knocked down almost half of the old parish centre to create the new Apostolic Centre, which will hopefully be completed by the end of next month. The funding for the new centre was raised by the Friars and the local parish with the help of a number of benefactors. Its our place, explained Father Isaac. Its our first place in the city to do that work that God is calling us to do. The St Pio Centre will have a coffee bar. It will have beautul furniture, and be really well lit with music playing and it will be a place for the Friars to connect with their neighbours, said Fr Isaac. It is our desire that our neighbours in Galliagh will come, but it is open to anyone. Fr Issac says the work of the new Apolistic Centre will be guided by the needs of the local community. We are really excited, said Fr Isaac. In the  years that we have been here we have able to plug into the already existing groups and we have been so blessed to be a part of them. People have asked what sort of services will be available but we will see what needs present themselves,” said Fr Isaac.

There are also crew quarters for up to ten staff.The dining table can accommodate up to  guests and there is a separate bar and lounge areas.It even has its own inflatable flying boat and other toys include sailing dinghies, speedboats, ing gear and fishing gear, and lots more tucked away in its cavernous lockers.Athos spent several days at anchor in Strangford Lough last week and her presence certainly generated plenty of local interest,not from offers to purchase.She is on a long term charter and is currently cruising up the west coast of Scotland.Among the crew members is  year-old Melissa Ramm, from Donaghadee, who works as a deck hand.Her mum, Margaret, was lucky enough to get on board when Athos pulled into Antigua in the WestIndies back in March just before the Covid lockdown.ldquoItrsquos a stunningly elegant yacht, said Margaret. ldquoI would certainly have no problem living on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Book deals usually don’t happen to people like me  ","story":"NOTED for her flair for writing fantasy novels, a Ballynahinch woman is now turning her hand to crime stories after signing a rolling contract with a leading UK publisher recently.Kerry Buchanan, whose award-winning short stories and science fiction books have also been well received by the industries critics, is still in disbelief that her writing career is going so well.Kerry, who lives with her husband, Fraser, and their three grown-up children, Katrina , Lauraand Patrick , is also a full time carer to her  year-old father, Harold Matthews.Kerry, who only began writing shortly before she turned , says their family farm provides a lot of inspiration much welcomed escapism writing.Her crime novels - the Harvey and Birch series ndash will be coming to Amazon in the next few months.Since signing the initial three-book deal with Joffe Books, Kerry says that she feels blessed.ldquoWhen I wake up every morning, I go through the usual check list mdash arms check, legs check, book deal. Book deals usually donrsquot happen to people like me, she jokes.ldquoJoffe were the only publisher I sent my manus to. I was a fan of several of their authors already and I like the way they work with their writers to help them produce their best work.Kerry, who is originally from Yorkshire, settled very easily amid some of Co Downrsquos finest vistas when she married almost three decades ago. She describes how her writing career came about.ldquoI was always a bit of a daddyrsquos girl, so when my father was diagnosed with Alzheimers in , I felt I needed to find an outlet to escape to for some consolation between visits back home. That acted as the trigger.ldquoWhen my mother died a few years later, I brought my father over to live with us and he has since settled in well.ldquoWe are surrounded by horses, hens, dogs, cats, lizards and a few snakes. Maybe not you average farm animals, but we do have stunning views of rolling drumlins, forests and two beautul lakes.ldquoI feel there is an inspirational current with the weather in this part of Co Down. I love it here. Itrsquos a lot like where I grew up.She continued: ldquoI soon set up a make sht work space at the kitchen table, which wasnrsquot the most comfortable but a little of our homemade blackberry brandy helped fuel the senses.ldquoI borrowed my husbandrsquos iPad and after six weeks and some , words later I had completed my first novel.ldquoI never published that one, or the few books that flowed from it. I felt I was just limbering up to a career in writing, cutting my teeth and learning with each page.ldquoWith the books that followed, I grew in confidence and delivery until I felt I could begin to publish them.Kerryrsquos first stories were historical fantasy which she enjoyed working on tremendously, so much so that as more fiction followed, so did the acclaim.She said: ldquoIrsquove been lucky enough to win an ACNI SIAP award in  and then a second ACNI award earlier this year. A short story I wrote called The Armada Tree,won Kraxon Magazinersquos Story of the Year Award.ldquoI am lucky enough to belong to some brilliant writing groups, not least the Hexmen, the Yellow Door Group, and the Belfast Writers Group. Without them, Irsquod still be typing away in a vacuum. They are great people and include some successful writers who have freely shared their knowledge and experience.Kerry has packed a lot of living and experience into her le mdash shersquos worked as a veterinary surgeon, scienticresearcher, computer studies teacher and stable hand.ldquoIrsquove had plenty of le experience to draw upon and inspire me, she said. ldquoSometimes I give talks for NI Libraries to groups of budding writers eager to learn the basics and I often read my work at these events too. I love being able to do this. Itrsquos a way of giving something back for all the terric guidance and knowledge I gained while I was an amateur.ldquoI was so fortunate to have science fiction writer Jo Zebedee take me under her wing at the beginning. She is the chairwoman of TitanCon, a discussion  on science fiction.ldquoWhen she read one of my early pieces, she decided after the first , words that I should publish it.

which inform drivers about their speed are to be erected in Downpatrick, Newcastle, Killyleagh and Castlewellan by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.The signs are to be erected at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick, Newcastlersquos South Promenade, Castlewellanrsquos Dublin Road and the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh.A total of seven signs will be erected shortly across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area as part of the major clampdown on speeders.The move has been welcomed by a number of local councillors including Dermot Curran, Willie Clarke, Billy Walker, Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor who say that the new signs have the potential to save lives by encouraging drivers to slow down in what are heavily populated areas.Cllr Curran said that drivers regularly ignored the mph zone along a large stretch of the Strangford Road.ldquoThis area is densely populated and there are always people walking at this part of the town. A number of accidents at this location have been blamed on speeding, with residents highlighting their concerns about the issue for some considerable time, he continued.ldquoThere is a clear and obvious need for the authorities to get to grips with the speeding problem and the PCSP deserves praise for this initiative. Unfortunately, many drivers think a large part of the Strangford Road is governed by a mph limit which is not case. Residents I have spoken to about the problem say the speed of some vehicles is frightening to say the least.Cllr Curran said that were many housing developments accessed via the Strangford Road which carries a high volume of pedestrian traffic.He added: ldquoWhile welcoming the speed indicator sign, I believe there is a need to move the mph limit back beyond the former Down Council headquarters. Speeders need to slow down before someone is killed.Cllr Sharvin believes one of the real benefits of the announcement is that it has ldquokick-started and energised a conversation among the public about other hot spots for speeding.He added: ldquoI recognise that these signs are an expensive investment but, ultimately, the success of them will be measured in how the public respond to them. If we can begin to see speeds lowered across the district and lives potentially saved, the scheme will have been a success.Cllr Trainor said he hopes the new signs will raise further awareness in driversrsquo minds on the need to reduce their speed along these stretches of road.He added: ldquoWe know that the Strangford Road is a hotspot for speeding traffic and the dangers associated with this. If the new signs reduce speed and help save lives they will be worthwhile, but but road safety is everyonersquos concern.Cllr Clarke said he is ldquodelighted that one of the new signs will be placed at Newcastlersquos South Promenade which carries a huge volume of traffic.He said news of the speed indicator sign will be welcomed be residents who live at this part of the resort and the many pedestrians who walk in the area will be encouraged by the initiative.ldquoI hope that the sign will go some way towards tackling the issue of speeding at this busy part of Newcastle, he said.ldquoThis is a welcome move and something that Sinn Feacutein has been lobbying for over many years to protect residents who live at this part of the resort. The speed sign will also hopefully make South Promenade safer for pedestrians.Cllr Clarke said the PCSP is committed to improving road safety across the district and will continue to work with local communities and local police to make this happen.The Mournes councillor also welcomed the provision of a speed sign at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan which is a main link to a number of towns and villages and carries a high volume of traffic.Welcoming the presence of a new speed sign at the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh, Cllr Walker said that he hopes drivers get the message and slow down.ldquoMany people walk along this particular road and it is vital that everything is done to keep them safe. I hope that thew new sign will act as a deterrent and drivers will ease off the accelerator, he continued.He added: ldquoThe PCSP deserves credit for listening to the concerns of elected representatives and the wider public on the speeding issue. The message must go out that speeders are placing their lives and those of other road users in danger. My appeal to all drivers is to obey the restrictions in place and drive below the permitted level in built-up areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Customers and owners delighted pubs re open  ","story":"PUBLICANS across the district have reported a positiveto opening their doors for the first time since the Covid- lockdown.Bars and restaurants were permitted to open for business last Friday by the Stormont Executive under strict conditions.Customers were only allowed indoors provided they were dining and and non-diners who permitted to drink outside, both socially distanced to m between people.After nearly four months of closure, the reopening was welcomed by publicans and customers alike.Despite being hampered by heavy rain throughout the weekend, publicans reported a generally positive reception by customers experiencing the lsquonew normalrsquo way of socialising.However, several publicans claimed that full compliance to all the drinking regulations was patchy in some towns throughout the district.Stephen Magorrian, owner of Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn in Downpatrick, said while numbers of drinkers and diners were less than normal over the weekend, his customers appreciated the social distancing precautions and measures his team had put in place.ldquoWhile it was probably quieter than I would have liked inside for dining, it was very well received by all our customers who were appreciative of how we had trained our staff and the measures we had in place, said Mr Magorrian.ldquoWe had a lot of very positive comments from customers as they left which we are taking as a good sign.ldquoLast weekend was really about making people feel safe in the hope that they will feel safe for customers and staff and be happy toand word will spread that we are taking their safety seriously.He added that while his team had planned how to cope with larger than expected turnout of customers by hiring a door supervisor, ldquosome other bars really went for it, like it was St Patrickrsquos Day.ldquoWe had no issues with any of our customers who were drinking outside and we were happy to welcome them back.Jack OrsquoHare, owner of OrsquoHarersquos in Newcastle, said he had enjoyed a ldquobusy weekend.ldquoCustomers were delighted to be back and so were our staff.

He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work and needs financial help.Mr Gardiner also said the railway is likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid- and the specic challenges the organisation faces with its trains, infrastructure and operations.ldquoWith no income for the rest of the year, we will face major challenges keeping the railway maintained and ensuring our vital work on our carriages, locomotives, track and stations can continue, he explained.ldquoOur final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont have failed, so now we reluctantly must turn to our members and supporters to ask for help. We need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.Mr Gardiner said he could not see now to resume train operations this year in a way that will be safe and, at the same time, not compound the organisationrsquos financial situation by operating trains at a loss.Mr Gardiner said the railway supported the governmentrsquos call for a total lockdown of activities in the fight against Covid-.Even so, he said the lockdown had a ldquomassive hit hit on the railwayrsquos finances, leaving it struggling to keep ready to reopen when it is safe to do so.ldquoWe have just under pound, of bills to pay this year in essential, unavoidable costs alone, to keep the business in mothballs, Mr Gardiner revealed.ldquoWe have been paying these through our savings which were built up over the past few years but were meant for long-awaited essential maintenance, critical repair and restoration work to safeguard the railwayrsquos long term future.ldquoWe have watched as heritage railways across the UK and Ireland launched fundraising campaigns but, at a time when people were worried about basics such as paying their bills, buying groceries and had worries about their jobs and the health of their families, we felt that it just wasnrsquot right to ask for money for a steam railway, so we tried many other avenues of funding.ldquoOur final hope for funding from Stormont was an application for pound, to the Covid- Charities Fund to cover the day-to-day essential costs we have already accrued to date, but we learnt within days of the application being made that it had been rejected.ldquoThis was our last chance with the government schemes as we did not qualy for funding under either the pound, or pound, business support schemes, designed specically for the tourism and hospitality industry as our rateable value was pound, over the pound, threshold. We were also not eligible for the Micro Business Hardship Fund, the Sports and Clubs or voluntary and community sector hardship funds.The chairman continued: ldquoIn short, we have been rejected for support every time because we were too small, too large, or missing a financial threshold by only a few pounds.ldquoSometimes we miss out because we have a small cash reserve for those vital projects, a reserve which is also made up of legacy donations from benefactors who have passed away and wished their donations to go to landmark projects rather than pay day-to-day bills.Mr Gardiner said the heritage railwayrsquos only public funding was what he described as a ldquomodest grant from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and that a question mark hung over this yearrsquos funding.He added: ldquoWe must thank those MLAs, councillors and public representatives who have lobbied and argued our case, even mentioning us in correspondence with NI Executive ministers as an example of an organisation that appears to have fallen through the cracks.ldquoMany of us within the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway feel deep disappointment and frustration, as it feels like every door we try to open is either locked or closed on us. It also feels like, as a business, we are being penalised for good financial governance.Anyone interested in making a financial donation is asked to visit the heritage railwayrsquos website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Hopes for restoration of Shrigley clock for its 150th anniversary  ","story":"DETAILS of fresh efforts to restore a historic clock which was once the centrepiece of village le in Shrigley have been unveiled.The iconic Martin Memorial clock, which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, celebrates its th anniversary next year.To mark the occasion, Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews is hoping that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Housing Executive will join forces to help put the tick back in the famous clock.He says it is sad to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair and hopes efforts to restore it will be successful to preserve it for generations to come.Designed in  by Timothy Hevey, the clock is constructed of brown stone in three layers, with the base surrounded by iron railings. Originally, there was an elaborate lamp at each corner and also a drinking fountain.While there have been ious meetings over many years to discuss the restoration of the clock, nothing ever happened, something Cllr Andrews hopes that he can help put right.He says while money is tight for many organisations which had to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, he hopes the local council and housing officials will commit to helping restore the famous clock to provide a reminder to current generations of Shrigleyrsquos industrial past.The village was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill has long gone mdash it is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Cllr Andrews believes that residents in Shrigley, Killyleagh and further afield would like to see the clock restored to its former glory and hopes he can secure agreement in principle for this to happen.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the clock to deteriorate further, he declared. ldquoIt is an integral part of Shrigleyrsquos history and it must be preserved.ldquoIn the past it was suggested that a community garden could be developed alongside the clock and perhaps that is something worth pursuing.ldquoI think it is incumbent upon those who can help restore the clock to step forward and perhaps the restoration project is something that the Department for Communities could also lend its support to, given the clockrsquos historic link with the former mill located nearby.Cllr Andrews said that identying funds to finance any restoration work was vital in moving forward, also highlighting the need for an agreed plan to maintain the clock.ldquoThe Martin Memorial clock is at the heart of Shrigleyrsquos history and culture and it must not be lost. It must be preserved and those who can help achieve this must come forward, he continued.ldquoGiven its history, a restored clock could become an attraction for visitors and people researching the arearsquos past.ldquoI hope that I can help harness interest and willingness in number of agencies to weigh in behind a successful regeneration project in the heart of Shrigley.

It turned out it was a good deion!Our motto for the walk, lsquoBe Amazed!rsquo, was inspired by Patrickrsquos Confession in which he recounts his journey to Ireland as a fth century slave before being freed spiritually and physically by God. To be honest I was amazed all seven wanted to do the whole Downpatrick Camino in one day as, for many people, I would recommend two half days. It is not for the faint-hearted!Welcoming everyone, I pointed out the finish time was between pm and pm and the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, kindly turned up to bless us on our way, leading us in the pilgrim prayer, which is found in the new pilgrim passport.ldquoI arise today through Godrsquos strength to pilot me, Godrsquos might to uphold mehellipThe newly produced Pilgrim Passport was to stamped at each point along the way: Saint Patrick Centre, Inch Abbey, Saul Church, Slieve Patrick, Struell Wells, St Patrickrsquos Memorial Church, Downpatrick and St Patrickrsquos Grave.ldquoA wing and a prayer, was how one pilgrim put it.Our journey would usually begin at the Saint Patrick Centrersquos IMAX film which explores the story of Patrick but due to lockdown restrictions we skipped this part and, instead, there was a quick photo-call with the new high viz jackets, sponsored by Phoenix Gas.It was an eclectic group: the aptly-named Hillary who had climbed Tanzaniarsquos Kilimanjaro and another, a journalist, who planned to write about the Way a mother and son with strong links to Downpatrick a married couple, Jim and Marion, from Belfast, who were around retirement age and had walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain and finally their friend, Colette, a casual walker blessed with great faith, a sharp wit and, I recall, a fancy gadget that calculated distance.We set out, climbing St Patrickrsquos Staircase and were headed towards Down Museum when a pilgrim asked me about the building behind us.That panicky feeling from school days when my teacher asked an unexpected question began to rise. My credibility as a guide was at stake. Thankfully I had looked up the school out of curiosity the night before. ldquoOh yes, that school was built about  years ago by the Southwell familyhellipIt seemed to get easier after that as we walked towards the Mound of Down to hear about John de Courcy before marching through the fields towards Inch. We would have to take the Belfast Road, as my dream of having a bridge, or a boat, to cross the Quoile was still a dream.At least the grass was freshly cut and the weather was dry. The Lord was good to us.During the tour at Inch Abbey we met a local man, Roger, who kindly pointed out some little known facts and features including the early ldquospa hot-tub where the monkrsquos infirmary had once stood on the banks of the Quoile.After a break, we set off for the banks of the Quoile River and Saul Hill, the group happily chatting to one another after a lockdown of three and a half months. The Quoile is a gentle part of the walk and as the river flowed, ducklings were paddling behind their mother, like pilgrims on the Way.The Mearne Road was a bit more challenging as the way got steeper but we knew Patrick himself had made this climb on his route to founding the first church on the island. Before long we could see the round tower and had made it in good time, around :pm. A trinity was there to greet us mdash the Centre Director Dr Tim Campbell, pilgrim guide Elaine Kelly and the Dean of Down, who recounted the history of Saul Church.When we arrived at The Barn at Saul, just yards away, we were all ready for the pilgrim welcome, the pilgrim washroom and the pilgrim lunch mdash soup and sandwiches, tea and coffee with carefully observed social distancing.They were a happy bunch as I bade them farewell and offered a lt back to anyone who wanted it. But all agreed they wanted to continue with Elaine to Slieve Patrick and then on to Struell Wells via the Lecale path, what I had dubbed the Way of Tranquility until I fell flat on my face in the mud, going over a stile the week before.Hours later, back at the centre, we waited for the pilgrims to . Around pm a message came through that the mother and son had to leave for an appointment and one of the walkers had hit her wall just before the ancient ones at Struell Wells. I put the kettle on and was relieved to see Colette, the walker from Ballymurphy, coming towards the centre, half an hour later.She was exhausted but in good humour as she regaled us with her observations, including the need for a toilet at Struell Wells. ldquoPilgrimrsquos Pain, she declared, and jokedthat she had less suffering during the Troubles in Ballymurphy.Slumped in her chair with her tea at the St Patrickrsquos Centre, having completed % of the walk, she insisted that the Way was way more than  miles . She referred to a fancy gadget ndash which actually turned out to be accurate. Our five-mile estimate for the morning was closer to six miles and the afternoon closer to ten. So a sweet  miles altogether. What would the other pilgrims say when they got back Like an expectant mother and father, Dr Tim Campbell and I waited. I was looking at my watch and nervously flicking at the kettle switch until we caught the reflection of the high-vis jackets in one of the shop windows.

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added:

The co-consecrators along with myself will be the Bishop of Meath and Kildare and the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe. The preacher will be the Rt Revd Kenneth Clarke, formerly Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh.“Because it is likely that churches will still be operating under strict rules of social distancing in September, attendance will be limited to the family, close friends and colleagues of the bishop-elect, with an opportunity for a more expansive liturgical event at a future date in Belfast Cathedral. However, the service in Armagh will be streamed and recorded.“I would ask you to keep the bishop-elect and his family in your prayers as he prepares for his episcopal ordination.”Speaking in February, Mr Davison said: “The members of the Electoral College for the Diocese of Connor have done me a great honour in electing me to serve as the next bishop of the diocese. \u2028I am very conscious of the great responsibility that is being entrusted to me.”The bishop-elect succeeds the Rt Revd Alan Abernethy who retired at the end of December. Mr Davison was ordained in  and began his ministry in the Diocese of Armagh as Curate of St Mark’s, Portadown . He has served as Rector of Carrickfergus since  and Archdeacon of Belfast since .Meanwhile, the Archbishop of Armagh also announced the Episcopal Electoral College for the Diocese of Clogher will have its first meeting on Wednesday, September , in St Macartin’s Cathedral, Enniskillen, commencing with a service of Holy Communion at .am.--A message from the EditorThank you for reading this story on our website.

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_afaaeebefe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eeaddebaabfbca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.

Guests will find sanitisation stations in each of their cinemas * Reduced showtimes – only one movie will start every  minutes to facilitate social distancing and extra cleaning. These policies will be adapted in line with official guidance. Paul John Anderson, director of Omniplex Cinemas said: We’re delighted to be finally re-opening our cinemas over the next few weeks with a selection of popular classic movies. Guests will notice some dferences during their trip like checking in with a host on entry, directional signage and self-scanning of e-tickets. Also, for the first few weeks tickets will also only be sold online so we can limit the number of guests per show”. Excited cinema-goers will be able to book tickets online at Omniplex.ie  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffacefffdabcec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_befdbcbccacdfbb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
