Is a shooting star okay? Is the laughter of a small child okay?\u0027 he asks. \u0027Pepsi is more than okay!\u0027 Hoping to prove his point, Carrel calls on rapper Lil Jon\u0027 to unleash his trademark \u0027Okaaaaaay!\u0027 before Cardi B suddenly appears to the tune of her hit I Like It. BUD LIGHT  Bud Light\u0027s crossover with Game of Thrones was a hit because it came as such a surprise. What started out as the \u0027Bud Knight\u0027 in a jousting tournament morphs into a promo for the next Game of Thrones season.In the commercial, a king and queen are at a jousting event drinking Bud Light and cheering on the Bud Knight.But the knight is then knocked off his horse by Gregor Clegane, the extremely violent warrior from Game of Thrones.The commercial is aimed at spoofing Clegane\u0027s gouging of the eyes of Prince Oberyn.But the brand didn\u0027t stop there, and aired a second advert aimed at picking a fight with rivals.This time, they took aim at Coors Light and Miller Light for brewing their beer with corn syrup, which Bud does not.The advert has already prompted a real-world backlash, with the National Corn-Growers of America accusing them of failing to support corn farmers. STELLA ARTOIS Stella Artois called on two big names - and a little nostalgia - for its Super Bowl commercial. The ad begins with Sarah Jessica Parker sitting down at a restaurant. The waiter asks if she wants a Cosmopolitan, the drink she made famous as Carrie Bradshaw in Sex And The City. \u0027Nope. Tonight I\u0027ll have a Stella Artois,\u0027 she replies. The shocked restaurant descends into chaos before the Stella arrives at Gellar\u0027s table, but the surprises aren\u0027t over.           Stella Artois called on two big names - and a little nostalgia - for its Super Bowl commercial with Sarah Jessica Parker and Jeff Bridges reprising two of their famous roles from the 1990sThen Jeff Bridges, reprising his role as the Dude from The Big Lebowski, saunters in and also turns down his beloved White Russian. As they sip on their beers, Parker turns to Bridges and tells him \u0027Good choice\u0027. \u0027Well, changing can do a little good,\u0027 he replies before unleashing his famous phrase \u0027Dude abides\u0027. OLAYMany will continue to wonder if they\u0027ve been transported back to the nineties after seeing Olay\u0027s commercial, which features Sarah Michelle Gellar. The Buffy the Vampire star is seen running away from a masked intruder, but can\u0027t unlock her phone to call for help because it doesn\u0027t recognize her face. \u0027I\u0027ve been using Olay! It has totally transformed my skin,\u0027 she tells her friend.           Many will continue to wonder if they\u0027ve been transported back to the nineties after seeing Olay\u0027s commercial, which features Sarah Michelle Gellar in a horror film-setting The masked man finally breaks in, and even he can\u0027t ignore Gellar\u0027s complexion. \u0027Your skin\u0027s glowing, you could be a movie star,\u0027 he tells her. And while the masked man is never unveiled, IMDB reveals that the role was actually played by Gellar\u0027s husband - and fellow nineties heartthrob - Freddie Prinze Jr.  DORITOSDoritos also added a dose of nostalgia to promote its new Flamin\u0027 Hot Nacho chips. The ad begins with Chance the Rapper taking a bite of one of the chips and asking \u0027They made the original hot?\u0027 Chance is then suddenly dancing in front of a purple plane, spitting a few bars as he also dances in front of a purple car, and there\u0027s even a purple fog machine.           Chance the Rapper joined forced with the Backstreet Boys for the Doritos\u0027 Super Bowl ad And, if that wasn\u0027t enough, suddenly the Backstreet Boys appear out of nowhere and its revealed the commercial is actually a spoof of their 1999 music video for I Want It That Way. Dressed in their signature all-white outfits from the video, the Backstreet Boys and Chance begin to perform the tune - complete with the same dance moves. EXPENSIFYExpensify similarly called on the star power of a famous rapper to help tout its app for expense management and receipt scanning. The commercial shows 2 Chainz filming an extravagant music video, complete with a car made out of ice, dancing girls, and seafood towers.           Actor Adam Scott joined 2 Chainz to promote the app Expensify on Super Bowl Sunday But just as he\u0027s getting into his flow, he\u0027s interrupted by actor Adam Scott - who warns him that he\u0027ll need paper receipts for everything in the video.  \u0027Nah, I have Expensify for that,\u0027 2 Chainz confidently replies. BUBLY Michael Buble was the perfect choice to promote Bubly, Pepsi\u0027s version of sparkling water. The famous crooner struggles to get the pronunciation of the drink right, convinced it must be the same as his last name. \u0027You mean Bubly?\u0027 a woman nearby replies. \u0027You\u0027re Michael Buble. That\u0027s a Bubly.\u0027 A little girl then walks up to Buble and asks, \u0027Can I have your autograph Mr Bubbly?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s Buble,\u0027 he tells her before trying to change all the cans to spell out his last name with a Sharpie. BUMBLEBumble skipped the jokes and went for an empowering message to promote its app, which gives women the power to initiate conversations with their matches. The company tapped Serena Williams to star and act as co-creative director in its new campaign, titled The Ball Is In Her Court.           Bumble skipped the jokes and went for an empowering message to promote its app with Serena Williams \u0027We\u0027re living in a world and society where people are starting to understand we\u0027re just as strong and just as smart and just as savvy and just as business-like as any male in this world,\u0027 she says in the commercial. \u0027And we always have been. Now it\u0027s time to really show up and tell our story the way it should be told.\u0027 M\u0026ampM\u0027s Christina Applegate is a frustrated mom in M\u0026ampM\u0027s Super Bowl ad to promote its new chocolate bars. The commercial shows Applegate trying to stay focused on the road as three M\u0026ampM\u0027s argue and scream in the back like rowdy children on a road trip. \u0027Still here - never left!\u0027 Tom Brady, 41, posts emotional...Harry Kane laughs with pundits, Usain Bolt poses pitch side...Share this article\u0027If you don\u0027t stop I will eat all of you right now,\u0027 she says, turning around to yell at them. \u0027I prefer the break us apart option,\u0027 one of them replies. HYUNDAI Jason Bateman was on hand to make fun of the pain of car shopping - as well as eating with vegans. The Arrested Development star plays an elevator attendant in Hyundai\u0027s Super Bowl commercial, except this elevator takes people through uncomfortable situations. There\u0027s root canals, jury duty, sitting on the middle seat of a plane, having the talk about sex with your parents, and that vegan dinner party.           Jason Bateman was on hand to make fun of the pain of car shopping - as well as eating with vegans - in the new Hyundai commercial When the elevator finally reaches car shopping, a couple tells Bateman they\u0027re actually getting a Hyundai. \u0027Going up,\u0027 he replies, taking them to a room full of soothing music and huge windows showing bright blue skies. SKECHERS Tony Romo may have never made it to a Super Bowl, but the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback did get to star in his own ad for the big game. For Skechers\u0027 new commercial, Romo revealed that he likes to \u0027make my life easy\u0027. He shows off a home filled with gadgets, including a robot that picks up his popcorn crumbs, a machine that plays fetch with his dogs, and a floating tray that delivers his drinks. Romo then slips on a pair of Skechers slippers, saying they\u0027re \u0027for those who like things easy\u0027. PLANTERS Planters wanted to remind football fans that peanuts were a worthy snack on Super Bowl Sunday. The ad shows the famous Planters mascot Mr Peanut manically driving his peanut van through busy streets. At one point he passes by Charlie Sheen, who remarks: \u0027And people think I\u0027m nuts\u0027.           Planters wanted to remind football fans that peanuts were a worthy snack on Super Bowl Sunday, tapping Charlie Sheen and Alex Rodriguez for some star power It is then revealed that Mr Peanut has been speeding to reach Alex Rodriguez, who is about to reach for a bag of kale chips.  Mr Peanut knocks the healthy chips aside for a tin of salty mixed nuts instead.\u0027Always there in crunch time,\u0027 a voice says as Mr Peanut winks at Rodriguez, who gives him a thumbs up. BUDWEISERBudweiser was one of the few big names to bypass star power, using an adorable puppy instead. The beer company has long relied on the adorableness of dogs to help sell its beer, and this year was no different. Budweiser\u0027s commercial begins with a Dalmatian happily feeling the wind on his face, the sun shining behind him, as Bob Dylan\u0027s famous tune Blownin\u0027 In The Wind plays in the background.            Budweiser was one of the few big names to bypass celebrities, using an adorable puppy instead as it promoted its use of wind power The camera then pans back to show the Dalmatian is on a horse-drawn carriage full of Budweiser beer. We then see rows upon rows of wind turbines, promoting the fact that the company now uses wind power. \u0027Now brewed with wind power for a better tomorrow,\u0027 the socially-conscious ad declares at the end. COCA-COLA Coca-Cola also wanted to create an ad that came with a powerful message, promoting unity in these politically-charged times. The animated ad shows a flurry of characters - which were inspired by an Andy Warhol cartoon - happily sharing Cokes with each other. They are of various shapes, colors, sizes, and ages, but their love of drinking coke is still the same. \u0027A coke is a coke, it\u0027s the same for everyone,\u0027 a voice reads. \u0027You can get one if you want it, no matter where you\u0027re from.\u0027            Coca-Cola also wanted to create an ad that came with a powerful message, promoting unity in these politically-charged times\u0027He drinks coke and she drinks coke, even though they disagree. And while the bottles look alike, you aren\u0027t the same as me.\u0027 \u0027Stars drink it, chefs drink it, farmers want one when its hot. There\u0027s a coke here if you\u0027re thirsty, but that\u0027s cool if you\u0027re not.\u0027 \u0027We all have different hearts and hands, don\u0027t you see? Difference is beautiful - and together is beautiful too.\u0027 MICHELOB ULTRA  Michelob Ultra, which features Colombian singer Maluma, looked to the future to try and promote its light beer on Super Bowl Sunday. The ad imagines a world where robots walk among humans and, for the most part, outperform us. They are running faster than us on morning jogs, golfing better than us, and killing it at spin class. But when one robot passes by a bar, where friends are sharing a few pints together, one major flaw is revealed - they can\u0027t enjoy a beer. \u0027It\u0027s only worth it, if you can enjoy it,\u0027 the ad reads. And, looking to cash-in on the online phenomenon that has become ASMR videos, Michelob also aired a second ad featuring actress Zoe Kravtiz. As with the viral videos, the commercial features her talking in a hushed voice accompanied by delicate sounds that advocates say can produce \u0027brain orgasms\u0027.THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUEThe National Football League\u0027s Super Bowl commercial featuring past and current legends is winning near-unanimous applause.The two-minute ad, which was directed by acclaimed Hollywood filmmaker Peter Berg, includes cameos by a number of the game\u0027s greats, including Peyton Manning, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Deion Sanders, Jim Brown, Barry Sanders, and others.  The commercial featured more than 50 active and retired players. It was created to celebrate the NFL\u0027s centennial season, which begins later this year, according to The Hollywood Reporter. BURGER KINGBurger King may have won the contest for the edgiest and most original Super Bowl commercial idea on Sunday thanks to its ad featuring Andy Warhol chowing down on a Whopper.The fast food chain\u0027s 45-second spot features Warhol, the artist credited for spearheading the pop art movement of the 1960s, quietly feasting on a burger.Warhol doesn\u0027t make any noise except to briefly express frustration because the ketchup won\u0027t quickly emerge from the Heinz bottle.\u0027It doesn\u0027t come out,\u0027 Warhol says in the clip. PAMPERS   Adam Levine has joined John Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen to remix Legend\u0027s Stinky Booty Duty song in a new Pampers Super Bowl commercial.The original Stinky Booty Duty song debuted last June, with Legend singing to his young daughter Luna while changing her diaper as other dads chimed in.The remix, dubbed Stinky Booty Duty 2.0, features Legend, 40, changing his eight-month-old son Miles\u0027 diaper, getting an assist from Luna and some vocal help from several other dads, including Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine.When Legend takes off Miles\u0027 diaper, he says he\u0027s gonna need some \u0027back-up on this one,\u0027 as Luna peels off some Pampers wipes, before turning to a group of random dads who have their kids strapped to them in baby carriers. Apparently all these dads can hold a tune and harmonize as well, as they start singing the Stinky Booty Duty song, with a surprise appearance from Levine towards the end. HULU - HANDMAID\u0027S TALE  The streaming service pulled perhaps the best bait-and-switch of any Super Bowl ad by starting off their slot with star Elizabeth Moss looking hopefully out of a window as the opening lines of Ronald Reagan\u0027s \u0027Morning in America\u0027 speech are read.But things turn dark fast as scenes from the dystopian TV series are spliced over the top of the President\u0027s stirring speech, before Moss takes over for the last line, saying: \u0027Wake up, America. Morning\u0027s over.\u0027MICROSOFT Microsoft\u0027s tear-jerker of an ad showed off its specially-adapted gaming controller, which allows a disabled child to play video games with his friends.But there was a larger message at play: namely the things that technology can do for people, both in terms of making their lives easier and bringing them together.GOOGLE The tech giant aired two adverts during the game, the first of which focused on how its search engine can be used to put veterans back to work.The second ad promoted its Google Translate service and pointed out that although \u0027words can hurt and sometimes ide,\u0027 the most translated words in the world are \u0027How are you,\u0027 \u0027Thank you\u0027, and \u0027I love you.\u0027Kim Whitler, marketing professor at the University of Virginia, said the ad was an example of how the night\u0027s \u0027most powerful ads focused on unity, positivity and commonality.\u0027MINT MOBILE The wireless provider was trying to stand out from larger rivals Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint. But the \u0027gross-out\u0027 route may not have been the way to do it.The ad compares Mint Mobile\u0027s $20-a-month wireless plan with \u0027chunky milk,\u0027 then it shows a fake ad with a family drinking the unappetizing beverage. A mint-colored cartoon fox says the milk is \u0027not right,\u0027 but Mint Mobile\u0027s plan \u0027is right.\u0027TURKISH AIRLINES Turkish Airlines created a trailer for a six-minute short directed by Ridley Scott, known for directing Apple\u0027s iconic 1984 ad. It was the storied director\u0027s first return to the Super Bowl in decades. But some viewers took to Twitter to express confusion over what exactly the ad was trying to promote.CBS - TWILIGHT  ZONEAnother highly-convincing bait-and-switch advert, it appeared to show the game had restarted in Atlanta before cutting to an empty stadium with Jordan Peele standing in the middle.\u0027Witness an empty space, filled with thousands of screaming people,\u0027 Peele says in calming Twilight Zone toned voice.He adds: \u0027A man both nowhere and everywhere at the same time,\u0027 as he sits in several different seats, and stands on the field, all at the same time.\u0027Answers are new questions,\u0027 he reads on to a shot of the familiar Twilight Zone spiral tunnel. \u0027The unthinkable is the expected.\u0027He concludes with: \u0027When truth is not the truth, what dimensions are you even in?\u0027TURBOTAX The sinister nature of artificial intelligence featured heavily in Super Bowl ads, perhaps exemplified best by Turbotax\u0027s robo-child who yearns to do taxes.SIMPLISAFE Simplisafe also produced a fear-laden advert for its Super Bowl slot, playing on anxieties ranging from the news, to other humans and AI once again.The message: Simplisafe can protect you from everything nasty in the world outside, which happens to be everything in the world outside. SPRINTSprint\u0027s robots were some of the few to feature in Super Bowl ads without sinister overtones, helping to come up with a bizarre concept for a commercial that features Bo Jackson, holding a mermaid, playing a keytar, next to a bird-horse.Instead, Bo suggests they should just keep it simple by pointing out that Sprint can save people a lot of money when it comes to their phones.PRINGLES Pringles also went down the AI route, with two men stacking up the chips in different flavor combinations before wondering aloud how many combinations there are.A smart microphone then pipes up from the corner to answer the question, before going off on a tangent about how she will never taste any of them. She says: \u0027I have no hands to stack with, no mouth to taste with, no soul to feel with, I am at the mercy of a cruel and uncaring...\u0027 \u0027Cool, play Funky Town,\u0027 one of the men cuts in.WIX.COM Relying on star power to get their message across, website building service Wix brought in Karlie Kloss for their slot.The commercial shows the model updating her website with new photos while connecting to the likes of Google to make sure her site can be found by browsers.WASHINGTON POST Despite researching showing the Super Bowl viewers feel the game is a bad place to make a political point, the Washington Post went in hard with their ad, entitled \u0027knowing keeps us free\u0027.Narrated by Tom Hanks, it recaps moments in American history that were encapsulated by news coverage, before recapping three prominent journalists killed while reporting - including the Post\u0027s own Jamal Khashoggi.It ends with the mantra: \u0027Knowing empowers us. Knowing helps us decide. Knowing keeps us free.\u0027AVOCADOS FROM MEXICO One of the more bizarre adverts to grace screens on Sunday night - it featured humans competing in a dog show for a prize of avocados.A contestant was showing rolling over - his 401k - while another woman ended up wearing a cone of shame after breaking ranks and running towards a table covered in guacamole.VERIZON Verizon chose to honor first responders in its Super Bowl advert, which also featured LA Chargers coach Anthony Lynn.Lynn recounts how he was badly injured in a 2005 car crash to a group of emergency workers, saying: \u0027I promise you I wouldn\u0027t be here today if it wasn\u0027t for the first responders.\u0027Then, in a tear-jerker moment, members of the crowd step forward to reveal they helped to save his life.T-MOBILE T-Mobile spent big on the Super Bowl, airing one advert per quarter, though none of them were especially memorable.Instead, the network used the expensive slots to announce a series of giveaways for customers, including free Lyft rides and free Taco Bell.AVENGERS: ENDGAMEMarvel Studios debuted a new 60-second trailer for the highly-anticipated Avengers: Endgame during the Super Bowl LIII telecast.The highly-anticipated superhero adventure will bring Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to a close, and is set in the aftermath of the devastating events of 2018\u0027s Avengers: Infinity War.COLGATE Luke Wilson made a celebrity cameo for this advert where he plays a \u0027close talker\u0027 - harkening back to an old Seinfeld episode.Wilson is firmly of the opinion that - thanks to Colgate\u0027s cleaning power - there is no such thing as talking \u0027too close\u0027 to somebody.\u0027Yes, there is,\u0027 an irritated mail man informs him.CAPTAIN MARVEL Marvel Studios debuted a new 30-second trailer for Captain Marvel during Super Bowl LIII, which showcases how this movie will take the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \u0027higher, further, faster.\u0027Brie Larson stars as Carol Danvers, an Air Force pilot who, after a mysterious explosion with Kree technology, is imbued with incredible powers, which are on full display in the new trailer.WONDER PARKParamount\u0027s all-star animated film - based on a theme park ride - makes its pitch for Easter family movie in this trailer.Featuring the vocal talents of Kenan Thompson, Jennifer Garner, Mila Kunis, Matthew Broderick and John Oliver, it imagines what would happen if a child\u0027s dream theme park became a reality.WALMARTWalmart relied on an entirely different kind of star power for its ad, which featured famous vehicles instead of famous faces.Transformer\u0027s Bumblebee, Back to the Future\u0027s Delorean, and Ecto-1 from the original Ghostbusters are among a dozen vehicles to feature in the spot.RAM  Having been blasted for using a Martin Luther King speech to sell trucks back in 2018, this year sees RAM in a pensive mood - reflecting on the adverts of yesteryear.Two cowboys packing up their harnesses discuss what happened in all of the ads, though neither of them can remember what product they were selling.\u0027They just need to show you what they\u0027re selling,\u0027 one of them says, before climbing into his truck and starting the engine. MERCEDESAnother brand to air two spots during the game, Mercedes\u0027 first featured Ludacris who went to the Ron Clark Academy to surprise students.The surprises didn\u0027t stop there, however, as he handed out two tickets to the Super Bowl to two lucky pupils.The car brand\u0027s second slot features a man bending the world to his will using only the power of his voice - from finding cats to rescuing people trapped in an elevator, and giving away thousands of dollars.\u0027If only everything listened to you like a new A-Class,\u0027 the ad finishes.AMAZON PRIME - HANNAOriginally an oddball thriller film by Atonement director Joe Wright and starring Cate Blanchett, Amazon has taken the concept and turned it into a series.Fan will be able to watch the first episode online for 24 hours after the game ends. TOYOTA The car maker sets out to \u0027shatter perceptions\u0027 in this ad, featuring Toni Harris - the woman who wants to become the first to play in the NFL.Recapping Harris\u0027s incredible journey, including all the things she was told she could never be, Toyota says it has \u0027never been a fan of perceptions\u0027 before introducing its new RAV-4 Hybrid.HOBBS AND SHAW The latest trailer for the Fast and Furious spin-off which will feature Dwayne \u0027The Rock\u0027 Johnson and Jason Statham reprising their roles as lawman Luke Hobbs and lawless outcast Deckard Shaw. The pair face off against \u0027bad guy\u0027 Brixton - played by Idris Elba - who has gained control of an insidious bio-threat that could alter humanity forever.It is left to Hattie Shaw - Deckard\u0027s sister, played by Vanessa Kirby - to bring ther brother and his sworn enemy together to bring down Brixton. NETFLIX - OUR PLANET Having dominated the true crime market with  Making A Murderer, the streaming giant\u0027s latest foray into the world of documentaries sees them turn to nature.This looks set to be another winner, since Netflix has teamed up with veteran documentary-maker David Attenborough for the series.KIA When you cannot be known for who you are, you must make yourself know for what you do -

Questions have persisted about whether Gronkowski might call it quits on a grueling career that has included significant injuries and multiple surgeries.\u0027It\u0027s really not about that tonight, it\u0027s about celebrating with my team tonight,\u0027 Gronkowski said in a postgame interview with NFL Network. \u0027I\u0027m going to take a few weeks, a week or two, see where I\u0027m at, make a decision from there. But tonight it\u0027s about celebrating with the team, celebrating with everyone. We were grinding, what, seven months since training camp, putting the work on. It paid off, and now it\u0027s time to celebrate.\u0027Gronkowski hauled in six catches for 87 yards in the Patriots\u0027 13-3 win over the Los Angeles Rams. His 29-yard catch in the fourth quarter helped to set up Sony Michel\u0027s 2-yard rushing touchdown, which put New England ahead for good.The nine-year veteran tight end credited Tom Brady with putting the ball in a perfect spot.\u0027On that play, we saw that there was a matchup right there,\u0027 Gronkowski said. \u0027There was a linebacker on me, and that\u0027s when I knew the ball was going to come to me. I knew Tom was going to throw it up there and (I could) just run up and make the play. It was a crucial play, and Sony just did the job finishing it off with a touchdown, which was awesome.\u0027Gronkowski was willing to clarify one question about his future: Yes, he planned to party Sunday night and beyond.\u0027Bill (Belichick) said he\u0027s partying tonight, and I ain\u0027t going to let him out-party me,\u0027 Gronkowski said with a grin.

They routinely sent an extra deep safety on third-and-short situations and disguised their blitzes up the middle. The latter benefited linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower, who dropped Goff for a pair of sacks to stunt drives.New England finished with four sacks for the game.\u0027We\u0027re a relentless team,\u0027 linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower said. \u0027We didn\u0027t give up. A lot was thrown at us. When we play like we did tonight, we can\u0027t be beat.\u0027 It added up to an abysmal performance by Los Angeles on third-down situations. The Rams were 0 for 6 on third down in the first half and 3 of 13 for game. New England also held Los Angeles to just 260 total yards. The Patriots defense deserves much of the credit for the close score after holding the Rams to just 78 first-half yards.The first half was certainly a departure from the regular season, when the Rams and Patriots ranked second and fifth, respectively, in offensive yards. On Sunday the two teams combined for nine punts on the first ten drives of the game. In fact, the Rams had never gone scoreless in a first half under coach Sean McVay until Sunday against the Patriots. Los Angeles actually entered halftime with only 78 yards, compared to 195 for New England.  Edelman had 93 receiving yards in the first half, outgaining the Rams\u0027 offense by himself. The six combined points were the fewest scored by two teams through the first three quarters of Super Bowl history.           Tom Brady was intercepted on the Patriots\u0027 opening drive in Super Bowl LIII           View of the Mercedes-Benz Stadium prior to the Super Bowl LIII between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in Atlanta on Sunday The Rams appeared to be driving for a touchdown in the third quarter, when Patriots linebacker Dont\u0027a Hightower\u0027s sack of  Goff left Greg Zuerlein with a 53-yard field goal attempt, which he converted to tie the game.  Brady\u0027s pick was nearly caught by Patriots receiver Chris Hogan at the Rams\u0027 27-yard line, but the ball deflected into the waiting hands of Los Angeles linebacker Cory Littleton. The Patriots took a 3-0 lead in into halftime thanks to a 41-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski in the second quarter. He previously missed a 46-yard attempt in the first quarter, which was the first missed kick by any NFL kicker this season in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the home of the Atlanta Falcons.            Adam Levine of Maroon 5 performs during the Pepsi Super Bowl LIII Halftime Show at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on February 3, 2019 in Atlanta, GeorgiaThe Patriots registered five first downs in the first quarter compared to just one for the Rams, but Brady and New England\u0027s offense still failed to score a point despite driving into Los Angeles territory on their first three possessions.   Brady also has a fumble in the first quarter, which was recovered by the Patriots. Besides Patriots fans, New Orleans Saints supporters also celebrated the outcome of Super Bowl LIII. The Saints seemed destined to beat the Rams in the NFC title game before a blown call ultimately led to Los Angeles\u0027 come-from-behind win.   With the teams tied 20-20 late in regulation, officials failed to call pass interference or helmet-to-helmet penalties on Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman for knocking Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis down as he awaited a pass.

The Tornado can trace its DNA all the way back to work by Sir Barnes Wallis, better known for developing the ‘bouncing bomb’ used by 617 Sqn ‘The Dambusters’ in 1943, who began work on variable geometry (VG) wing designs in the 1950s. He realised with a VG aircraft’s wings swept forwards - spread wide - it could use shorter runways and display greater manoeuvrability, and by sweeping them back could achieve maximum high-speed performance.Although no planes were built from his designs, VG wings became commonly used on fighter aircraft through the latter half of the twentieth century, including on the Tornado.It was initially created by a British-German-Italian conglomerate, Panavia, which was set up in Germany to build the craft.The Tornado programme was initiated in 1968, and the first prototype flew on 14 August 1974. The initial RAF requirement was for 220 aircraft, and the first of these was delivered to RAF Cottesmore in July 1980, becoming the mainstay of the RAF strike force in June 1982. RAF Tornados took part in the 1999 Kosovo war and the GR4 upgrade was completed in time for Operation Telic, the UK\u0027s deployment in Iraq from 2003 to 2011. Tornados were used in Afghanistan from 2009 until the withdrawal of UK forces in 2014. According to the Ministry of Defence, they flew over 5,000 sorties and logged more than 33,500 flight hours during this time.           The sun sets on the Tornado: The powerful jets were conceived in the late 1960s, based on previous work by Sir Barnes Wallis of \u0027Dambusters\u0027 fame.  They flew for the first time in 1974 and entered service in 1979.

He was said to have been given a ticket to an Asian Cup match between Qatar and Iraq (pictured) and arrested for wearing a Qatar shirt\u0027Both the initial arrest and the escalation of charges are clearly politically motivated acts by the police and Ali is being victimised merely to send a signal to Qatar in the run-up to the World Cup. \u0027This is a gross violation of his rights, and the only signal it sends to the international community is that the UAE is an unsafe destination.\u0027 The Foreign Office is warning tourists that showing sympathy for Qatar on social media or otherwise is an offence punishable by a fine of imprisonment.In June 2017 Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt launched a diplomatic and transport blockade of the tiny Gulf state accusing it of cosying up to Iran and supporting terrorism, which Doha denies.On Friday Qatar lifted the Asian Cup after beating Japan in the Final.

The family did not report Amber missing until they had \u0027been to Tesco and had their tea\u0027. Pictured above the missing poster which was put up once it had been reported that Amber was missing Ms Bower was told two calls were made from Queen Elizabeth School in Mansfield, which Amber attended at the time of her death, to MASH before the tragedy – one in September 2014, and another six months later.Both times a worker took information from the callers – one of whom was a key worker at the school and the other its vice principal - and handed it on to a qualified social worker.But the inquest was told the case didn\u0027t pass a \u0027threshold\u0027 that would have triggered statutory social services intervention.On the second occasion the caller from the school was told to go back to Amber\u0027s parents and \u0027discuss\u0027 the claims she had made without any evidence the potential impact on her of doing so had been assessed – something Ms Bower said \u0027shocked\u0027 her.The coroner told MASH group manager Teresa Godfrey: \u0027In the world of safeguarding there should have been an explicit conversation about risk.\u0027The first call to the safeguarding unit was made by Queen Elizabeth vice principal Karen Green.But MASH officer Elizabeth Fisher, who took the call, said the information provided was \u0027limited\u0027 and \u0027without context\u0027 – and didn\u0027t satisfy the criteria for a full social services referral. Instead, the school was advised to carry out an \u0027Early Help\u0027 assessment – something it ultimately didn\u0027t do.However, Mrs Fisher did accept a suggestion from Ms Bower that she could have asked more questions and \u0027dug a little deeper\u0027 to gain a wider picture of the situation. She said evidence she had heard during the inquest about Amber while sat in the public gallery had left her \u0027shocked\u0027.A second call was made to the MASH team in March 2015, two months before Amber\u0027s death, by her school key worker Sharon Clay.She reported concerns over Amber wearing ill-fitting tracksuit bottoms to school, which the inquest has previously heard she was made to do by Mr Peat after failing to put her normal trousers in the wash, and bringing her items in a cheap plastic bag.Ms Clay added that she thought Amber was being \u0027emotionally abused\u0027 by her stepdad, who had also ordered her to wash the floors at 11.30pm at night.However, the concerns again weren\u0027t enough to merit the involvement of social services.MASH worker Joanna Shepherd, who took the call, said \u0027you would need more incidents over a period of time\u0027 – adding she was not aware at the time of the \u0027bigger picture\u0027 surrounding Amber.The inquest heard Mrs Shepherd had no knowledge of the earlier call. She told the hearing she could have asked for more details – but would have expected the caller to give a \u0027full picture\u0027.After getting the advice of a social worker, Mrs Shepherd told Ms Clay the school should go back and discuss the matter with Amber\u0027s mum.But Ms Bower asked if any thought had been given to the impact it could have on Amber if the disclosures she\u0027d made to her teacher were passed back to her parents, adding: \u0027As we discuss this now, do you see the concerns I am raising?\u0027Mrs Shepherd replied: \u0027Yes. But I could not question the social worker on that.\u0027The hearing was told that since Amber\u0027s death procedures had been put in place, including better recording systems, that aimed to gather and collate information better.The inquest continues.   If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article then you can call the Samaritans on 116 123, alternatively you can visit the website at by clicking here.    "},{"url":null,"title":"Bafta nominated movie director went total Harvey Weinstein","story":"    Stephen Fingleton, 35, allegedly attacked the woman after meeting her at a British Film Institute event in Leicester Square in October 2017An actress who claims she was sexually assaulted by a Bafta-nominated director told a friend he had been \u0027her Harvey Weinstein\u0027, a court heard.Stephen Fingleton, 35, allegedly attacked the woman after meeting her at the opening gala night of the British Film Institute\u0027s film festival in October 2017.The pair then scheduled to meet for lunch, but the actress suggested the director came to her three-bedroom flat, which she also used as an office, for a \u0027business meeting\u0027 instead.\u0027She had invited him to her home for lunch to discuss the possibility that she might be cast in one of his films,\u0027 prosecutor Jocelyn Ledward told Isleworth Crown Court.\u0027During that meeting, he assaulted her. The defendant says that it simply did not happen.\u0027Fingleton arrived at the woman\u0027s home on October 27, 2017 and the pair sat at a table discussing work. But the director then began a \u0027sexual conversation out of the blue\u0027 and asked if she had done any nudity on film, the court heard.The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has previously had \u0027minor roles\u0027 in two Hollywood films. \u0027At the time the raising of sexual topics did not alarm her,\u0027 said the prosecutor.\u0027She told the defendant she was a recovering alcoholic and a sex addict and that she had attended AA meetings.\u0027Seemingly out of the blue the defendant touched her shoulder and she started to feel uncomfortable.Disgraced Virginia governor Ralph Northam is now on...It has nothing to do with us!

He pulled her towards him and tried to kiss her.\u0027The actress tried to defuse the situation by suggesting they watch one of her films in the living room.But he kept insisting they move into a darker room, like her bedroom, as he had a projector app on his phone.

He then allegedly asked her to perform a sex act on him. When the actress told him that she thought this was a business meeting, the director said \u0027I do not separate the two\u0027, the court heard. Fingleton eventually left at around 3:30pm, after spending more than two hours in her flat. The actress later told a friend she had been sexually assaulted.In a reference to the disgraced Hollywood mogul, the prosecutor said: \u0027She met with a friend and said he had been totally her Harvey Weinstein\u0027.

He said that I looked like I had been with a girl before. I asked him why he said that and he said that girls like to explore.\u0027She said it was a bit odd that he was asking those questions, but at that stage she thought it might be related to his film.But the actress began to feel uncomfortable when he deliberately touched her shoulder as he went to retrieve a notebook, the court heard.Fingleton is a writer and director who has made a number of films.

He has inspired and infuriated generations of listeners and we’ll miss him. He represents something increasingly rare.People who don’t listen much to the programme sometimes read stories about complaints over his interviewing style, and assume this is some musty old gammon, an upmarket patriarch. Not so: the essence of John Humphrys is a bounding, hybrid vigour.If the BBC was a dog show, its public-school Dimblebys, Vines and Edward Stourtons would be high-bred, languid Great Danes or well-trained gundogs (and Paxo a pedigree Alsatian of elegant appearance but uncertain temperament).Humphrys would be a scrappy, scruffy mongrel terrier. Off he’d go, chasing every rabbit, catching every ball, leaping on the grandest sofa with mud on his paws and a bark of amused defiance.Here is the news: John Humphrys to QUIT the Today programme...From rustling sweet wrappers in cinemas to those ‘sorry you...BBC\u0027s focus on \u0027erse\u0027 comedy is just \u0027PC panic\u0027 that...The vulnerable teenager abused and discarded by powerful men...Share this articleIt is quite wrong to identify him with what the BBC calls ‘a babble of poshness’ in its absurd new recruitment ad to attract journalists from erse backgrounds.He was born in Cardiff to a family that knew hunger one great-grandmother, he discovered, was in the workhouse. He left school at 15 despite a grammar-school scholarship and did paper rounds (his first pay packet in the Fifties was £1.17s.6d on the Penarth Times, less than he got from the paper round so he kept that going, too).John was the first reporter at the Aberfan disaster when 116 children and 28 adults died as a junior school was engulfed by a coal tip.The trouble with such ‘great moments’ in journalism, he reflected, is that they are also great tragedies: for all his toughness, there is deep and honest sentiment in him. He worked as a foreign correspondent, set up the BBC New York bureau — a boozy, raucous time by all accounts.On the road, he reported on everything from Britain’s dock strikes in the Seventies to Nixon’s resignation and the moment when Rhodesia became Zimbabwe.          On the road, he reported on everything from Britain’s dock strikes in the Seventies to Nixon’s resignation and the moment when Rhodesia became ZimbabweHe was diplomatic correspondent, then for a few years anchored the Nine O’Clock News at the point when newsreaders, for the first time on the BBC, doubled as writer-editors (in the cut-glass days of Angela Rippon, they didn’t).But his arrival on Today to join Brian Redhead sparked a love affair with the job: he revels in the sheer fun of being first up in the morning with a story to tell.He reads the papers with fierce attention and swallows complex briefs fast.Aggressive at times, contrary quite often, he is fuelled by the adrenaline of news and genuine interest. Inside him vibrates the inquisitive, argumentative, determined cub reporter he was, loving intellectual friction. There is nothing smug or entitled he does not trade in long, self-important complicated questions but often in alarmingly brusque simple ones.His stamina is amazing: I presented Today four days a week for three-and-a-half years up to 1981, and remember the 3.30am alarm clocks, the briefings read with bleary eyes, the empty stomach assaulted by too much coffee.But he thrives: in recent years I had to visit the Today studio for the live trail of Midweek, and it was always bouncier when John was on. He would take his eyes off the ubiquitous prompt-and-briefing screens to crack some joke during a tape, or shove me a flippant note during the sports news.After one particularly gruelling live political interview, the note told me how he was feeling: ‘Always terrified after all these years.’That is the essence of Humphrys: taking nothing for granted, including his own abilities.As for the money, he was much maligned during the row about the gender pay gap at the Beeb. Executives will confirm that he never asked for the absurd sums which the BBC at one point paid him — reportedly £600,000 a year.He spends millions on his Kitchen Table Charities Trust, supporting small causes including sanitation and dignity projects for teenage girls in sub-Saharan Africa.He willingly halved his salary when the BBC anxiety about pay began. But after former China editor Carrie Gracie returned to the BBC newsroom and justifiably complained about insulting inequalities in pay, some mean spirit leaked a tape of John teasing North America editor Jon Sopel.‘How much of your salary are you prepared to hand over to Carrie . . .’ he was recorded saying. ‘I’ve handed over more than you f***ing earn but I’m still left with more than anybody else . . .’There was confected outrage against him — the then Loneliness Minister, the ridiculous Tracey Crouch even refused to be interviewed by him about anything.But if you actually listen, it is clear that Humphrys is sending up and winding up his soberer colleague, pretending he would ask him about it on air while Sopel was reporting on Trump. It’s quite funny: newsroom banter. Women do that, too, you know.But in any case, money is not what drives Humphrys: the fun of the job does. He won’t much like it when he does retire.Curiosity, enjoyment and a bit of nerviness give him his edge. Live radio is both fun and alarming if you lack a carapace of smug over-confidence.If he has seemed belligerent at times, deploying his full armoury on too small a target, as a listener I generally put it down to a sort of overspill of frustration with the absurdity of the whole world: ‘Lord, what fools these mortals be!’As for his mild — and I suspect deliberately clowning — bafflement of popular culture, either you laugh with him and mutter, ‘Keep up, grandpa!’ or be po-facedly offended.I, too, have shouted at him for interrupting someone really harmless, and as Today’s editor, Sarah Sands, weakly murmured after one entertaining car-crash moment with former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman: ‘Fashion isn’t John’s area of expertise.’He had teased Shulman about unhealthy body shapes and uncomfortable shoes, and she lamented: ‘I was confronted by a grey-haired guy in chinos hectoring me on the business I had worked in for a quarter of a century and which he neither knew, nor cared, much about.’          That is the essence of Humphrys: taking nothing for granted, including his own abilitiesBut who could resist his blokey challenge to absurd fashion columns about the French tuck (leaving half your shirt hanging out like Meghan Markle). When men do it, they’re slobs, he said, but with women it’s fashion, adding: ‘As for ripped jeans. I rest my case.’Another pointless row came after he asked actor Rupert Everett whether he regretted, for career reasons, having come out as gay.There was prim fury all over Twitter, but Everett had talked about this before, and made it clear that, yes, it had damaged him. And he was on Today to discuss his film about Oscar Wilde’s disgrace.Would you prefer a veneer of pretend respect for everything, or a bit of grit? Is it not worth it for moments like Humphrys’ ferocious demolition over Jimmy Savile of BBC Director-General George Entwistle — Humphrys’ ultimate boss at the time?Or DUP politician Nelson McCausland’s comment that his was ‘a compassionate party’, only to have Humphrys respond: ‘Compassionate? I think if you were a gay person or a woman wanting an abortion . . .’Maybe our appreciation will grow with memory, and many of the charges against him weaken on examination: Former Home Office minister Hazel Blears was indeed interrupted several times in an interview about police intelligence failures, but reading the transcript you notice she simply isn’t answering a straight question.And misogynism? Nothing could be further from the truth. He cheered me on during my BBC years to the end, and long maintained that Today needs a woman editor.As for his most furious detractor, Tory minister Jonathan Aitken did accuse him of ‘poisoning the well of democratic debate’. But four years later was himself jailed for perverting the course of justice.No, on balance John Humphrys has been, for more than 30 years, a tonic — like a cold, clean, bracing morning dip.

When your life has been blighted by this scandal and you are still living this nightmare daily, and you hear what she is saying, it is just not acceptable.          Joanne Darbyshire (pictured) claims she was mis-sold her home in Bolton because of hidden ground rentsThey have since been given a quote of between £23,000 and £33,000 to buy their home in Lostock, Bolton, outright.They have been offered an RPI-linked ground rent contract by Taylor Wimpey but say this would still mean paying £10,000 to buy the freehold.Mrs Darbyshire, right, says: \u0027There\u0027s no end in sight. People say to me you should have read the small print but none of these things were in there.\u0027Andrea Harris bought a three-bedroom terraced house from Taylor Wimpey – but says she wasn\u0027t told about ground rent.The 39-year-old purchased the property for £160,000 with her former partner in 2008.          Andrea Harris (pictured) also claimed she was not told about the ground rent However, she was then hit with an annual ground rent bill of £200, which doubled to £400 last year. In another ten years it could double again to £800. Miss Harris, who lives in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, now says she cannot sell the house and cannot afford to pay down the mortgage or buy the freehold.She says she is stuck making mortgage interest payments on a home she fears she\u0027ll never be able to pass on to her daughter Gabriella, eight, pictured left with her mother.Miss Harris said: \u0027I wanted this to be a family home that I could pass on ... but now I will never be able to do that.\u0027The Government isn\u0027t doing anything to help people like me – we\u0027re still stuck with crippling ground rents every year.\u0027                                                    Home Secretary Sajid Javid vowed when he held the housing portfolio to outlaw the use of leaseholds on newly-built homes in December 2017, branding the practice \u0027feudal\u0027.But more than a year later, campaigners say those trapped in toxic contracts are no closer to escaping them.Despite many leaseholders claiming they were not made aware of the full terms of their contracts, and suggestions it was similar to the PPI scandal, Mrs Wheeler said she did not agree it was an example of mis-selling.The 59-year-old, who owns her constituency home in Burton-on-Trent outright according to the Land Registry, previously sparked controversy when she tweeted that the \u0027British Empire\u0027 came first with 396 medals in the Rio Olympics, referring to Britain and countries that were formerly its colonies.Mrs Wheeler told MPs the comparison to PPI was difficult \u0027because in effect with PPI you were sold something you really didn\u0027t need, whereas this is completely different\u0027. She added: \u0027There is a contract, there was legal advice but perhaps people are caught up in the moment because it is their first purchase and it is incredibly exciting.\u0027\u0027We\u0027ve been fleeced for years and it\u0027s come to an end\u0027:...Wimbledon tennis chiefs are on the brink of buying...Fleeced on their leases: The families being hit with soaring...Flat owner who had new kitchen and bathroom fitted has...Share this article"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1431fe1e745750beba606a5021051efe95f0b08d/0_204_6855_4114/master/6855.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dbd20fbbb3be0d1e5f3aa5dc23315de","title":"don mccullin tate retrospective review","story":"Tate Britain, LondonThis retrospective of the veteran photographer’s images of war, poverty and atrocity shines light on the unconscionable. It’s almost overwhelmingHere is the camera that took a bullet instead of its owner. The military helmet and the light meter, passports and compass, all in a vitrine. Here is the American soldier, traumatised, staring back. Here are the villagers, displaced. Here are the living and here are the dead. Here are things I prefer not to describe.There are too many photographs in Don McCullin’s retrospective at Tate Britain. Room after room, on grey wall after grey wall, they keep on coming. These framed, mostly black and white images are a journey through the world and through the photographer’s life. Now 83, McCullin is a man who has seen too much and borne witness to too much. The too many and the too much are part of the point of this engrossing and demanding exhibition.“Yo lo vi” – I saw it – wrote Goya, beside an image of people fleeing before advancing French troops, in one of the prints in his Disasters of War suite of etchings, made around 200 years ago. “And this as well,” he wrote, beside the subsequent image. Goya’s declarations might not always tell the literal truth of what he saw with his own eyes, but no such doubts accompany McCullin’s photographs. He was there, as the Berlin Wall went up, on the streets of Limassol during the Cyprus civil war, in the Bogside and in Stanleyville, Biafra and Vietnam. He was there with the lone gunman, crouching alert on the floor of the wrecked lobby of the Holiday Inn in Beirut. He was there with the corpse of the Congolese man, his brains shot out beside his bicycle.He was also there when the woman, the very picture of a middle-class housewife, smiled back at his camera, as she was bundled away by the police at a Ban the Bomb protest at Aldermaston in the early 1960s. He also saw the homeless men asleep while standing, hands in pockets, heads lowered like horses, in Whitechapel in 1970. Disaster is so often close to home, in squalid rooms in Bradford, on East End doorsteps, in Toxteth and in Wigan.There are so many great and terrible images here. I snatch at fragments – the kid in the Finsbury park youth club, the gawping blokes with their beers in the stripper pub, the big northern woman queuing with a shiny new shovel in her hand, like the latest accessory. Small consolations and momentary pleasures, along with death and starvation, misery and fear, remind us of a different everyday. Fishermen kick a football about on a Scarborough beach, the sky about to open on a moment of sun. The metal mirror of a Somerset dew pond, round as a plate. A knobbly knees contest in Southend-on-Sea. Then we are back, staring at collapsed staircases, like exposed entrails, spilling from a bombed apartment block in Homs, Syria, and with a man dying of Aids in Zimbabwe.In these unrelenting scenes of trespass and tragedy we are left facing our own voyeurism, an increasing inability to process the mounting horrors. McCullin revisits his own work over and over again, as he prints and reprints his images in his darkroom, repeatedly trying to tease the best from his negatives. His returns to these images cannot be entirely healthy. Unless, that is, they inoculate him against their unconscionable power, both as images and as memories. The words “negatives” and “processing” have rarely felt so freighted.Many of McCullin’s photographs demand a long, strong look. Others we might want to swerve away from almost at the moment of recognition, only needing to see them once. They are already fixed in the developing fluid of the subconscious. Many of us of a certain age will have first encountered McCullin’s photographs by chance through the 1960s and 70s, in the Observer, in the Sunday Times Magazine. Many have been stirring around in my head for most of my life, irreducible and unforgettable.McCullin’s images brought the Vietnam war, starvation in Biafra, civil wars, post-colonial and nearer-to-home sectarian conflicts in Derry and Belfast, into our houses and into our heads in a way that television coverage never could.Sometimes McCullin had to walk away. Sometimes I had to walk away from certain images, too. After a few rooms, I had to take a break from the grieving and the corpses, the starving and the terrified. Our hunger for images may be insatiable, but it becomes hard to concentrate and to give each image, taken at who knows what cost, its due.There is a visceral quality to McCullin’s photographs, in their analogue tonalities, the depth of their blacks and greys, the clarities and dimming of their whites, their strong and weak light, their focus, their attendance on the unconscionable. His insistence on black and white seems to lend his photographs an extra veracity, a sullen, stark truthfulness, stripped of any glamour. McCullin did more than record, even though the situations in which he frequently found himself necessitated instantaneous responses, before the mind with its mortal fear and terror, disgust, moral outrage and doubt, empathy, self-justification, self hate, all the qualms, had a chance to kick in. Photography, he has said, chose him. The exhilaration of danger and the sound of gunfire found him, as much as he sought it out over his long career. Conflict was always round the corner for McCullin, even growing up in low-ceilinged rooms and poverty in Finsbury Park. Down the road, a man shepherds a flock to an abattoir through a grim north London dawn.Where the homeless stood around reeking fires of rubbish in Spitalfields market half a century ago, they sleep in corporate doorways now. The wars continue. There is no end to the poverty, nor to the atrocities. Looking away is not an option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92b04f825a1a5ee15009343d5fbebb41710d3cdb/0_84_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f7749ad8d7fab6080f8e1ff4b730ff","title":"coronet designed albert victoria star gallery queen jewellery","story":"Queen’s cherished possession among 80 new items to go on show in revamped jewellery galleryOne of Queen Victoria’s most cherished items of jewellery, a sapphire and diamond coronet designed by her husband Albert, is to be the star of a newly refurbished gallery at the museum that bears their name.The V\u0026ampA has announced details of plans for its William and Judith Bollinger jewellery gallery, due to reopen in April.The star of the show will be the coronet, going on permanent public display for the first time since it was acquired for the V\u0026ampA in 2017. The small crown was “the jewel of the young Queen” and shines fascinating light on the Victoria and Albert love story, says Richard Edgcumbe, the London museum’s curator of jewellery.“The story is fantastic – but even if it was not the Queen’s it would be a remarkable piece of work because it is so beautifully made. It is not a great fender of a thing, it is delicate … it flows through your hands like a piece of silk.”The coronet, he said, was incredibly flexible and “you can wiggle it and bend it to and fro” from being a small coronet to being a slightly wider tiara to being a full-scale bandeau.It was designed by Albert in 1840, the couple’s wedding year, and was made by Joseph Kitching, of Kitching and Abud, the Queen’s jewellers.In 1842, Victoria wore it in an important portrait of her by Franz Xaver Winterhalter, where, unconventionally, she had it on the back of her bobbed hair. The coronet was so important to Victoria that when in 1866, after five years of mourning Albert’s death, she felt she was up to opening parliament, she wore it instead of her crown.The coronet was passed down through the royal family, first to Edward VII and then George V and Queen Mary. They gifted it to their daughter Princess Mary, who can be seen wearing it in photographs. It was passed through her family until it was acquired most recently by an overseas private buyer.Because of its importance an export bar was placed on it by the government in 2016 to allow interested parties to match the £5m asking price. The Bollinger family came up with the money, an undisclosed sum, and gifted it to the nation.Its display at the V\u0026ampA was delayed to coincide with the refurbishment of the gallery, which is due to be completed by April.In total, 80 new items will join the William and Judith Bollinger gallery display. They include 49 art deco vanity cases collected by Freddie Mercury’s sister, Kashmira Cooke, and loaned to the museum in the singer’s memory with the prospect of it becoming a permanent gift."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cde2cb81340b9388a68eafcf502ce9d41ae763e2/12_460_1022_613/master/1022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6974478ee1df9ad7b78e60b6134ec636","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“Jesus, that was a dark and disturbing slice of French noir,” says Tom Mooney, who has been reading The Executioner Weeps by Frederic Dard:Daniel, a French artist, is on a break near Barcelona. Driving down a road one night, a young woman throws herself in front of his car in an apparent act of suicide. When he goes to the body, however, he realises she is still alive. Fearful of the consequences, he takes the girl back to his hotel. She awakes with severe amnesia, remembering nothing of her previous life. Daniel then becomes obsessed with her, instilling himself as her boyfriend and the central character in her new life. But, as he delves deeper into her forgotten past, he discovers the real, shocking reason she threw herself in front of his car.Grisly, grim and weaving from noir into horror, this is a very effective and highly creepy novel.Isabelle Leinster has been reading and “loving” Once Upon A River by Diane Setterfield:I have no connection to the River Thames but her description of the many stages of the river and the folk who live along its banks is captivating. The mystery of how a 4-year-old girl ended up in the river and was rescued and where she came from are central and I can’t wait to find out.“I saw somewhere that 2019 is the 50th anniversary of the first book in the Flashman series,” says RedmonT. “While I couldn’t care less about that, it did remind me how long it has been since I read them, so I’ve ed back in”:This morning, I finished the third in the series - Flash for Freedom - and am now about to start Flashman at the Charge. I think Royal Flash is by far the weakest of the series (though still brilliant) and Flashman and the Redskins the best. I urge you all to have a go at reading them if you haven’t already. As well as being extremely funny, they work as a highly entertaining history lesson - even down to the way people spoke in the mid-to-late nineteenth century2manyb00ks is enjoying The Lightning Men by Thomas Mullen, the second in the Darktown series:Crime fiction set in 1950 in Atlanta when African Americans have just joined the police force. The crime part is great but what is really interesting is how society is shifting and changing. The three main characters are well drawn and all making compromises between the law, their ethics and their families.Frontier by Can Xue has impressed Will1900:A vast, strangely ambiguous tale of people who find themselves in a dreamlike frontier town in China. Of all of her books, this one felt most like a collection of folk tales, run through with mysticism, and strange natural phenomena- for all its modernity it felt like discovering an ancient text.Yosserian has just finished Patrimony: A True Story, by Philip Roth:A memoir about his father, Herman Roth, and his death from a brain tumour. Roth has a straightforward way of telling the story of father and son, eschewing prose fireworks, as so far has all of his books I’ve read. It is poignant, and at times wryly funny. A commenter on Goodreads said that Roth showed how to be a good son. That despite Roth junior, or perhaps because of, being so keen to leave home and Roth senior, and establish his independence, he is able to loop back, and be there for his father later in life.Finally, a (beautifully written) confession by nosuchzone:I quite like being the last possible reader of a paperback - I bought the orange-banded Penguins that Margery Allingham wrote during wartime (it was a sudden interest) and, like the blitz-zones of London, Coventry, etc, they cracked at the spines, shedding pages, or clumps of them, as the reading progressed. The desiccated glue, that powders your fingers as you brush it’s scales aside, has a faintly seaweedy smell, I noticed. They’re still on a shelf, albeit lain flat (they wouldn’t hold together stood upright - ah, it comes to us all).Me, I buy second-hand cloth-bound hardcovers if I can and almost always throw the dust jackets away at once. What I like to read most is an old hardback that’s long lost it’s jacket, and has, at some point in its long life, been left skew-whiff on a pile near a window for a summer or two - so that the sun-bleaching of the cloth on the front cover is a rhomboid ghost-margin to its darker interior. Preferably in Trafalgar Blue, as it was called. It adds a spiritual dimension. Well, I find it does.You throw the dust jackets away?! Makes me wonder what else people do to their poor books.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

He’s also a Breton. So when he decided to leave his top ision team to join a small team based in Brittany for the 2018 season, most of his countrymen offered understanding Gallic nods. After all, cycling is in the blood of residents of this north-west region in France. Neighbouring Normandy isn’t far behind in its love of all things two-wheeled. And it’s little wonder – there are few areas better suited to exploration from the saddle.With hundreds of kilometres of voies vertes – greenways accessible only to those on two wheels, two feet, or a horse – there are plenty of options for families as well as Lycra-clad fanatics.Each of these routes is easily accessible from Cherbourg, Le Havre or Caen. So grab your bike, hop on the ferry, and get ready for some truly memorable cycling adventures.Cherbourg to Querqueville and back (nine miles14.5km)Best for: families looking for a safe and easy route to peddle.Highlights: stunning views out to sea.Start near La Cité de la Mer – Cherbourg’s maritime museum and well worth a visit – and take the cycle path alongside Boulevard de La Saline towards Querqueville. Enjoy the beach, and then head back the way you came.Ouistreham to Caen (10 miles16km)Best for: those who want to get on their bikes as soon as they get off the ferry.Highlights: the Musée Mémorial Pegasus commemorating the British soldiers of the 6th Airborne Division. Their capture of a bridge over the canal was a crucial strategic victory during the Normandy landings.This path is entirely along a signposted greenway, from Caen’s ferry port into the city itself, and will only take an hour or two to cover. It forms the opening portion of La Vélo Francette cycle route, which runs to La Rochelle.Caen to Bayeux via Juno beach and Arromanches (28.5 miles46km)Best for: the more confident cyclist, as much of the route is along shared roads.Highlights: arromanches 360° circular cinema, which tells the story of the Battle of Normandy.From Caen, take the cycle path north to Langrune-sur-Mer. Then head west along the coast towards Courseulles-sur-Mer, home to Juno beach on which Canadian forces landed during D-Day – a museum there commemorates their heroism. Then it’s the D112B south towards Crépon, then north towards Arromanches. From there, take the D87 to Bayeux – home to the famed 70 metre-long Bayeux Tapestry, and only seven miles away.Cherbourg to Carentan (34 miles55km)Best for: cyclists who are growing in confidence.Highlights: the wildlife-filled marshlands of the Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin.This is an established and well-signposted route, with no shortage of history along the way. It takes in the medieval cobbled town of La Haye-du-Puits and the châteaux ruins of Brix and Bricquebec.Ouistreham to Domfront (62 miles100km)Best for: confident cyclists, thanks to some steep sections.Highlights: the gorges of the Orne Valle, which offer multiple photo opportunities.This is the first full section of La Vélo Francette and offers its share of undulating terrain. From Caen it’s on to Thury-Harcourt, then the riverside village of Pont-d’Ouilly, Flers – home to a very pretty château – and finally on to historic Domfront, with its 11th-century castle.La Véloroute du Littoral de la Côte d’Albâtre: Le Havre to Le Tréport (about 100miles160km)Highlights: the stunning coastal views.This route follows the Alabaster Coast, with glorious views rewarding those confident enough to take on its undulations. It passes through Étretat – which provided inspiration for impressionist painters including Claude Monet – as well as Fécamp, home to a Benedictine abbey and a useful option for an overnight stay.Tour de Manche: Cherbourg to Roscoff (440miles708km)Best for: experienced riders who want a multi-stage adventure.Highlights: Mont St-Michel, Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin and the waterfalls in Mortain are all glorious.You may not quite be ready for the Tour de France, but how about the Tour de Manche, a cycling adventure that links France and England? This 754mile1200km circular route includes parts of Dorset and Devon, or try the French section running from Cherbourg to Roscoff. It is split into stages – Cherbourg to Carentan is the first portion, and uses quiet roads and greenways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac75f457503a87ad7074e8eaa2c2e0d74cb972c/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9005c36c281f0bd3f1514afc1e902cd","title":"the best food and where to find it in normandy and brittany","story":"Famed for their cider, cheese, seafood and charcuterie, Normandy and Brittany are two of France’s premier food regions. Foodies read on …MarketsAcross France, Normandy is esteemed for its abundance of quality produce and rich gastronomic history. Dozens of traditional markets showcase the best of these, with further specialist markets dedicated to fish, organic produce and local crafts. Whatever the day of the week, wherever you happen to be, you’ll never be far from one.Perhaps the most picturesque of these is to be found in the medieval “halles” in Dives-sur-Mer on a Monday. You can wander around the 14th-century half-timbered building, which is packed to bursting with stalls, and chat to dozens of local producers. Sundays in Trouville-sur-Mer are equally popular with locals and visitors looking for top-notch fresh bread, cheeses, meat and charcuterie – local farmers lay out their vegetables and homemade preserves, vinegar and pickles, too.In the surrounds of glamorous Deauville, regular gourmet food markets take place at Place du Marché (Tuesday, Friday, Saturday) and the abundant high-end restaurants and Parisian-style cafes are ripe for celeb-spotting during Deauville’s American film festival in September. If poisson is your passion, Trouville, the adjacent 17th-century port town, boasts a daily market on the quay with numerous terrace cafes and grills for feasting on seafood.Rouen and the Seine valley are renowned for the quality of their markets. For cheeses, fish and seafood, and local specialities such as pressed duck, check out Clos Saint-Marc (Saturday), Vieux-Marché (Sun-Fri and brocante or flea market on Saturday) and les Emmurées (Tuesday, Saturday) and the 250-stall Sotteville-les-Rouen (Thursday, Sunday).Regional specialities and where to sample themDairy herds were introduced to Normandy by the Vikings and the region has long produced world-class cheeses for the Paris market. You can buy camembert, Livarot, Pont-l’Evêque and Neufchâtel in shops and supermarkets, but to try small-batch artisan cheeses, head for the markets and specialist fromageries – notably in the Pays d’Auge and smaller Le Pays de Bray regions. At Isigny sur Mer, west of Caen, you can also enjoy a tour and tasting at Sainte Mére cheese factory.As you’d expect, the coastal towns and villages are awash with fabulous fish and seafood. Inland, look out for exceptional beef and veal, and the duck – canard de Rouen – appears on lots of menus.If you’ve a sweet tooth, don’t visit the region without trying a traditional tarte Normande, a rich shortcrust pastry tart filled with creamy egg custard and almonds, and topped with slices of caramelised apple. RestaurantsSmart, family-friendly eateries serving simple, seasonal produce are plentiful in Normandy. For fresh “surf and turf” with a sensational sea view, Hôtel des Isles in Barneville-Carteret, just south of Cherbourg, offers a land and sea starter buffet with seafood platters, grilled or plancha-seared fish and traditional stewed meats for main.If you’re after a traditional experience inland, try Brasserie Paul in Rouen where fresh regional specialities such as rabbit pâté, Normandy snails, local farm chicken and fine cheeses are on the menu.Rouen also offers stylish two-Michelin-starred dining at Gill – pigeon is a speciality – or the more affordable but still sleekly decorated sister restaurant, Gill Côté Bistro.DrinkingCalvados (apple brandies) and cider are the region’s two signature drinks. Three controlled appellations produce the former, one of which is Pays d’Auge, where copper alembic pot stills are used. On the 25-mile (40km) cider route east of Caen, you can visit more than 20 establishments producing one or both of these, as well as pommeau – made by mixing apple juice with brandy. Many of the distilleries and cidermakers occupy picture-postcard houses set amid apple orchards and lush pastures.MarketsFrom the bustling Sunday market at Carnac to Vannes’s fish market (four days a week, as well as a traditional market on Wednesdays) to the astonishing 20 neighbourhood markets that are spread around Rennes, Brittany is a region brimming with food and produce, crafts and culture. Whether you’re looking for crisp apples and freshly picked strawberries or more gastro items such as rare poultry and artisanal butters, you’ll find them on a stall – Breton chefs do their shopping here … and they know a thing or two.At charming Pontivy, by the river Blavet and the Nantes-to-Brest canal, you can drop in at the Monday market before exploring the medieval castle and the maze of winding streets. The town also has a thriving antiques trade and there are regular flea markets.Quaint Bécherel, between Saint-Malo and Rennes, has a buzzing Saturday food and household goods market and is also one of France’s best-loved book towns. There are more than a dozen bookshops, a book market on the first Sunday of the month and a lively schedule of literary events, including a fête du livre (book fair) every Easter.In the summer months, you can find night markets in Carnac and Quiberon, and enjoy classic Breton musical entertainment with bombarde (woodwind) players while you browse.Regional specialities and where to sample themIf you’re self-catering in Brittany you’re in luck. With 1,740 miles of coastline, you can pick up some of the best fish and shellfish in Europe. Brittany is the powerhouse of France’s oyster trade, providing one-third of the nation’s yield – Cancale is its capital. Look out, too, for delicious mussels, scallops, clams, lobster, and langoustines, as well as more exotic items such as organic abalones.Breton producers are very proud of their pork – saucissons of all kinds abound, while audouille – a sausage made from smoked chitterling – has its semi-official capital in Guéméné-sur-Scorff. Across the region, look out for local onions and organic honey.If you’re big on pastry, kouign amann – which translates as “butter cake” – is a Breton speciality.

It is time for bookmakers and gambling operators to put the vulnerable, customers and staff ahead of cold hearted profit.”According to comments on an internal Ladbrokes Coral message board, shared with the  by an anonymous staff member, many employees are unhappy that they are to be judged on encouraging gamblers to set up online accounts.Other employees pointed out that staff who work in busy shops with a lot of passing trade might be at an advantage when it comes to signing customers up to online accounts.In the memo to staff, Ladbrokes said it would not take any decision on which shops to close until it had finished a 45-day period of “collective consultation”.No dismissals will happen before 1 May, within days of legislation coming into force that cuts the maximum stake on FOBTs from £100 to £2, effectively rendering them uneconomic.While some staff will be made redundant, others will have their contracts reduced to 36 hours a week.A Ladbrokes spokesperson said shop closures were “an inevitable outcome of the changes to FOBT regulation”.“We are fully committed to running a fair and transparent consultation process with our shop colleagues. Given the regulatory environment, our aim is to keep the maximum number of shops open, job losses to a minimum, and to continue to build a responsible and vibrant multi-channel environment in our shops where customers can transact with us seamlessly in our shops or online.”Betting shop trade union Community said the cuts would be “deeply worrying” for Ladbrokes employees, adding that front line staff should not bear the brunt of the impact.“The company’s consultation document has caused real concern among our members, with many believing that decisions have already been made to target those workers in betting shops outside the city centres,” said operations director Tom Blenkinsop.“Ladbrokes must immediately engage with Community, the union for betting shop workers, to see if an alternative plan can be found to avoid job losses. The government also has a role to play, and must look at what support they can offer to workers whose jobs are at risk as an unintended consequence of changes to the law.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3075585869bb90cf569a4388fc10348b872f59ce/147_84_1757_1053/master/1757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aef9c696483c33cb068bf32dfd126ead","title":"statue margaret thatcher cue vandals","story":"Place an obstacle in the path and many people will seek to overcome it. Urban planners build footpaths, pedestrians forge their own desire lines. Hanging a “Do not climb” plaque is often a psychological incentive for people to clamber on to the forbidden edifice. This aspect of human nature should have occurred to the people behind the proposed installation of an enormous Margaret Thatcher statue in her home town, Grantham, in Lincolnshire. In order to prevent the statue being besieged by vandals, it will have to stand atop a three-metre (10ft) plinth.Creative critics of Thatcher’s legacy have already proposed workarounds: paintball target practice, hammer-throwing competitions, and the simple but trusty ladder. The depth of antipathy to the former prime minister means no matter what is built in her honour, it will draw vandals and dissenters. Knowing in advance that a statue commemorating her is likely to be defaced immediately, it is mystifying to insist on erecting it at all. Thatcher’s legacy remains with us today, and is still comfortably within living memory: that history, therefore, is still contested and fought over. Her fans and critics are embroiled in a battle to have their perspective recognised and recorded in history’s narrative.The inevitable vandalism will accurately reflect a toxic political legacy: the UK has long been cleaved by a social and class ide. Traditionally, the Conservatives have represented the interests of the ruling class and elite, and Labour the working class and more vulnerable. That two camps have such ergent views on the leader of one party is hardly a surprise. It is very likely that a statue of Tony Blair would also be immediately emblazoned with a spray-painted reference to war crimes for his role in the Iraq war. Freedom of expression isn’t always entirely polite, because feelings and emotions run deep, especially when people’s communities, livelihoods and loved ones have been jeopardised or harmed by the policies of these iniduals and their parties. Some councils operate a 10-year rule, to allow “passions to cool” before erecting a statue. Nonetheless, just this Monday Karl Marx’s memorial in Highgate cemetery was found vandalised.Perhaps statues have had their day. London in particular seems haunted by dark, metal figures of long-dead men, most with deep involvement in the bloody British colonial project, high-up roles in short wars, or simply the great fortune to be born into wealthy families. What do they teach us about history? Practically nothing. Barely anyone searches the background of a statue commemorating some man they’ve never heard of. These shadowy figures exist mostly to maintain the dominance of an inidual’s memory posthumously, or are erected in exchange for sizable bequests.Public sentiment around statues appears to be shifting. In 2018 a statue of Thatcher was rejected by Westminster council, despite being fitted with a hard-to-climb plinth and integral sockets for scaffolding to protect it during protests. The #RhodesMustFall movements in South Africa and Oxford, in the UK, forced some uncomfortable conversations about the degree to which colonial history is embedded in the architectural landscape of many institutions. Even when statues are not politically sensitive, they are not always welcome additions to the cultural landscape. The flat-out ridicule levelled at one of Cristiano Ronaldo, and another of Victoria Wood, shows the perils of trying to honour people in such a form: commemoration via statue can be high risk when capturing a likeness is the only point of the metal lump.Statues are only one way to tell us about history, and not even a good one. Murals, plaques marking important events, and public photographic exhibitions are more informative. History deserves to be in the public space and debated in the public realm. Growing up, I learned much about local history from murals commemorating the Chartist uprising and immediate murderous suppression of protestors in Newport, and a huge amount from almost every gable wall in Belfast. A statue of a prime minister has never taught me anything, bar the fact that too many of these people looked the same.If statues continue to play a part in public life, expect the public to engage with them, and not always with respect. In parliament, a bust of Oliver Cromwell was recently fitted with sensors after one or more MPs constantly turned it to face the wall in retaliation for his actions in Ireland. If Thatcher is hoisted atop a 10ft plinth, expect her to receive similar treatment. The will to vandalise her likeness is as much a part of the contestation of history as the right to leave her a bouquet of flowers.• Dawn Foster is a  columnist who writes on politics, social affairs and economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd453665de51381ba0da8b57a8a972803ff43237/0_91_5195_3118/master/5195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=003b536eabaa29066fda7b1eb8b59a98","title":"the guardian view on brexit and ireland the forging of folly","story":"Brexit is about drawing lines on maps and hearts. In that respect it is at odds with the 1998 Good Friday agreement which sought to erase them. Key to ending the Troubles was the removal of the hard border between the north and south of Ireland. Theresa May’s problem is that she has committed to leaving the European Union while respecting the peace deal that depended on both London and Dublin being part of it. The agreement made less salient the questions of identity: under its provisions people in Northern Ireland could be, uncontroversially, citizens of Britain or Ireland. What did it matter if they were part of a club that allowed people to travel, work and reside anywhere? North-south institutions were set up to oversee common endeavours. The agreement was sold as a “stepping stone to a united Ireland” to republicans, while unionists held that it was “securing the union”. The symbolism was key: with a hard border you can see that the island is partitioned, without it you cannot.Aware of this, London and Dublin committed not to return to the days of border checkpoints, which would risk undermining the peace deal’s principles. Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement enshrines this in law in the form of an insurance policy: to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal, there would be a backstop arrangement to allow for frictionless trade. Fanatical rightwing anti-EU Tory MPs were not bothered about the peace process, or the aspirations of fellow subjects. Instead, they saw in the insurance policy a devious mechanism to force Britain to march in lockstep with EU regulations that hard Brexiters were desperate to get out of. To reverse her government’s historic Commons defeat, Mrs May voted to replace the backstop. She did so to win over the Democratic Unionist party, but her actions enraged businesses in Northern Ireland which had publicly backed her deal.In Belfast on Tuesday, the prime minister was back to the push-me-pull-you politics of Brexit. She signalled that, rather than the “alternative arrangements” to the backstop floated previously, she was edging towards an insurance policy that could either be time-limited or allow for a unilateral withdrawal. The prime minister may have said more than she intended, as a group of her MPs considering “alternative arrangements” were meeting in London as she spoke. Neither of Mrs May’s offers seem possible in a strictly legal sense, but both could be rendered in political terms. Almost everyone agrees that the backstop must be a temporary measure, but no one wants to say so in law. On such anvils, political follies can be forged. Mrs May’s problem stems from the fact that the only Northern Ireland party represented in the Commons is the DUP. The party’s role in itself undermines a core principle of the Good Friday agreement, that the position of the British government would be “neutral” – it had no selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland and would accept the unification of Ireland by consent. The DUP-Conservative pact, a result of the 2017 election, calls this aspect into question. The DUP represents only a third of votes cast in 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9b891d65766e563bd0c47db63ad6b3ee79e741b/120_0_2380_1428/master/2380.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b19513be987b1eb8932d40c7448cbc8","title":"uk right youth group us turning point","story":"As political launches go, it fish-tailed, rather than flew. Amid a raft of endorsements from conservative and reactionary figures, Turning Point UK, a local offshoot of an American conservative youth movement, hit social media with all the grace of a pigeon slamming into a plate-glass window. Instead of a brave bunch of plucky young Britons ready to crowbar free the stranglehold the left supposedly has on UK youth, our heroes were subjected to a sustained shower of ridicule the likes of which hasn’t been seen on Twitter for, well, at least a fortnight.Turning Point UK says it aims to challenge the idea that young people are inherently left-leaning, and seeks to fight against “socialism, racism and identity politics”. But recommendations from such reactionary “bad boys” as Infowars’ Paul Joseph Watson, Breitbart’s James Delingpole and Westminster’s Michael Heaver weren’t enough to drown out the ridicule. Nor were the endorsements from Tory right MPs such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, Ben Bradley, Priti Patel, Chris Green and Steve Baker, among others. The wisecracks – particularly about star recruit Darren Grimes, who is still looking at a £20,000 fine from the Electoral Commission – simply wrote themselves.Yet among the jollity and really rather funny Twitter parodies, there are rather worrying aspects of Turning Point’s work in the United States that bear some consideration, and have ramifications for its UK incarnation.Turning Point USA (TPUSA) was founded in 2012 by Illinois college student Charlie Kirk as a supposed antidote to the “scourge” of liberal thought overwhelming American campuses.Over the course of a string of Fox News appearances, during which Kirk railed against campus leftists, the supposed oppression of conservative thought, and the conservative talking points of the day, the operating budget of the group skyrocketed from around $50,000 in 2012 to approximately $8,000,000 in 2016.It should surprise nobody that careful examination of tax filings by outlets such as the Daily Beast revealed that some TPUSA funding came from industry interests, such as mining and petroleum companies. Nor should it be any great shock that a number of shadowy thinktanks, with a stated libertarian or far-right agenda, have contributed to the group. It is “astroturf” – a front for various interests that wish to remain hidden, and one that has almost continuously been involved in controversy.Since its inception, TPUSA has been making headlines for supposed racist and sexist statements, for making misleading statements, and for having very little transparency in its day-to-day running.TPUSA’s director of communications, Candace Owens, for example, has regularly drawn ire over her mockery of the #MeToo movement, describing survivors as “weak”, while founder Kirk has been caught in a string of mistruths – most recently, that gilets jaunes protesters in France were chanting “we want Trump!”. All the while, the organisation resists requests to reveal the entirety of its donors.As the UK draws closer to Brexit, whose interests will Turning Point UK – which describes itself as a “student movement for free markets, limited government and personal responsibility” – be representing? Will they be attacking state schools, social services, the NHS? The odds are good, just as much as the goods are odd. Yet there is one more aspect of TPUSA’s operations that provokes concern.Perhaps the centrepiece of Kirk’s TPUSA, and the project that made the most headlines, was “Professor Watchlist”, a website on which students could “name and shame” academics, listing their supposed transgressions against students with a conservative mindset. If that sounds rather sinister, that’s because it is. Policing academia has long been a tool of authoritarians, particularly fascists. For an outfit that supposedly prides itself on its focus on liberty and opportunity, a website enabling students to inform on their teachers does seem rather off-brand. In fact, it appears downright insidious.With Turning Point UK seeking to fill the same position within UK universities as its American branch, how long will it be before a similar British website appears, seeking submissions from those aggrieved by their teachers? What protections will academics have, and how will the information be used? Jokes aside, the arrival of Turning Point UK is cause for concern.• Mike Stuchbery is a writer and historian"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b542e7713dcec1dad1aa276f1f130813cfb156/0_0_941_574/master/941.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=666d7a00e902b3411f6266651b753bd2 1400w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of pleasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘pleasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘pleasure’.Share your photos of what pleasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 6 February at 10am.

The British Fashion Council has partnered with China’s largest retailer, JD, since 2017 to help introduce British designers to the lucrative market as well as fund its annual Vogue and GQ prizes. Its partner and supporter, the Value Retail-owned outlet Bicester Village, is also more than aware of the numbers.Lau has selected an edit from the brands Huishan Zhang, Ryan Lo, Anais Jourden, Mukzin, I Am Chen, Marie Yat, Xu Zhi, Matter Matter, Yang Li and Snow Xue Gao to showcase in the shop. Not all designers hail from China, some have Chinese heritage and have grown up and studied elsewhere. They are all names that Lau has been tracking for a while.“There has never been a better time to show off beautiful, slightly lesser known fashion brands as the increasing appetite for ‘newness’ is omnipresent,” says the Bicester Village business director John Durnin. “We have always been keen to nurture up-and-coming talent, offering these young designers a platform to showcase their collections to a UK and global audience, introducing them to new customers from around the world.”Following its official launch, the pop-up is already off to a good start, with Lau’s edit offering something different to what else is on offer at Bicester, she says.“It’s a great platform for those designers – the people that are coming in know their stuff and are very discerning.

Here’s a sharp, fruity version of the Chinese favouriteSweet and sour pork is a dish with a reputation problem one of the first Chinese foods many Britons will try, sugary and deep-fried, it’s a guaranteed crowdpleaser often wrongly dismissed as westernised junk. Prepared with care, however, and tailored to your own palate, sweet and sour pork – or, indeed, chicken, fish or tofu – can be as delicious as the first time you tasted it.Though this flavour combination is common throughout China, often in the form of a dipping sauce, like many British favourites, the version we know best comes from Guangzhou, and is a staple of the bright and noisy Hong Kong diner – though its fame has spread worldwide for the very simple reason that it hits all the right notes, wherever you are. Savoury and crunchy, sweet and tangy: it’s addictive stuff. Treat with caution.Though it can be tailored to just about any protein you like, I think the juicy texture of pork works particularly well in this dish and, according to YouTubers Steph and Chris of Chinese Cooking Demystified, “older variants… use pork belly instead of loin. At most restaurants nowadays, you’ll see this with lean meat, though, and we do prefer it here.” I’m inclined to agree: the edge of the fat on the pork belly used by Yan-Kit So in her Classic Chinese Cookbook goes deliciously crisp in the fryer, but the rest becomes annoyingly chewy belly is a cut better slow cooked.To my surprise, however, the spare ribs used in Kei Lum and Diora Fong Chan’s China: The Cookbook work much better, the meat remaining soft and juicy, while the bony bits are little more than vehicles for batter. Some of my testers find them a bit fiddly, however, so I’m going to stick with loin, though I would urge anyone who doesn’t mind getting up close and personal with some bones to give them a try (get your butcher to chop them up first they’re pretty hard on the old cleaver).Cut the meat nice and small Anglo-Chinese food writer Lizzie Mabbott muses: “I would go with pork shoulder strips. Chunks seem only appropriate for chicken, but I can’t explain why.” Having chewed my way through the great Ken Hom’s mighty 5cm cubes of fatty pork neck, I can explain why: chicken is a softer meat, pork has more heft to it.Loin might not need much in the way of tenderising, but a brief marinade will always add flavour we particularly like the garlicky soy mixture used by Amy and Julie Zhang in their Dumpling Sisters Cookbook. I don’t think you need to add any sugar at this point, because the sauce will be sweet anyway, but testers do enjoy the warmth of Chinese five spice in the recipe in Charmaine Solomon’s Complete Asian Cookbook.Slimmers stop reading now: though you can find recipes, like that from Ching He Huang, which simply stir-fry the meat, this is not health food – most sweet and sour pork is deep-fried, often doubly so, to make it “very crisp”, as Solomon puts it. You could skip the initial fry and blanch the pork first instead, as the Zhangs suggest, but that’s a bit of a faff, and I think has a tendency to make the meat slightly tough. Plus it means another pan to wash up.The protein is a movable feast, however you could probably even make this dish from battered Mars bars if you wanted, because the important thing is the sauce. Chef Jeremy Pang of School of Wok writes in his book Chinese Unchopped: “In the old days (way before the internet), sweet and sour was not red in colour at all, as it was predominantly made up of vinegar, sugar and dark soy sauce. However, with the heavy influence western culture now has, the Cantonese have found that ketchup provides the perfect balance and wrapping consistency for this dish. Who’s to say this recipe upgrade isn’t just as authentic as the old ways? As with any culture as it changes and adapts, it doesn’t make its expressions any less authentic it just makes them a product of the times.”They concede, however, that “if you don’t feel like screwing around with these fruit pastes, obviously don’t hesitate to reach for the ketchup. Basically every restaurant in Guangdong uses it, the vast majority of families use it … it’s absolutely an authentic addition to the dish.” I try a dollop of trusty Heinz in the Zhangs, So and Solomon’s recipes, and find that, when mixed with extra vinegar and sugar, it does indeed produce a sauce very close to the stuff I remember from restaurants – though not, it must be noted, quite as sweet and orange and gloopy as the glorious “proper sweet and sour sauce, like you get from a takeaway” made by chefs Chin and Choo Ziang using distilled malt vinegar and orange squash – “if you’ve ever wondered what that flavour is you can’t quite grasp, it’s orange squash”.Ken Hom, meanwhile, uses fresh orange juice, and So puts in pineapple juice – the extra citrussy tang of all of the versions using fruit prove more popular than the tasty but somewhat one-dimensional ketchup-only recipes, but most popular of all is the jam mixture, which has a fruity depth to it that the others lack, with a distinct berry sharpness from the cranberries. As I don’t have a particularly sweet tooth, I’m going to cut back on the sugar slightly (soft light brown makes a decent substitute for palm sugar here) – though feel free to adjust to your taste – and add a dash of soy sauce and Hom’s red rather than white vinegar, to help balance the potentially cloying sweet and sour flavours.Once you’re happy with the flavour, you’ll need to thicken it: both cornflour and potato starch work fine for this purpose.Many sweet and sour recipes are very simple indeed: Hom’s contains just shallots in the way of vegetable matter, and the Zhangs stick with the classic pineapple flavoured with ginger and garlic, but I think it’s far more interesting with a few other contrasting flavours and textures. I try spring onions, peas and water chestnuts, but come back to the traditional onion and green pepper pairing favoured by So, with extra pineapple – because, let’s be honest, it’s delicious – plus a sprinkling of Steph and Chris’s mild red chilli for warmth and colour. Use whatever you like, but just make sure you cut it fairly small so it stir-fries evenly.200g pork loin or lean shoulder1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tbsp rice wine or dry sherry½ tsp salt¼ tsp Chinese five-spice powder (optional)To cook1 onion1 green pepper1 mild red chilli1 egg60g cornflour, plus extra to coatVegetable oil, to fry100g pineapple chunksFor the sauce2 tbsp apricot jam – the lower in sugar, the better1 tbsp cranberry sauce, ditto1 good squeeze lemon or lime juice25-40g soft light brown sugar2.5 tbsp Chinese red vinegar (ideally), or rice vinegar1 tbsp light soy sauce1 tsp cornflourServe with egg fried rice and probably something fresh and greenCut the pork into strips about 1cm wide.

The League Two club’s romance with the FA Cup continued as they overcame Middlesbrough at a rain-soaked Rodney Parade to tee up a dream fifth-round date with Manchester City.But the goalkeeper, Joe Day, had other things on his mind at the final whistle. As Newport’s players basked in perhaps their finest hour, the club reaching the fifth round for the first time since 1948-49, Day sprinted down the tunnel in order to get to hospital, with his wife, Lizzie, having gone into labour with twins.As for Willmott, the winger has the kind of backstory that belongs to the Cup, given he was stacking shelves in Tesco two years ago, rejoining Newport to help retain their league status last year. It was the perfect Cup tie, one that had all the ingredients for an upset from the moment the rain started lashing down. Willmott’s thumping effort from 25 yards earned Newport – mid-table in the fourth tier – the lead before Padraig Amond doubled the advantage.Flynn said he gave the prospect of entertaining the Premier League champions little thought, citing the Bullseye gameshow and how his players could have ended up with a consolation prize akin to a rubber dinghy. But instead their reward after a deserved victory in which they outclassed a Championship side chasing promotion is a date with Pep Guardiola and co.The gulf between the teams is huge City’s most recent starting XI cost £470m, Newport’s a mere £50,000. Still, “Manchester City, we’re coming for you” was the chorus that reverberated around a rocking sold-out stadium at the final whistle.Whatever the result here, there was always going to be cause for celebration given that both Flynn and Tony Pulis are sons of Pillgwenlly, a district of the city on the other side of the river Usk. It was Matt Dolan, a former Middlesbrough trainee, who forced the replay 10 days earlier, meaning Pulis – who has managed in excess of 1,000 matches – faced Newport in the city where he grew up for the first time.Dolan again began on the bench against Boro, who made five changes from their league win at West Brom last weekend. The lashing rain made life interesting on a pitch that is also home to two rugby union sides, Newport RFC and the Gwent-Dragons, with this the 59th match to take place here this season.Newport were unfazed by the growing pool of surface water, making a barnstorming start, and Boro were, by contrast, stuck in the mud. The referee, Stuart Attwell, should have awarded the home side an early penalty too, but he waved away appeals when Adam Clayton handballed a cross into the box by Regan Poole.Somehow, though, Boro headed down the tunnel at the interval with the score goalless. Pulis introduced Rajiv van La Parra thereafter but before the winger even had time to get his bearings, Newport finally had the ball in the net.Willmott charged towards the opposition box from deep with Amond for company – though the winger did not need him. Willmott dropped his shoulder to buy himself another yard of space as Boro backed off, with his swerving shot eluding the 40-year-old Dimi Konstantopoulos, who could only get a weak right hand to it. Newport were deservedly in front, Boro in trouble – and still to register a shot on target – prompting Pulis to throw on Rudy Gestede and Ashley Fletcher.But as the rain continued to lash down, things went from bad to worse for Boro when Newport doubled their lead after 67 minutes. The visitors were bamboozled by a training-ground corner routine, with Amond darting to the front post to bury Willmott’s inswinging ball. Boro’s players looked at one another for answers as Amond ran off, sparking delirium among the home fans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb42abd50dbfc0f72e24b4213cfa2b073e19ed81/0_149_4132_2480/master/4132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b837de7e0ca44c8bf237cd35c435c970","title":"pep guardiola insists manchester city remain calm title run in football","story":"• Champions will return to top with win over Everton• City’s goal difference is five better than that of rivals LiverpoolPep Guardiola has urged Manchester City to score as many goals as possible in the knowledge that it could decide the title race. City will regain top spot from Liverpool on Wednesday night on goal difference if they win at Everton, albeit having played a game more, and Guardiola knows the margin could be slim in the final analysis.His team’s goal difference is five better than Liverpool’s and superior to Tottenham’s by 14. Roberto Mancini’s City side won the title on goal difference from Manchester United in 2012.“The first message is to win the game and the second one is if you can score, score, and if you can avoid conceding, do it,” Guardiola said.Liverpool’s last two results have been draws, Jürgen Klopp’s team spurning the chance to pull seven points ahead of City.“Three or four days ago we were already done, the champions were Liverpool and now we can be leading.

I have made a decision,” Hazard told the French radio station RMC, although he did not elaborate.The interview was recorded two months ago as part of a documentary about his career, but it was only released this week and may colour the context of the guessing games that have continued to follow Hazard’s every move.Uncertainty over the 28-year-old Belgian’s plans has been an unwelcome undercurrent to Chelsea’s season. Hazard has publicly admitted being torn between staying at Stamford Bridge and the “dream” switch to Real, a club he referred to in October as “the best club in the world”. The manager, Maurizio Sarri, said in December that it was “time to decide” the issue but also accepts that his star player should leave if that is his wish. “If he wants to go, he has to go,” Sarri said last week.The situation is particularly pressing given Hazard’s contract expires in June 2020 and he is yet to entertain new terms. If Real and Hazard are both amenable to a deal then Chelsea are unlikely to stand in his way, although it could take a nine-figure bid to seal his departure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8edbec5d3cfcd17640f5c5c5b2bf41f3b505a105/0_127_3344_2007/master/3344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1ec9ae574d7da5f83f0b09adfa5de1c","title":"fa cup fourth round replays newport v middlesbrough and more live","story":" Saïd Benrahma was the standout player as Brentford saw off the challenge of plucky non-League upstarts Barnet. Ed Aarons was there. Ivan Cavaleiro scored the odd goal of five as Wolves finally got the better of Shrewsbury Town. Paul Wilson was there. Ben Fisher braved the rain at Rodney Parade to see Newport book a fifth round tie at home to the Premier League champions.League One strugglers Shrewsbury Town did themselves proud at Molineux, but the class and quality of Wolves saw them through to the fifth round. Matt Doherty scored two and created a third, to earn his side a trip to Bristol City. Barnet’s whiteknuckle FA Cup run is over, while Brentford have earned themselves a trip to play Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium.They’re still playing at Griffin Park and Molineux. Brentford are 3-1 ahead against Barnet, while Wolves are hanging in there against Shrewsbury with three minutes of added time to play. It’s Wolves 3-2 Shrewsbury. More good news from Joe Day: Joe Day, who missed the first game against Boro because his wife was due to give birth to twins, ran straight down the tunnel at the final whistle. While the kids decided to stay put that time, Mrs Day has apparently gone into labour during this game and Joe is rushing off to the hospital to be with her. Here’s hoping he has time to grab a quick shower before he gets to the maternity ward. Steve McClaren’s Championship side saw off League One opposition in Portsmouth courtesy of goals from Nahki Wells and Matt Smith. They will host Watford in the next round. Sensational goals from Robbie Willmott and Padriag Ammond won the replay for Newport, who will entertain Premier League champions Manchester City in the fifth round. Deep into added time at Rodney Parade: Newport’s fans are singing in the rain as their heroes run down the clock out on the quagmire that is the football match. They’ve humbled Middlesbrough tonight and on the touchline, Tony Pulis is looking very displeased indeed. Newport County made the thick end of £1m from their Cup run last season and look set to earn even more tonight. Back at Rodney Parade: Considering the conditions they have had to deal with – torrential rain and a cut-up morass of a pitch – Newport’s performance against Middlesbrough tonight has been outstanding. They have bossed a team from two isions above them for 81 minutes tonight, lead by two goals and could conceivably five or six goals ahead. Their defence has been stout and obdurate, while going forward they have been outstanding. Robbie Willmott has been outstanding, scoring a wonderful solo goal, while getting ball after ball into the penalty area. Up front, Jamille Matt and Padriag AMond have also been excellent. Remember, their reward for winning this game, assuming they hang on, will be a televised home tie against Manchester City. Non-league Barnet grab themselves a lifeline at Griffin Park courtesy of David Tutonda. Brentford increase their lead and all but guarantee themselves a fifth round tie against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. Ivan Cavaleiro gives Wolves the lead by the odd goal of five, shooting low past Steve Arnold after being released by Matt Doherty and cutting inside. QPR’s superiority eventually yields idends as Nahki Wells fires them ahead against Portsmouth. It’s a scruffy goal from a corner, but they all count and he won’t mind. Newport double their lead as they continue to pile the hurt on Middlesbrough. It’s a brilliant goal from a set piece, with Padraig Ammond sprinting from back to a pocket of space at the front stick to turn on a sixpence and volley home the delivery from Robbie Willmott. A trademark Teddy Sheringham move, it was a brilliant delivery and a brilliant finish. There are over 20 minutes left, but Newport already look home and hosed, such has been their dominance. Another substitution for Middlesbrough: Britt Assombalonga is forced off with an injury and is replaced by Ashley Fletcher. Boro have lost both their forwards, which will not help their cause. The still trail by the only goal of the game. Meanwhile at Loftus Road: It remains scoreless between QPR and Portsmouth, but Nahki Wells and Massimo Luongo have both gone close for the home side, who are dominating their opposition from League One. A substitution at Rodney Parade: Middesbrough Jordan Hugill limps off with some manner of injury and is replaced by Rudy Gestede, whose existence, I must confess, I had completely forgotten about. Sorry Rudy. This just in from our man at Griffin Park ... This just in from Wolves v Shrewsbury Town: The half-time proposal takes big stones ... and not just the ones on the engagement ring. Luckily, this chap wasn’t humiliated in front of a full house at Molineux. Newport County take the lead and it’s no more than they deserve after dominating throughout the first half. Robbie Willmott picked up the ball in midfield and bore down on the Middlesbrough penalty area with the defence back-pedalling. Ignoring a run from Padraig Amond, he drops his shoulder and unleashes a shot from the edge of the area. In the Middlesbrough goal, Dimi got a hand to the ball but was unable to keep it out. Newport lead 1-0 at Rodney Parade. Matt Doherty scores his second of the night, heading Wolves level against Shrewsbury at Molineux. League One outfit Shrewsbury have come from behind to take the lead at Molineux. It’s a gaffe from John Ruddy, one of the fringe players brought in by Nuno tonight, that gifts the Shrews the lead. Josh Laurent took a speculative long range shot which the goalkeeper spilled and allowed to trickle over the line. Laurent’s celebrations bordered on the sheepish, but those of the travelling Shrewsbury fans did not. Newport go close again: Robbie Wilmott is sending cross after cross into the Middlesbrough box, wreaking havoc in the process. His latest finds the head of Jamille Matt, who sends a header looping over the bar and onto the roof of the net. It remains 0-0 with four minutes of the half remaining. At Griffin Park, Julian Jeanvier has doubled Brentford’s lead in a match which they’re completely dominating. A Said Benrahma free-kick was curled in from deep and the defender fired home past Mark Cousins. How are Newport not winning? Getting on the end of a cross of a Robbie Willmott cross, Padriag Amond blindsides his marker and sends a bullet header from nine or 10 yards straight at Middlesbrough’s goalkeeper. It was a fairly straightforward save in the end, but Amond really should have scored. Newport are completely bossing this game and should be three or four up by now. Tony Pulis hands a note to Adam Clayton: It seems to be quite a long one, written on a piece of A5 paper. It takes Clayton almost a minute to unfold and read, before he folds it up and tucks it into his sock. I have no idea what it says, but I’m guessing it’s something along the lines of “You’re getting hammered by a team from League Two, managed by somebody who went to the same school as me. I was born and reared near here, so if you don’t pull your fingers out, I will be embarrassed and you and your team-mates will be running laps all day tomorrow.”Newport go close again: Jamille Matt leaps to try to get his head on a long ball from deep sent into the Boro penlaty area by Regan Poole. He fails to make contact and the ball drops by the far post, where Joss Labadie is following up, but fails to head home. With a little more savvy, he had a very straightforward tap-in there. There are 28 minutes gone at Rodney Parade and it’s still scoreless, but Newport are on top. QPR 0-0 Portsmouth: QPR are on top at Loftus Road, where both Luke Freeman and Massimo Luongo have both shot wide. Newport County 0-0 Middlesbrough: Padriag Amond brings a smart save out of Boro goalkeeper Dimi, volleying into the Greek’s face and winning a corner from five or six yards. Shrewsbury equalise at Molineux, recovering from their early setback. Unmarked at a corner, James Bolton buries a powerful header after getting on the end of Oliver Norburn’s corner. Middlesbrough go close: Jordfan Hugill hits the outside of the foot of the left upright with a low drive from distance. There are 17 minutes gone at Rodney Parade, where it remains scoreless and very wet. Back at Rodney Parade: It remains scoreless between Newport County and Boro, but the League Two side have been denied a penalty after Adam Clayton handled in his own penalty area. The Middlesbrough midfielder foolishley and deliberately controlled a ball into the box with his arm, but referee Stuart Attwell somehow missed it. From a subsequent corner, Newport’s Jamille Matt should have scored from a narrow angle, but his shot-cum-cross was stopped by Jass Labadie on the line. At Griffin Park, Brentford have taken the lead against their non-League opponents, with Sergi Canos opening the scoring, converting from close range as a corner came his way. There’s an early goal at Molineux, where Wolves have taken the lead against their League One opponents. Wolves have a corner cleared and Morgan Gibbs-White sends in a cross. The ball breaks for Matt Doherty who makes no mistake. 6 min: Playing in all white, Middlesbrough win a corner when George Friend puts the ball out of play off a Newport defender. The ball’s played to Jonny Howson outside the Newport box and he unleashes a shot from distance. It sails wide, but not by much. Newport 0-0 Middlesbrough: They’ve kicked off at Rodney Parade, where there’s a lot of surface water on a pitch that has hosted over 60 rugby and football matches in the past year. It’s a filthy night in Wales and the pitch is turning into a bog. In the evnt of any of our four Cup matches ending in draws tonight, there’ll be extra time and possibly penalties. Not long now: Our fourth round replays are about to kick off and we’ll be focussing mainly on Newport County v Middlesbrough, while keeping you up to date with the three other matches as they unfold. Weather report: It’s chucking down with rain at Rodney Parade, where little puddles are forming on a very sodden pitch ahead of Newport County’s match against Middlesbrough. I fancy the Welsh outfit to cause an upset here tonight. Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo makes six changes for the FA Cup fourth round replay with Shrewsbury. John Ruddy, Morgan GIbbs-White, Romain Saiss, Ivan Cavaleiro, Adama Traore and Helder Costa all start at Molineux. Former Wolves midfielder Dave Edwards has overcome a groin injury to make the bench for the Sky Bet League One visitors.Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo may field a few fringe players against tonight’s League One opposition, in a move that could open him to criticism is his Premier League outfit gets beaten. With Wolves’ Premier League status already secure and a fifth round tie against Bristol City awaiting the winners of tonight’s match, the Midlands club have a glorious chance to win the FA Cup for the first time since 1960. Diogo Jota will definitely miss out after picking up a knock against Everton at the weekend, while Ruben Vinagre is also out with illness. Ruben Neves faces a late fitness test and may start on the bench, if at all.“They will come here, and for them it is a cup final,” said Nuno. “So we expect a very tough game against a highly motivated team. We have to match them in that regard. I know it’s going to almost be a full house, I’m really glad for it because we’re going to need their support.”For the Shrews, Mat Sadler and Anthony Grant must sit this one out on the naughty step, while manager Sam Ricketts is cautiously optimistic Dave Edwards can return from injury to play some part in proceedings.Tomer Hemed has recovered from a hernia operation and may make tonight’s match squad. Steve McClaren will have to make do without Angel Rangel and on-loan Geoff Cameron, who are both injured. “I like the buzz that has been created and that is why I put great significance on the first game,” said McClaren. “We had to get a result and make sure we got in the hat. We did that and that has given the winners Watford at home which is an extra incentive to play for. We’ve none more so than to win. We want to go through in the Cup. As much for the supporters than anything, it’s going to be a great atmosphere with plenty of fans.”Portsmouth manager Kenny Jackett will be without the four signings he made last week, as none of the players concerned were at the club for the drawn game at Fratton Park. Dion Donohue is also out, while defender Jack Whatmough is a doubt.Joe Daly is back between the sticks for Newport, having missed the original match to be with his wife who was due to give birth to twins. Middlesbrough boss Tony Pulis is liklely to make changes to the side that beat West Brom by the odd goal of five on Saturday, as they line up for their fourth game in 12 days.“I am not thinking about Man City one bit, not a chance,” said Newport manager Michael Flynn. “This could end up like Bullseye - Bully’s special prize, look what you could have won. You start getting carried away and you see the boat floating off, and you end up with a rubber dinghy. I have too much respect for Tony Pulis, too much respect for Middlesbrough Football Club, and that is all I’m thinking about.” We believe him, although thousands wouldn’t.Brentford full-back Rico Henry has been ruled out of tonight’s game after picking up an injury in his team’s win over Blackburn on Saturday, while midfielders Lewis Macleod and Emiliano Marcondes are also out.As a consequence of all this, officials of Barnet FC have decided to give their boardroom tickets to the players’ families and not to attend the boardroom of Brentford FC,” said Kleanthous in a statement. “This is in order to show solidarity with our fans who will now miss out on this very special occasion.”We have four FA Cup fourth round replays to keep tabs on tonight, all between teams from different isions. Following their thriller at The Hive, Brentford and Barnet will resume battle at Griffin Park, where the only non-League side left in this year’s competition hope to secure a fifth round home tie against Swansea.Meanwhile in Wales, a home tie against Manchester City is the reward for whoever prevails at Rodney Parade between League Two side Newport County and their Championship opponents Middlesbrough. At Loftus Road, Championship side QPR will be hoping to end a poor recent run of form when they entertain Portsmouth from the top end of the ision below. And finally, at Molineux, Wolves take on Shrewsbury Town from League One, with a home tie against Watford in the next round up for grabs.All four games start at 7.45pm (GMT) and we’ll provide news of all the goals as they go in, as well as other talking points. In the meantime, stay tuned for team news and build-up as we countdown to kick-off.

Participants saw “significant improvements in diet, weight, wellbeing, self-esteem, vitality and biomarkers of cardiometabolic health”, the authors found.Men attended the sessions as part of the EU-funded EuroFIT programme, which aims to use football’s strong appeal to persuade men to overhaul their lifestyles. It uses the lustre of their club and the venue where they usually go as a fan to cheer them on to encourage participation.Fans of Newcastle United and Stoke City were also involved in the scheme, which is being extended to more European countries.In a paper in the journal PLOS Medicine, the study’s authors say their findings confirm that “engaging men in physical activity through programmes that work with existing constructs of masculinity is a promising route for promoting men’s health”.They found that participants in the randomised control trial began walking an average of 678 steps a day more than those who were waiting to join the programme as a result of coming to the sessions, which they termed a “substantial” increase. Doctors generally recommend at least 10,000 steps a day to promote good health.Participants’ activity levels were monitored by a device called a SitFIT which they carried in their pocket. In addition, a game-based app called MatchFIT encouraged them to meet and undertake activities together in between the sessions, which were delivered by football coaches.The scheme is designed to help men reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes or having a heart attack or stroke, rather than treating an existing condition.Sally Wyke, the programme’s principal investigator, who is a professor of health and wellbeing at the University of Glasgow, said: “Gender-sensitised lifestyle programmes delivered in professional football clubs show great promise in Europe and could play an important health role in engaging under-served men.”When attendees were monitored a year after they had finished the scheme, efforts to overhaul the men’s diets had worked. Participants continued to eat more fruit and vegetables and less fat and sugar.However, other benefits of the scheme were less enduring. The participants were no longer any more active than men who had not yet been on the programme. They also said they had not experienced any increase in their quality of life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cc8c29d02110128fea6ca3d6b431ecf690d78c4/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83a38a3ff546c81eb7e16c70d062617","title":"chinese lunar new year 2019 in pictures","story":"To welcome the year of the pig more than a billion people across the world have begun celebrating.

That’s what I’m assuming, but I haven’t fixed a date,” the broadcaster told the Daily Mail. He said he had previously believed he would carry on doing the job “either until they threw me out or had enough of me, or that I’d got bored of it or stopped enjoying it, but none of those things have happened.”He added: “I still enjoy it enormously. I know that sounds ridiculous. There are mornings in mid-February when you don’t want to get up at half past three. But, equally, there are other things I want to do with my life, and one has to make the decision sooner or later.”The presenter’s supposedly imminent retirement has been the subject of media speculation for more than a decade. Much of this has been stoked by Humphrys himself, who would give interviews predicting his own departure before going on to sign a contract extension.The BBC declined to comment on Humphrys’ future.If the 75-year-old does depart after almost a third a of century with the same programme then it would end a high-profile and often controversial stint on the airwaves during which he shaped the reporting of British politics. His aggressive interview style on the programme won both fans and detractors, with his political stance coming under particular scrutiny following the Brexit referendum.Humphrys, who as a young journalist reported on the 1966 Aberfan mining disaster, later joined the BBC where he worked as a foreign correspondent before becoming lead presenter on the Nine O’Clock News. He then transferred to the Today programme in 1987, where he has covered the administrations of six different prime ministers for the Radio 4 show.In recent years he has been writing a book on his times with the programme entitled The Today Files, and could find it hard to promote the inside story of the programme while still appearing on the airwaves.Last year he was at the centre of an equal pay row after a recording leaked of him making off-air comments about the BBC’s gender pay gap, following the resignation of BBC China editor Carrie Gracie in protest at inequality at the corporation.BBC pay disclosure figures revealed that in 2017 he received between £600,000 and £649,999 from the corporation for his work on the Today programme and presenting the quiz show Mastermind. Following an outcry he agreed to take a substantial pay cut, with his combined salary set to fall below £300,000 by next year.Today programme editor Sarah Sands has previously described Humphrys as a “listeners’ champion”, and said “he will know when it feels right” to leave.“He’s extremely curious, he’s extremely engaged, fantastically interested in new subjects and new people and real people. The overall purpose in him is pursuit of truth,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f84e733526d67ba0ae91daa75d92f76e25032c/0_153_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a383a839d61adf38b632ac036a5c4c50","title":"is climate change way worse than we realise today in focus podcast","story":"David Wallace-Wells, the author of new book The Uninhabitable Earth, depicts a world ravaged by climate chaos.

But if Theresa May were to stick to that principle then she’d never say anything. Which might be doing everyone else a favour, but isn’t generally considered to be a sound operating tactic for a prime minister.So every now and again – both to let off steam and to appear in control – May’s random speech generator is put into action. A near meaningless tumble of words that die the moment they are uttered. Each sentence forgotten before it is even completed. An exercise in futility that is every bit as painful for her as her audiences. Being prime minister is an act of masochism for May and sadism for the country.This time it was the turn of business leaders in Belfast to be strapped to their chairs and drip-fed the prime minister’s patented brand of existential Largactil. She began by observing Northern Ireland and Ireland were actually joined by a land border and that there were roads, fields and hedges nearby. This may have been news to her, but it wasn’t to anyone else in the room and a loud bleep sounded as the transmission was interrupted. Presumably to make sure no one outside the room could hear the audience swearing.“We’ve come a long way in the past two-and-a-half years,” she continued, the rest of the sentence drowned out by another convenient high-pitched bleep. A long way, as in we’d made next to no progress at all in resolving the Irish border problems. With just over 50 days until the UK was due to crash out of the EU with a no deal that would guarantee a hard border, the government literally had no idea how to avoid a hard border.But never mind. Love would find a way. No one loved Ireland more than May. No one. Which is why she had gone out of her way not to go there that often and to talk to almost no one other than the Democratic Unionist party for the last couple of years. She then gave a quick resume of recent Irish history, which everyone already knew, before saying she would defend the Good Friday agreement with her life. There would be no hard border. Promise.She wasn’t going to sell out Ireland with alternative arrangements that didn’t work. Even though she had set up an alternative arrangements working group made up of Owen Paterson and Marcus Fysh, two of the stupidest members of the Tory party, who could be relied on to come up with solutions, involving highly-trained, well-armed badgers and carrier pigeons, that were totally unworkable. But ssssh! Don’t let anyone know that she thought they were morons.And that was that. Except it wasn’t. May was under instructions to talk for 21 minutes exactly and she had only spoken for seven. So she went back to the beginning and started again. Being on a loop has never bothered the Maybot. Ireland was a country with a border and a troubled history. No one loved Ireland more than she did. She would find a way to avoid a hard border even though she didn’t have a clue how right now. And when she had got to the end for a second time, she repeated herself a third time. When she could get a word in edgeways between the bleeps.Then came the questions. Here it all got a bit nasty. Having spent so much of the last couple of years trying to appease the DUP and the ERG, it hadn’t occurred to her that the majority of Northern Ireland had voted to remain. But having sucked up the inevitable, they had then gone out of their way to support the backstop arrangements of the withdrawal agreement. Only to find that May had gone out of her way to disown her own deal.“BLEEP.... Shafted... BLEEP... Why should anyone trust you..? BLEEP” asked one reporter who spoke for most of the country. May looked genuinely confused. She hadn’t been expecting this at all. She stared at the floor and started mumbling. Um... parliament had voted to change the backstop... “It hadn’t BLEEP. It had voted to get BLEEP rid of it,” someone observed. The prime minister pressed on. She was going to change the backstop. Somehow. Somewhere. She’d find a new way of living.The audience slumped in despair. The chances of May getting a deal that would satisfy the EU and the DUP and ERG were vanishing before their eyes. The border wasn’t so much a maze of roads, fields and hedges. It was a creek. Shit creek. And the government was halfway up it without a paddle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f388748614c645431ae0733de592525425ec2b8e/0_260_4180_2508/master/4180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccfa8f7543778d3d67077ae2d2e7e6c3","title":"theresa may wont seamless border northern ireland brexit belfast","story":"Brexiters fear PM’s Belfast speech steps back from previous assurancesTheresa May fired a warning shot at Brexit supporters on Tuesday, insisting there was “no suggestion” Britain would leave the EU without an insurance provision to protect against a hard border in Northern Ireland.At a speech in Belfast, May would only accept that technology could “play a part” in any alternative arrangements and that she would not countenance anything that would disrupt the lives of border communities.Brexit supporters immediately expressed their alarm at some of May’s language, which they fear could be read as a step back from previous assurances. “She knows what she promised us,” one ERG source said. “Even if she didn’t mean what she said, we do.”The comments came as May prepared to meet EU leaders in Brussels for the first time since the historic defeat of her Brexit deal, where she is expected to formally request the reopening of the withdrawal agreement in order to address concerns about the backstop.The prime minister will travel to the Belgian capital on Thursday, meeting the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU parliament president Antonio Tajani, and the European council president. Donald Tusk. Both Tusk and Juncker have been adamant that the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened.Number 10 sources suggested they did not expect a warm reception, but that it would signal the start of a new diplomatic process, involving proposals on the backstop worked on by MPs and ministers.Earlier on Tuesday, May told her cabinet she would not countenance any delay to the UK’s exit on 29 March, a message to ministers such as Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid who have suggested at least some delay might now be inevitable. Ministers who are more pessimistic about the prospects of the UK leaving on time with a deal held their tongues in the meeting after May’s warning.“She was pretty clear she had no time for anyone calling for it to be extended,” one cabinet source said.However, senior government sources increasingly believe the impasse may not be resolved until March, given no full EU council summit is due until late that month. That may ultimately become an excuse, some believe, for the prime minister to delay the UK’s exit in order to finalise any compromise.In cabinet, ministers including Amber Rudd and Michael Gove are understood to have underlined how they did not believe the UK public had fully comprehended the severe damage no deal would do.May did not set out explicitly to her cabinet the changes she would seek when she meets EU leaders.However, speaking in Belfast, May said she knew there were anxieties in Northern Ireland about replacing the backstop arrangement and said there would always be an insurance option to prevent a hard border contained within the withdrawal agreement.“I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that does not contain that insurance policy for the future,” she said.“There is no suggestion that we are not going to ensure that in the future there is provision for this – it has been called an insurance policy, the backstop – that ensures that if the future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, there will be arrangements in place to ensure that we deliver no hard border.”Earlier in her speech, May also sounded a note of caution about the alternative arrangements that some MPs have been working on to replace the backstop. She said a seamless border was “the cornerstone around which the community in Northern Ireland has come together to deliver peace and prosperity”.“I will not do anything to put that at risk,” she said. “So while I have said that technology could play a part, and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.”Tory MPs from a number of different Brexit factions are working on a proposal for alternative technological arrangements to the backstop, known as the Malthouse compromise after the housing minister, Kit Malthouse, who brought the groups together.Members of the European Research Group, which is made up of Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers, agreed to back a compromise amendment last week on changes to the backstop after assurances from May that it would mean reopening the withdrawal agreement.Downing Street would not say if work by the Brexit secretary Steve Barclay, who is working with Conservative backbenchers on the Malthouse compromise, would conclude by the end of Wednesday.The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is also drawing up a proposal on legally binding limits to the backstop.At her speech in Belfast, May said she would never allow a hard border to be erected on the island of Ireland.“Northern Ireland does not have to rely on the Irish government or the European Union to prevent a return to borders of the past,” she said at a speech in Belfast. “The UK government will not let that happen. I will not let that happen.”May said she understood that the “prospect of changing the backstop and reopening the withdrawal agreement creates real anxiety” in Northern Ireland but it was necessary to get the deal through the Commons.The audience of Northern Ireland business owners and executives gave lukewarm applause to her speech. Several said they were frustrated that her plan to avoid a hard border and disruption to trade remained unclear.Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said he hoped a meeting with May after her speech would clarify how she intended to reconcile promises on the backstop with avoiding a hard border.“You’re talking about the disintegration of the supply chain. Northern Ireland is in the eye of the storm,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04e278c9e78b2d7edf41ad6ba93d1281e5461ad/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32d3aa46cf04022679bd293875a9a2e8","title":"the uk no longer feels like home the british europhiles racing for eu passports","story":"Thousands of Britons have applied for citizenship elsewhere since the Brexit vote. Here,  readers across Europe explain why they made the decisionBrexit is turning the UK into a country of dual citizens. An Irish grandparent is now the most prized possession in the land, giving the proud owner the right to an Irish (and thus an EU) passport. Applications for Irish passports are surging – 200,000 Britons applied in 2018. About half of these were from Northern Ireland – anyone born on the island of Ireland before 2005 and anyone born there since with a parent who is Irish, British or “entitled to live in Northern Ireland or the Irish state without restriction on their residency” is entitled to Irish citizenship. The other half are Britons living outside Ireland who have suddenly discovered an affinity with the birthplace of a parent or a grandparent. The number of applications has doubled since the referendum, with by far the greater increase coming from outside the island of Ireland. That burgundy passport is now extremely highly prized.My family is contributing to this: my son, through my wife, has an Irish grandmother and has claimed Irish citizenship. This year, he may visit his new homeland for the first time. His grandmother, who was born near Cork, came over to join the war effort against Hitler and never returned. Eighty years on, her daughter and grandson retain a foothold in the EU and a place in the postwar vision of a unified Europe.The Mosses are not alone. Indeed, the pursuit of dual nationality by Britons disaffected by Brexit or seeking to protect their residential, health or working rights is happening all over Europe. When we asked  readers who have applied for citizenship elsewhere to get in touch, more than 1,100 people replied. Many were applying for Irish, German, French, Belgian and Swedish citizenship, but plenty of other countries were represented, including Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Hungary and Malta. There were a surprising number of applications for Latvian citizenship, some from descendants of Latvians who fled to the UK following the Soviet takeover of their country in 1944.John Gribbon, an IT manager who lives and works in England, is one of the hundreds of thousands who have become Irish recently – his citizenship was granted in 2018. “I wanted the opportunity to work wherever I chose in Europe and did not welcome the fact that the opportunity had been removed by the Brexiteers,” he says.Gribbon’s grandfather, who died in 1964, was born in Belfast in 1915, served in the British army and worked as a sheet-metal worker in the Tyne shipyards. He had nine children and “lived for their freedom and opportunity”, says 46-year-old Gribbon, who has become an Irish citizen to preserve his own freedom and opportunity. “I had the Willy Wonka ticket 100 years later,” he says. “Although I never met him, his parting gift, being an Irishman, was the best present I could ever have. England was my past and will always be part of me as it’s who I am, but Ireland will give me the freedom to be who I want to be.”Matt Hurley, a 22-year-old Earth sciences master’s student at Utrecht University, became an Irish citizen in 2017. “I have always felt that I was Irish, as my father is Irish, while my mother was born in England to Irish parents,” he says. “I had never contemplated getting Irish citizenship, as it felt like I was taking something from a country I have never contributed to.” But now, he says: “Britain no longer feels like home, as it has rejected Europe and I have not.” Of course, there are also practical advantages: “Getting an Irish passport has enabled me to live abroad without the worry of my tuition fees being increased to the same level as non-EU students or having to apply for some kind of student visa.”The statistics on Irish dual citizenship are particularly notable because the number of Britons eligible is far higher than for any other country and the process of applying is straightforward – automatic and free citizenship for children of people born in Ireland on production of the relevant birth documents a fee of about £250 (£130 for children) to get yourself on the Foreign Births Register if you were born outside Ireland but have an Irish grandparent. However, the same pattern is apparent throughout Europe (except in Spain and Poland, neither of which permits dual citizenship for foreign nationals – one reason why so many British expats in Spain are likely to return in the event of a no-deal Brexit). The number of UK citizens who applied for German citizenship, for instance, more than doubled in 2017 compared with 2016, rising from 2,865 to 7,493. The number of Britons applying to become German is more than 10 times greater than before the 2016 referendum.One remarkable result of the EU referendum is the number of people whose families fled the Nazis who are now reclaiming German citizenship. “I was born in Palestine in 1944, the child of stateless German-born refugees who had been deprived of their citizenship because they were deemed to be Jewish,” says Nancy Krauss, a retired doctor in East Anglia. “I was brought up only speaking English because my parents wanted us to feel as though we belonged to the UK. I am now applying for German citizenship alongside my British citizenship. The spur was Brexit. German citizenship will allow me, my daughter and grandchildren to remain European, which gives us more options if things get very difficult in this country. Underlying that, though, is a sense of righting a wrong, returning to the roots – at least mentally – that belonged to my parents and of which they were unjustly deprived. If the German government now wants to make amends, I welcome that.”Germany is extremely popular because it ranks third (with France) on the Henley Passport Index, which ranks countries by the number of destinations passport-holders can visit without having to arrange a visa. Ben Wright, a 51-year-old management consultant who lives in Germany with his wife and family, has just become a dual citizen. “I’ve spent the past 25 years working, living and travelling across Europe,” he says. “I’ve seen walls come down and barriers to movement fall. Brexit is offering blue passports. That doesn’t disguise the fact the passport is being devalued.” Wright blames Theresa May. “The Brexit vote was not the major issue,” he says. “It was May’s decision that the UK would leave the single market and the customs union. That makes a new passport essential, in case I want to work in Switzerland or elsewhere in the EU.”Karen Stone, the general manager and artistic director of the theatres and orchestra of Magdeburg, waited barely a day after the referendum to start her application for dual citizenship. “It took a year, huge amounts of paperwork, an exam to prove that I was fluent in German and another on the German law and constitution,” she says. “The whole thing cost around €1,200, but now I finally have the guarantee of the same freedom of movement and security that I had for the previous 40 years.”Like many people who have lived abroad for a long period, she is furious that she was not allowed to vote in the referendum because she had lived outside the UK for more than 15 years – the cut-off for eligibility. “I hope that, should there be a second referendum, this decision would be reviewed,” she says.The number of Britons applying for Dutch, Swedish and French citizenship has risen enormously, too. In the absence of any progress on Guy Verhofstadt’s idea to offer Europe-minded Britons associate citizenship of the EU, those who qualify – by birth, marriage or residence – for another European country are taking matters into their own hands.In France, Beci Clayton was quick to apply after the referendum result, worried that if she did not her family would find themselves in difficulties. The 35-year-old English teacher lives in Brittany and is married to a French man her two young children are dual nationals. “I had always thought we would return to the UK I no longer know if that will be possible, but at least I know that my family will be able to stay together in France. I will be able to live and work in France indefinitely and this is a great relief for me. My national identity used to be hugely important to me. Now I am embarrassed to be British and feel quite lost.”Peter Tuck, a 45-year-old vet in Grosbliederstroff – which sounds German, but is in north-eastern France, right on the border of the two countries – is in a similar situation. “I moved to France in 2002 with my German wife and we have been living here ever since. Our two children were born in France. We live in France, but our children cross the border every day to go to school in Saarbrücken,” he says.“After the referendum, we went through the French naturalisation process quite quickly. For us, freedom of movement is a joy and a privilege. Our region is completely dependent on the border being open and invisible and we can’t imagine anyone wanting to reintroduce checks that have been removed. For my kids, Brexit is incomprehensible.”James Reynolds is a 38-year-old teacher at an international school in Staffanstorp, Sweden. Married to a Swedish woman and with a two-year-old son, he was worried about his family’s rights in the event of a no-deal Brexit – and about the rules regarding income levels for spouses if he wanted to relocate to the UK. “I have decided most probably never to return to the UK, as my family doesn’t feel welcome,” he says. “This is a shame, as I’m a UK-qualified teacher with 15 years’ experience, although it has to be said that teaching in Sweden is far less stressful than in the UK.”Romit Jain, a 43-year-old Londoner of Indian heritage, is another Briton who has successfully sought Swedish citizenship. “I applied within a week of the referendum and was granted citizenship within four weeks,” says Jain, who works for a Swedish company and is currently based in South Africa. “I was eligible for Swedish citizenship because I am married to a Swede and had been living there for about five years. The process went incredibly smoothly and I even got a nationality certificate in the post. My wife doesn’t have one of those, so I joke that this makes me more Swedish than her.”Jain embodies the ludicrousness of May’s denigration of “citizens of nowhere”. “Swedes used to ask me, before the referendum, if I would take Swedish nationality, because I was eligible anyway,” he says. “I always answered that I didn’t need it and I saw it as a practical question, as opposed to one about identity. But after the referendum I realised that it is about identity as well. I feel Swedish and British, European and Indian. I don’t see that as contradictory, although England versus Sweden in the World Cup was tricky.”Some people didn’t even wait for the referendum result before they started the process of getting a second passport. Richard Ventham, a 44-year-old who works in the pharmaceutical industry, began investigating dual citizenship when David Cameron announced he would hold a referendum. Having lived in Belgium since 2003, he says: “I couldn’t trust the xenophobic British public to make the right decision. I became Belgian in March 2016 and haven’t had a sleepless night since. I’m European – and no xenophobic, closed-minded, small majority can take that away from me.”Ventham is rather more emotional and committed a European than most of the bloodless technocrats who argued for remain in 2016. He describes the potential loss of freedom of movement as a “tragedy”. “My wife and children are Belgian. I suppose some people think I jumped the gun to apply prior to the referendum, but I could read the runes and the hysteria in the tabloid newspapers and wanted my status assured. I cling on to hope of a second referendum to reverse the decision, but as I’ve lived in Belgium for more than 15 years I’m no longer eligible to vote in it. I’ve been disenfranchised.”Oliver Gompertz, a pilot based in London, is applying for a Maltese passport. “People often scoff and ask: ‘Is that the one you can just buy?’” he says, referring to the countries that offer a fast track to permanent residence and sometimes citizenship if applicants are willing to make a substantial investment in the country. “But I’m entitled to it through my grandparents.” It has not, however, been a straightforward process: “I started assembling the documentation required more than three years ago and then it was a question of getting appointments with the embassy in London, which took about six months, and then waiting for your application to be processed, which took another 18 months. Then you need another appointment to get your passport.”He believes it will be worth it. “It’s partly about career security,” he says. “But for me it’s mainly about how I feel about my identity. When you go to the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand – crossing the border, you’re made to feel like an outsider because you don’t have the right to be there. I don’t want to feel like that going to Europe.”For many people, it is a practical issue, too. Jane Johnson, a 55-year-old academic in Bologna, Italy, has just completed an application for Italian citizenship. She was motivated, she says, in part by fear of losing “access to the wonderful state health service in Bologna”.But I believe Gompertz’s more emotive argument resonates. For almost 50 years, despite the half-heartedness of the British political class, we have been citizens of Europe, with unfettered access to that beautiful, varied, culturally rich continent. Some part of us could claim to be French or Spanish, Italian or German. We had fought many wars with our neighbours now we could enjoy a long peace and claim a stake in their wonderful countries.Brexit may change this for ever. While my wife and son are safe in their new nationalities, the angry Welshman in our family – me – is about to lose his EU passport and the fantasy that he is Spanish. Is this really the end of the dream? If I set up a small business in Plov, how long will it be before I qualify for Bulgarian citizenship?Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3d92639fee97068d7232079ce8aa629cae4a891/157_194_2107_1264/master/2107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e19d51970337142bf51565bd44f60091","title":"thousands of six nations tickets touted on viagogo investigation reveals","story":"More than a thousand tickets for the Six Nations have appeared for sale on the controversial website Viagogo for a combined £370,000, according to  analysis that illustrates the grip wielded by ticket touts over in-demand events.Details of the scale at which Six Nations tickets are being touted prompted concern from the digital minister, Margot James, and condemnation from rugby governing bodies, who warned that Viagogo’s customers risk being refused entry at the turnstile. examined 1,155 tickets with a “Trader” label advertised on Viagogo for the Six Nations and found they were being listed for £369,526, including VAT, delivery costs and booking fees, collected by the website.The true amount of tickets controlled by touts is likely to be much higher, given that the ’s analysis covered only two days of Viagogo listings.These tickets, two-thirds of which were in the hands of just five traders, are listed despite the risk that buyers will be turned away at the door.James said the ’s findings were very concerning. “Fans should be able to attend major sporting events at a fair price,” she said.She pointed out that Viagogo was the subject of a court order by the Competition and Markets Authority, which has taken action against the company over alleged breaches of consumer law. “Viagogo must now make any necessary changes without delay and I expect the CMA to take further action if they fail to do so,” she said.The CMA has already warned that it has “serious concerns” about Viagogo’s compliance with the terms of the court order. And listings for Six Nations games raise fresh doubts about whether the company is abiding by its terms.The trader with the highest combined ticket worth was listed as Enda Stanley who had 173 tickets for sale with a total asking price of £79,719 (including booking fees and delivery).While the CMA’s court order calls for traders’ full contact information to be advertised, entries for Stanley’s tickets simply listed his details as “Dublin”.The highest number of tickets for sale by an inidual trader was under the name of an Eileen Green, who listed 290 tickets with a combined price of £64,704.Another prolific seller, a company called Tick Tock Ltd that listed its address as Panama City, had 100 tickets the combined cost of which stood at £45,981. Another trader, Candy \u0026amp Co, gave a postbox address in Texas, while a fifth, Tyne and Wear Ltd, is based in Newcastle.The most expensive tickets, for sale by a trader listed as “harry tout” carried a total cost of £4,772 for two seats in the fourth row with a view of the tryline for the sold-out match between Scotland and Ireland at Murrayfield on 9 February.The tickets were marked as “Resale not allowed”.Despite the CMA’s court order, which demands that traders give their genuine contact details, the address for “harry tout” was given as the Scottish newspaper the Daily Record, which has campaigned virulently against ticket touting. The Daily Record said it had no involvement with the listing.None of the traders could be reached for comment.A spokesman for the Rugby Football Union said the use of secondary market websites to resell tickets is prohibited by the RFU’s ticket terms and conditions and that ticket holders known to have breached the terms and conditions would be refused entry.“Where tickets are resold on secondary market websites – especially at inflated prices – it is not just the genuine fans, but the wider game, whom suffer.”The Irish Rugby Football Union urged fans not to buy resold tickets, which they said might be cancelled. The Welsh Rugby Union also warned fans against buying from ticket resale companies, warning that buyers risked ejection from the ground.This stance does not appear to dissuade traders. Touts have 194 tickets for sale for Scotland vIreland alone with a combined ticket price of £57,758 which, if sold, will prove the most lucrative game of the tournament for traders.Traders are selling 223 tickets for sale for the Scotland v Wales match on 9 March with a combined value of £49,318.When contacted, Viagogo said it was “perfectly legal” to resell tickets and that any bought through its website were valid and should not result in fans being turned away.A spokesperson said: “Event organisers sometimes make claims that they will deny entry to people who have purchased resold tickets. These types of entry restrictions are highly unfair and in our view, unenforceable and illegal.“Therefore, as with all tickets on our platform, Viagogo customers should feel confident that they will gain entry to the event, and that is why we back every ticket with the Viagogo guarantee.”Under the terms of the CMA’s court order secured against the company, Viagogo has been obliged to publish not just names of touts but also more detailed information about what consumers are buying, such as seat number at the venue.But the  found dozens of cases that did not display the seat number.Tom Watson, the shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport and deputy Labour leader, said it was “disgraceful to see that ticket touts on Viagogo are still ripping off rugby fans”.“Viagogo has been told time and again that it needs to clean up its act. They are flagrantly disobeying the law and even ignoring a court order. It’s unacceptable that consumers may not be able to see basic details about their tickets, like the seller’s name and the seat number. Secondary ticketing platforms have been taking advantage of loyal fans for far too long. This has got to change.”In late January the CMA, which had given Viagogo until mid-January to overhaul its business practices, said the changes made by Viagogo after the court order were “insufficient”.Viagogo, in turn, issued a statement which simply said: “We are compliant.” analysed all listings for Six Nations tickets listed on the Viagogo website which carried a “Trader” logo on two consecutive days.The analysis covers 1,007 unique tickets on sale on the Viagogo website on Wednesday 30 January plus 148 unique tickets which subsequently came up for sale on Thursday 31 January. Checks were carried out to ensure no duplicate tickets were recorded by manually checking the ticket details, price and trader."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/209281cba8df24c945e0d1e9729c2fc050956275/0_77_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df6d3870f33bcdf63ec541c5113183f0","title":"wales thomas young six nations debut italy","story":"• Wasps forward steps up after adapting to intense Wales training• Garry Ringrose and Devin Toner out for IrelandThomas Young is in line to make his Six Nations debut for Wales against Italy in Rome on Saturday after impressing during training in Nice.The 26-year-old was picked for the first time by Warren Gatland last month. Young’s caps against Tonga and Samoa in 2017, after he had been in the training group for the Six Nations that year without making the match-day 23, came when Gatland was on sabbatical with the Lions.The flanker has become one of the leading players at the breakdown with Wasps in the Premiership but the feeling two years ago was that he struggled to adapt to the extra pace Wales adopt in training.“Thomas has been a consistent performer for Wasps,” said the Wales forwards coach, Robin McBryde. “He is playing in a league where he is up against big men every week and the intensity is there. He has won several man-of-the-match awards, making intelligent decisions when to compete for the ball in defence and linking with the backs in attack.“He is doing that here as well. Our training is different to club level, the metres covered and the intensity is up but he has dealt with it. Everyone has the opportunity to stake a claim and if they get it, they have to make the most of it.”Wales stayed in France after Friday’s Six Nations victory in Paris to prepare for their second match. Gatland took 31 players to Nice to replicate the number of players he will have at the World Cup in September and is likely to change a winning side before the third match against England.“It has been good to recuperate here after a tough match,” McBryde said. “You could not ask for better surroundings but we have some hard work to do before Italy and cannot slip into holiday mode.“Everybody realises the importance for the first two games and the momentum it can create by getting positive results.“Italy will be tough to crack and we have to improve from last Friday. They will be buoyed by the last 15 minutes at Murrayfield when they came back strongly. They showed how dangerous they can be in attack and it will be a big test for us. We have some tough decisions to make in selection.”The centre Garry Ringrose and the lock Devin Toner will miss Ireland’s match against Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday. Ringrose has picked up a hamstring complaint, while Toner has aggravated an ankle injury. CJ Stander was already missing owing to facial fractures but the wing Keith Earls appears to have overcome a hip problem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f601f3865a5dfcbb6b31e74085fba43b977686ee/0_354_4674_2805/master/4674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40a3cdf5d9f05bfd62e231ce537f8f39","title":"gerry cranham simply the best in pictures","story":"Over the course of a career which ned half a century, photographer Gerry Cranham led the field of sports photography, defining how we understand this genre today.

During the morning editorial meeting, broadcast live to the nation under the vaguely ridiculous banner of Sky News Raw, an editor looked up from her pile of papers and sighed “Should we do a piece about Sky News Raw?”There followed some back and forth, right there on Sky News Raw, about whether or not Sky News should indeed do a piece about Sky News Raw. The matter was then discussed of the broadcaster best positioned to do it. A name was mooted, and the woman shook her head. “He can’t do a piece on Sky News Raw because he’s currently doing Sky News Raw,” she mumbled as a million different realities crashed into each other and imploded behind her.If – to quote the great sage Matt Goss – CNN is the thinking man’s reality show, then Sky News Raw has to qualify as Einstein’s Big Brother. For one day only, to mark the channel’s 30th anniversary, the entire workings of the channel have been exposed to the world. We, the viewers, get to watch all the backstage shenanigans of Sky News as they happen.All day long, as Sky News fills its day with the usual cobblers – a slick cocktail of essential breaking news and aggressively non-essential Jon Culshaw interviews – cameras are showing us how the sausage is made. We have eavesdropped on staff meetings. We’ve watched reporters on location hurriedly run over their lines before they linked live to the studio. We have seen people in the gallery feed lines to Adam Boulton, just like Holly Hunter in Broadcast News if Holly Hunter in Broadcast News primarily existed to seamlessly line up a selection of heavy-handed satirical cartoons from that morning’s papers.One of the big stories of the day, the editors decided this morning, was Liam Neeson’s bizarre decision to tell everyone that he wanted to randomly murder a black person once. This threw everyone for a loop. By the time the story would air, it’d be over a day old. How could they move the story on? Should they find someone to defend him? Perhaps they could do a viewer poll: one editor suggested “Have you ever had an angry racist thought?” as the question to put to the country.In moments like this, you were struck by what a mad gamble this whole thing is. News as we know it – especially broadcast news – is a finished product. What we read and watch and hear is the result of countless meetings like this, batted back and forth until all the bad ideas have been shaken out. To watch people actively lobbing bad ideas into the mix (and hopefully being rejected the poll hadn’t run at time of writing) feels incredibly cavalier of Sky, especially in an age when social media is so quick to condemn missteps like this.Nevertheless I’m pleased it exists, if only because it has showed how absolutely bored everyone who works for Sky News is. Everywhere – the newsroom, the gallery, the studio floor – is packed with glum-looking people mundanely going about their jobs. In fairness, this is true of all other news channels and all other newsrooms and most other offices. I, for one, have found this boredom incredibly reassuring.Unlike Twitter, where every microscopic news story explodes on impact like a meteor shower, Sky News Raw showed us how calmly events are absorbed and redistributed in the real world. It is actually quite soothing. If it was a subscription channel, sign me up. Watching people silently stare at screens with pens in their mouths is apparently an unbelievably peaceful thing to do.In fact, I think I prefer Sky News Raw to Sky News itself. At all times, in the top right of the screen, there is a muted feed of the actual Sky News output. Compared to the gentle ebb and flow of the backstage news gathering, it looks like a circus a dumb, brightly-coloured procession of talking heads scowling and jabbing at absolutely nothing just to fill time. It is, for want of a better word, a distraction.So please Sky News, keep this experiment going. I’d watch regularly if you did, if only because it makes me happy that you’ve continued the grand newsroom tradition of installing overdesigned yet wildly impractical seating wherever possible.Now if anyone needs me, I’ll be watching Sky News Raw to see if this review of Sky News Raw gets mentioned on Sky News Raw."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca901788f39b5428c787161849411ec03bf1c04d/213_0_1614_968/master/1614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=331f1105fdfd71e698b2cb7bf1f65a96","title":"surviving r kelly review disturbing but deeply flawed","story":"This documentary series shares the appalling stories of women who claim they have suffered at the R\u0026ampB star’s hands, but at times it feels exploitativeScales. Scales are what you think of when you watch the six hours – and it will be the entire six hours you watch, waiting for the moment that pulls the whole incredible, appalling story into a comprehensible shape – of Surviving R Kelly (Crime+Investigation).The scales of justice first. Where are they in this six-part documentary – already aired to much outrage and uproar in the US – that pulls together the rumours, allegations and court cases surrounding the talented, popular and lucrative phenomenon that is the R\u0026ampB star Robert Kelly over his 30-year career? They began, basically, as soon as he was old enough for an interest in underage girls to be possible. In his 20s, he was hanging around the local high school and picking up teenagers. As his success grew, it seems, so did his appetites. Surviving R Kelly illuminates the timeline with the testimony of women who claim in detail that they suffered at his hands. Tales of being approached at 14, 15, 16 or 17 by the star or his people and invited back to his mansion abound. Once there, they were frequently “trained” by him, they say: kept apart from each other and their families told not to talk back or talk at all told to ask for permission to go to the lavatory or to watch television told to have sex with him, and each other, whenever he felt like it. If they objected, they claim, they would be beaten, starved or ignored for days at a time.One can only assume that life went similarly for his wife, Aaliyah (who died in a plane crash in 2001), whom he first met when she was 12 and – thanks to forged papers – married when she was 15. Kelly wrote and produced her first album, Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number – recorded when she was 14 – about a young girl trying to persuade an older man to go to bed with her. One of the other girls – children – around at the time, Jovante Cunningham, recalls seeing them having sex in the tour bus and shakes her head as she says: “He destroyed a lot of people, a lot of people who loved and adored him. And I can’t stress to you enough how much people are still suffering.”Next, scales falling from people’s eyes. Cunningham says it happened for her on that bus, but for other people they clung on much longer. Demetrius Smith, who helped forge the papers and is one of several members of Kelly’s entourage interviewed for the series, remembers that Aaliyah looked “worried and scared” and that it “broke his heart” when he found out that Kelly had, contrary to what he had told him, “been messing with Aaliyah”.But Smith, and the rest of his people, stayed with Kelly. His record label didn’t bat an eye when a video emerged purporting to show their multimillion-dollar asset having sex with and urinating on an apparently underage girl, or when charges of “child pornography” were filed against him, or when allegations that he ran an abusive sex cult from his home were made. (Kelly denies he is the man in the video and was acquitted of all charges.) It is hard not to feel the power of the heartfelt denunciation of the mother of Dominique Gardner, who had not seen her daughter since she disappeared into Kelly’s world three years ago, that “money can buy you any fucking thing”.And so to the last set of scales. Let’s call them “the Cosby scales”. You put the alleged abuser’s fame and wealth on one side and keep adding – keep adding, keep adding – female testimony to the other and hope that one day the latter will outweigh the former and that proper investigation will ensue. If you are able to add high-profile reporting to the women’s words, your odds improve. This is how we live now.As a programme, Surviving R Kelly is deeply flawed. At best, it treads a fine line between attesting to the apparent pain of those taking part and exploiting it – and often gives in to temptation. The footage of Gardner’s mother rescuing her from the hotel where she discovered her daughter was staying is extraordinary, but the desperate, whispered exchanges between them as they arranged her escape are surely something for them alone.Perhaps more importantly, the programme doesn’t push any of Kelly’s entourage about alleged complicity. If you are going to show people’s pain like this, should it not be done in the service of some kind of reckoning?But since the documentary and the renewed energy of the activist group #MuteRKelly, his label has dropped him. The series may yet yield results that far outweigh its flaws. Let the scales start to slide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f734b55e5211c9279ee2b9bf23a4cc4e6bda6cf/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=443fa0ae9c4d4a451fdacc597ae9885c","title":"2020 presidential election candidates national conversation","story":"Trump is set on making the border wall the central issue in the next election – candidates will have to find their own narrative to counter himThe 2020 presidential campaign started amid a government shutdown premised on walling us off from the world. And just the other weekend, the government reopened for three weeks to see if we could come to terms with our identity as a nation of immigrants.Here in north-west Iowa, Congressman Steve King came home to a town hall meeting in Primghar. His rehabilitation after his white supremacist remarks and protecting “our” culture is underway. And as he stood there, quoting Rudyard Kipling to the gathered crowd, King made clear that Donald Trump will not relent on his border wall. When those who raise livestock asked him about the need for help, they were told that we first need order at the border. Stripped of his committee stripes by the minority leader, King assured the crowd that he is now liberated to pursue his national(ist) agenda. They seemed OK with that.At the time, the president was threatening calling a national emergency over immigration, and his chief of staff said he is serious as a heart attack. King’s OK with that, and nobody in Primghar is much saying otherwise.Progressives marveled at a woman – Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House – standing down Trump by barring his entry to the House to speak on the State of the Union.Three more women announced their candidacies amid this chaos: Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California. Harris came out of the gate on race and unity, her parents were both immigrants. Gillibrand is taking tough questions on her former hawkish views on immigration as an upstate New York representative who was converted to a more erse view in the Big Apple.Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, was raising hell in Puerto Rico over disenfranchisement, crushing debt and failed hurricane relief amid complete government dysfunction. Sherrod Brown of Ohio promised to bring his Dignity of Work tour to Iowa, as federal workers awaited their checks from the past month or more, and farmers breathed a sigh of relief with bankers as they try to arrange spring farm rents and planting.On that same weekend Representative Eric Swalwell, a Bay Area neighbor of Harris’s, was on television talking about the indictment of Roger Stone, the dirty trickster for Richard Nixon and now Trump. Swalwell wants to run, too, from his perch on the House prosecution team. He often suggests that Trump’s chaos, like the shutdown, is designed to distract from his original sin of dancing with the Russians. John Hickenlooper, who founded a brew pub in Colorado, tapped a keg from a pub in Des Moines and talked of pragmatism and common sense while King was still talking shutdown and cave-ins, and by gum that wall.And, in late January, Beto O’Rourke made it home to El Paso after meeting indigenous people along the old Great Western Cattle Trail, up through Tucumcari and the Great Plains of Kansas. He took a left at Dodge City and made his penultimate lighting in Taos, New Mexico, with the indigenous people on the butte. He learned of how Pueblos blend their spirituality with Catholicism. After his days in the desert he too dwelled on the need for unity as he further reflected on his next stop unknown.To cap it all off on 60 Minutes, Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks and billionaire extraordinaire, thought nothing of throwing $500m or so into an independent race. The two political parties are not up to it, his line went. He has the answer to shutdown fever, says a man who appears to think the corporation is the basic social unit that upholds mores, and not political parties. Which sounds similar to the current occupant and to Ross Perot, and maybe a little like Michael Bloomberg. There is no Starbucks in Primghar. Ethanol producers don’t like sugar taxes like Bloomberg does. If Schultz runs it “gives Trump his best hope of getting re-elected”, candidate Julián Castro of Texas told CNN.Every Latino knows what that means. More wall. More persecution. No asylum.Many wonder if a more amiable sort could ease us back from this political precipice. Uncle Joe Biden, who can slap backs in the Senate with the best of them, might have seen his hour pass. What’s so bad about speaking on behalf of a Republican? he wondered to scowls from the combatants on the left flank. John Delaney would like to be in that place, a moderate businessman who is somewhat suspect among the progressives in Iowa and New Hampshire. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota tries to toe that line, but has yet to announce against a formidable field. They say that Warren, who may have set the bar with an Iowa barnstorm two weeks into the shutdown assailing corruption, could meet her comeuppance in Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire, and Harris and Cory Booker in South Carolina. It’s all fed into the breech that is the national conversation, as it were.O’Rourke seems to frame the existential question: “As the country literally begins to shut down, how can we come together to revive her?” O’Rourke asked himself in an epistle from Taos.He knows we can, but he couldn’t yet say how, and that might be the question that keeps him bound, so far, to his home and young family in the Borderlands.King, the proxy for Trump, was not so much interested in the answer. Trump is set on the border being the issue heading right up to the next election. The shutdown was his opening salvo for the entire campaign. Iowa will play a role in moderating that schism, looking for that candidate with an iron fist inside a velvet glove."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcbe4ba65031a10c3df5e1aafbee126989c7a641/10_160_533_320/master/533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f620023b213fbfe323ceff18cf7c98a","title":"british man detained in uae after wearing qatar football t shirt to match","story":"A British football fan has been arrested and detained in the United Arab Emirates after he wore a Qatar national team shirt to a match.Ali Issa Ahmad, 26, a British Arsenal fan who lives in Wolverhampton, travelled to the UAE for a holiday in January. While he was there he got a ticket for an Asian Cup match between Qatar and Iraq on 22 January. The tournament took place in the UAE between 5 January and 1 February and was won by Qatar.Ahmad wore a Qatar shirt to the match not knowing that doing so in the UAE is an offence punishable with a large fine and an extended period of imprisonment.After his initial arrest he was held over claims that he had made false allegations about security officials, a friend of Ahmad told the .The UAE embassy said it was investigating the circumstances of the arrest and the Foreign Office (FCO) said it was offering support.The FCO website in its section containing information for travellers to the UAE warns: “The UAE authorities announced on 7 June 2017 that showing sympathy for Qatar on social media or by any other means of communication is an offence. Offenders could be imprisoned and subject to a substantial fine.”Its advice adds: “You should respect local traditions, customs, laws and religions at all times. There may be serious penalties for doing something that might not be illegal in the UK.”The sanctions for “promoting” Qatar are linked to the breaking off of diplomatic relations between the two countries in May 2017. The UAE accused Qatar of undermining security and stability in the region by funding and hosting terror groups. Ahmad was granted one phone call on 31 January and was able to call his friend Amer Lokie and raise the alarm.Lokie said: “This is just unspeakable. He just went to watch a football match while he was on holiday in UAE and says he was arrested and beaten after being accused of wearing a football shirt which promoted Qatar. When he managed to call me officials were sitting next to him so he couldn’t say too much. He wasn’t given very long to speak to me and I’m not exactly sure what happened.“It seems that he was released after being detained, assaulted by the security men in the car and accused of promoting Qatar. He went to the police station to report the assault and was accused of telling lies about the incident.“We’re not clear about exactly what happened next but he has been held because he is accused of making false allegations against UAE security officials. He said he is being held in a place called Al Sharjar.”Lokie added: “He loves football so much. He goes to watch lots of football matches in the UK. He’s such a kind and quiet guy. He is the kind of person who always tries to help others.“He didn’t sound good when he spoke to me on the phone. He was speaking very slowly and he sounded very frightened.”Lokie said that Ahmad’s phone had been taken by officials and wiped, adding that his friend had told him he was held in a small room for two days.“He begged us to do whatever we can to get him released so we contacted the Foreign Office and asked them to help get him released,” Lokie said. “He said he would call us back but since then we have not heard anything from him. I am in shock that he was arrested and assaulted because of the football T-shirt he was wearing. We are all so worried about him. This is very serious.”A UAE embassy spokesperson said: “The United Arab Emirates embassy is looking into allegations that a British citizen has been detained. The UAE is a nation built on the rule of law and respect for iniduals. We take any allegation of human rights violations extremely seriously – whether it concerns one of our citizens, or any of the 1.5 million Britons who visit us each year.”An FCO spokesperson said: “We are providing assistance to a British man arrested in the UAE and are in touch with the local authorities.”Last November the British academic Matthew Hedges returned to the UK after being accused of spying and jailed for life in UAE. He served seven months of his sentence, mostly in solitary confinement. He was released after receiving a pardon from the UAE authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3694b69aceaa044820d15541ec4abb9466480a85/0_118_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5d8e6e79f1ed7aa71d9acfe42176428","title":"former ivory coast president","story":"Prosecution may appeal the acquittal by ICC on charges of crimes against humanityFormer Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo has been released on bail to Belgium following his acquittal by the International Criminal Court in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity, the court said Tuesday.Belgium said on Saturday that it had agreed in principle to host Gbagbo pending a possible prosecution appeal against his acquittal, but that final arrangements were being made.The 73-year-old former strongman and his aide Charles Blé Goudé have been staying in an undisclosed location since Friday, when The Hague tribunal freed them from detention.“Mr Gbagbo is now released under conditions in Belgium,” an ICC spokeswoman said, without giving further details.ICC judges acquitted Gbagbo and Blé Goudé on 15 January on charges stemming from a wave of violence after disputed elections in the west African nation in 2010.Around 3,000 people were killed in the violence. Gbagbo spent seven years behind bars and had been on trial since 2016.The delay in Gbagbo’s release was because prosecutors said that he should be kept in detention pending a possible appeal against his acquittal, arguing that he would not return to the court if there was a retrial.The release conditions include that Belgium will guarantee that Gbagbo would go back to the ICC if required.He must also surrender his travel documents, report to authorities weekly, avoid contacting witnesses in Ivory Coast and refrain from making public statements about the case, court documents said on Friday.The Belgian foreign minister, Didier Reynders, said on Saturday that there had been “a request from the court to host Mr Gbagbo simply because he has family in Belgium: his second wife, a child in Brussels”.“We have concluded that it is all right for him to stay in Belgium while on conditional release,” he said, adding: “There will be surveillance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d24324dfb3999ba9e1c0e69cf6b25cc4863369b3/185_125_3238_1943/master/3238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6554957e3994985d2c5c01469dc86d9b","title":"truong duy nhat vietnam blogger radio free asia thailand","story":"Radio Free Asia editors last heard from Truong Duy Nhat on 26 January, a day after he applied for refugee status with the UN A Vietnamese blogger for Radio Free Asia has vanished after fleeing to Thailand, the news organization said on Tuesday, as rights activists voiced fear that he had been abducted.Truong Duy Nhat – a weekly blogger for the Vietnamese service of Radio Free Asia, which aims to provide news to countries that lack press freedom – last made contact with editors on 26 January, a day after he applied for refugee status with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangkok, the US-funded network said.“We are extremely concerned about the safety and wellbeing of Truong Duy Nhat,” the Radio Free Asia president, Libby Liu, said.“We hope to hear from him as soon as possible about his whereabouts and to be assured that he’s not in any danger,” said Liu, whose organization has alerted the US state department and lawmakers.Bui Thanh Hieu, a Vietnamese blogger who lives in Germany, alleged in a Facebook post that the Hanoi government felt threatened enough to abduct Nhat.The press freedom group Reporters Without Borders called on Thailand to investigate, saying the case sent an “absolutely terrifying” message to a community of Vietnamese bloggers who have based themselves out of Bangkok.If Thai authorities turn up nothing, “that means that Vietnamese agents no longer bother with international law and violate the sovereignty of a partner country to hunt down critical voices”, said Daniel Bastard, an Asia expert for Reporters Without Borders.Nhat served two years in prison starting in 2014 after blogposts critical of Vietnam’s communist leadership. He last blogged for Radio Free Asia on the prospects for change in Vietnam in light of major anti-government demonstrations in Venezuela.Radio Free Asia quoted an unnamed associate of Nhat as saying he was “arrested” as he went to an ice cream shop inside Thailand’s massive Future Park shopping mall."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/404ab9177077dc2666a767581d15f6d0d76118b9/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e43aaeea6377be0a7a7f9ef9bda8ef50","title":"uae expatriate workers marvel at mass with pope francis","story":"Show of public Christian worship considered largest ever seen on the Arabian peninsulaMarivic Sorita’s eyes filled with tears as she spoke of her daughters back in the Philippines. She has seen them only three times in the 11 years she has worked as a housemaid in Abu Dhabi. Her eldest, now 21, recently completed her studies “thanks to the sacrifice” Sorita made by the separation, sending almost all her salary back home.Maybe one day, when her 14-year-old daughter has also finished her studies, Sorita would be able to go back to Manila and be reunited with her family. But for now, she was enjoying a rare day off work for what she described as a “very, very special” occasion.Sorita, 40, was one of thousands of people packed into the all-seater Zayed Sports City stadium in Abu Dhabi to celebrate mass with Pope Francis on Tuesday, with many more outside, watching on big screens. It was the highlight of the first ever papal visit to the Arabian peninsula, and for millions of expatriate workers in the United Arab Emirates – many of them devout Catholics from countries in Asia – it was a momentous day.“I’m very tired, I had no sleep,” said Sorita who, like many of those who had secured tickets to the mass, had been up all night. “But I’m just happy to be here, to see the pope and to celebrate mass.” She rarely went to mass “There is no time, I am always working,” she said.Berna Ros, another Filipino working as a manager for an Abu Dhabi company, said seeing the pope was the “most special moment in my life. I am blessed.”Her five children, aged between nine and 25, were also back in the Philippines, but Ros managed an annual visit home. She attended mass every week in Abu Dhabi. “We are allowed to worship freely. There is no pressure from the government,” she said.The pope entered the stadium under a blazing winter sun in an open-sided vehicle, with security guards jogging alongside and a helicopter hovering overhead. People, sporting pope-branded baseball caps and waving Vatican flags that had been distributed by volunteers, pressed against barriers to catch a glimpse of the Holy Father. Most held up phones to capture a picture of the pope some thrust out babies and small children in the hope of a papal smile or wave.The 90-minute open-air mass was considered by some to be the largest show of public Christian worship ever seen on the Arabian peninsula, the birthplace of Islam. Hallelujas and chants of “Pope Francis” and “Viva Il Papa” boomed out from speakers inside and outside the stadium.More than 100 nationalities were represented among the 135,000 crowd, with about 4,000 Muslims in attendance, organisers said.In his homily, delivered in Italian and translated into Arabic with English subtitles provided on screens, Francis directly addressed many of the expatriate Catholic workers in the stadium and beyond.“It is most certainly not easy for you to live far from home, missing the affections of your loved ones, and perhaps also feeling uncertainty about the future. But the Lord is faithful and does not abandon his people,” he said.The pope – speaking in a country famous for its skyscrapers including the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai – said that Jesus “did not ask us to build great works or draw attention to ourselves with extraordinary gestures. He asked us to produce just one work of art, possible for everyone: our own life.”Charmaine Karunaratne, 78, had travelled to the UAE from Sri Lanka to visit her daughter and grandchildren who have lived in Abu Dhabi for four years. A devout Catholic, she said it was “like heaven to see the pope”, adding that she admired his focus on the poor, and his rejection of personal luxuries.Her enthusiasm was shared by Samira Ahmed Diria Bokhari, a diplomat from Tanzania and a Muslim. “I came to mark this great day of history, a pope celebrating mass in the heart of Islam. Who would miss this opportunity?”The pope’s three-day visit to the UAE was to mark the Emirates’ “year of tolerance”. On Monday, the pope and the grand imam of al-Azhar signed a historic declaration of fraternity, calling for peace between nations, religions and races, in front of a global audience of religious leaders from Christianity, Islam, Judaism and other faiths.The document said: “We resolutely declare that religions must never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must they incite violence or the shedding of blood.”Newspapers in Saudi Arabia, where churches are banned, ran pictures of the ceremonial signing by the pope and the grand imam.Before Tuesday’s mass, Pope Francis made a private visit to St Joseph’s cathedral. He was due to return to Rome later in the day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

Photograph: Aidan CrawleyEPA Theresa May, as is her wont, was short on specifics about what she wants from Dublin and Brussels to resolve the Brexit logjam but it did seem implicit from her speech to Belfast businesspeople that a time-limited backstop would dig her out of an ever-deepening hole.That was backed up by Downing Street sources who said the “indefinite nature” of the backstop was the key reason the House of Commons rejected by a massive 230 votes the EU-UK withdrawal agreement last month. “We need to see change,” said one of the sources.The British prime minister indicated she wasn’t so much rejecting the backstop, or performing a U-turn, but rather she needed a modified backstop.“I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesn’t contain that insurance policy for the future,” she said.The business people she addressed in the Belfast office of the US insurance giant Allstate could have been forgiven for being rather miffed, considering many of them went out on a limb to endorse her original withdrawal agreement and its backstop proposal.That necessitated involving themselves in the tricky business of Northern Ireland politics and annoying the DUP in particular, who view the backstop as an unacceptable dilution of Northern Ireland’s constitutional position within the United Kingdom. No business leader wants to be in such a bind, but still they supported her.May made no apologies in Belfast while offering the excuse that she could “only deliver on the commitments we have made if I can get a deal through the UK parliament”.On Thursday in Brussels, May holds her first meeting with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker since the withdrawal agreement agreed last November was soundly rejected by the House of Commons.Before Brussels, May will be at Stormont on Wednesday to meet the leaders of the North’s five main parties. Sinn Féin and the SDLP will demand that she hold firm on the current backstop while Arlene Foster and the DUP might allow that they could live with a time-limited backstop.There was absolutely no sense from her Belfast speech or from what Downing Street sources had to say that May will be producing any detailed plan to the North’s political leaders on Wednesday.Equally, no one is expecting the Brussels meeting to lead to a resolution but it was clear from her speech on Tuesday that she hopes for or maybe even expects some moderation of the EU’s current adamant position on the backstop, notwithstanding the EU and Dublin’s insistence that there is no room to manoeuvre.How that all pans out as March 29th – Brexit day – looms ever closer and closer is anybody’s guess. The message from May on Tuesday was that she wants the EU to blink.The prime minister did not appear perturbed by the prospect of former first minister David Trimble legally challenging the backstop because, he argues, it contravenes the Belfast Agreement. She said her attorney general Geoffrey Cox had made clear the backstop respected “all aspects of the Belfast Agreement”.And in words that would have pleased Dublin, she said the Belfast Agreement was “not just the bedrock of stability here in Northern Ireland” but that “its principles are fundamental to the security and success of the whole United Kingdom”.The prime minister also engaged in the impossible task of trying to please both unionists and nationalists. “A fundamental belief in the union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is part of my political heritage as a Conservative and Unionist - and that will never change,” she said.“But the unionism I believe in is one that respects absolutely the central importance of Irish identity to those people in Northern Ireland who claim it.”May was mainly in reassuring mode in Belfast. In her speech she made several references to the British government ensuring there will be no hard border regardless of the outcome of the forthcoming negotiations.“Northern Ireland does not have to rely on the Irish Government or the European Union to prevent a return to borders of the past. The UK Government will not let that happen. I will not let that happen,” she pledged.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Politicians can’t get enough of Kieran Mulvey. In their world, no other negotiator exists. From Bertie Ahern’s time to the present day, the former union boss and now retired head of the Labour Relations Commission is the go-to mediator for distressed Ministers afraid to act and frustrated Opposition leaders who want them to get on with it.The nurses are out on strike again. Tuesday marked their second full day on the picket lines. The Taoiseach is holding firm – his government can’t make an exception of the nurses and give them a pay rise without giving it across the board to all public sector employees who signed up to a wage agreement.Not good enough, thunder the Opposition.“Why not engage in mediation, Taoiseach, to create a meaningful process so that you can set in train a process that would come within the aegis of the industrial relations machinery?” suggested the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, in the Dáil. “Why not deploy somebody, for example, of the calibre of Kieran Mulvey to engage with both sides to develop such a process that would bring the Government and the unions together under aegis of the industrial relations machinery to resolve this issue?”A klaxon went off deep in the bowels.Typical. Never a nurse when you need one.No. A klaxon went off deep in the bowels of Government Buildings at the mention of Mulvey. The boffins downed their sonic screwdrivers and, when the smoke cleared, they peered into the matter transformer capsules. But, yet again, their latest attempts to clone Kieran had ended with the same, baffling results.“More Colm Brophys,” sighed a white-coated lad assistant, shaking his head sadly, looking along the glass-fronted row of identical Fine Gael TDs for Dublin South West.“Never mind,” said the professor. “The Government is shipping heavy pressure because of the Brexit, the nurses strike and the cost overruns at the National Children’s Hospital. They need as many Colm Brophys as the machine can handle so he can sit on multiple radio and TV discussion panels, ignoring the barrage of criticism while blustering amiably until the closing credits.”The work goes on. The latest plan involves not constructing the prototype Mulveys from chocolate, as it is suspected that they may be eating themselves.Meanwhile, the Taoiseach was having a tough and uncomfortable Leaders’ Questions under intense scrutiny on both the nurses and the children’s hospital. When he came to answering questions on the hospital, he found himself in the unusual and somewhat unpleasant situation of having Opposition TDs openly laughing at him. That doesn’t happen too often.(And that was before Catherine Connolly, Independent TD for Galway, tore into him for the lack of progress on providing operating theatres in Merlin Park Hospital, his lack of up-to-date information on the situation and his sidestepping of the issue by repeating old information to her and the Dáil with details they already knew months ago.)Before that, Labour leader Brendan Howlin, a former minister for public expenditure and reform, was astonished at how long to took for his successor, Paschal Donohoe, to be informed of the humongous cost overrun on the children’s hospital.“Surely as the Minister overseeing public spending, he would have received monthly, if not weekly, updates on the progress of a project of this scale and significance. Why did it apparently take three months for the Minister for Health to inform the Minister for Public Expenditure about major cost overruns in the flagship programme of the Department of Health?”Brendan was almost speechless, but not quite. “It is unimaginable that the Minister for Public Expenditure was kept in complete ignorance of public expenditure,” he spluttered.We were reminded of Paschal, who will not have been happy at his treatment in the Irish Mirror on Tuesday, where they did a mock-up photo of him, complete with little black moustache, as Manuel, the Spanish waiter in Fawlty Towers whose catchphrase was: “I am from Barcelona. I know nothing.”On Morning Ireland on Monday, he rolled up his trademark cotton wool carpet of words, explaining his version of the cost explosion and how everything will be fine in the end.“As you know now, there is a review under way of all of these systems at the moment, led by PWC, and that will yield learnings for us regarding the nature of the governance that we had there,” he declared.Learnings? Never mind Manuel, that’s like something Borat would say.But back to the Taoiseach, who said during Leaders’ Questions: “When I found out about it in November, around the same time as the Minister for Public Expenditure, I responded in the same way as other people in this House. At first, disbelief, struggling to believe how the prices had gone up again.”Snorts of derision went up from the Opposition.“Three months,” marvelled the Fianna Fáil leader, as astonished as his Labour counterpart at the length of time it took for the people in charge of the budgetary bottom line to twig that the costs were spiralling.“Were ooo asleep?” asked Michael Healy-Rae, brandishing a copy of the Dáil record from March 2017 when the rural Independents lost a motion aimed at forcing the Government to pay closer scrutiny to the building project which was already worryingly over budget.“There’s a vast crater in St James’s and, having dug themselves into this hole, the Government seems to have no choice but to keep digging and try to find a way out,” was Brendan’s conclusion. For the rest of the exchange, Mattie McGrath, who favoured the green field site option off the M50 motorway for the project, kept shouting, “black hole . . . he’s falling into the hole,” and called for the health and public expenditure Ministers to be fired.The Taoiseach fell back to extolling all the wonderful facilities the hospital will have when built (and hang the cost).“This is a hundred-year project” he cried, although he may have meant the length of time the country will finish paying for it.And then it was time once more for Leo’s Wildean Reverse.“We must never forget the value of this project,” he told the Dáil. Again.Leo’s Wildean Reverse sets Oscar’s famous line about people “knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing” on its head.The Taoiseach and his Government, it seems, when it comes to the children’s hospital, know the value of everything but the cost of nothing."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3783225.1549389688!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"this alarms us key irish americans write to may varadkar on brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe letter, which has been signed by 40 senior figures including Gary Hart, comes ahead of Tanaiste Simon Coveney’s visit to Washington this week. File photograph: Brian LawlessPA Wire A group of prominent Irish-Americans, including former US Special Envoy to Northern Ireland Gary Hart and five former US ambassadors, have written to British prime minister Theresa May and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar expressing alarm the Belfast Agreement could be jeopardised because of Brexit. The letter, which has been signed by 40 senior figures, comes ahead of Tanaiste Simon Coveney’s visit to Washington this week, where he is due to discuss Brexit with senior Irish-American figures on Capitol Hill. It reflects growing concern in US circles about the impact of Brexit on the border in Northern Ireland. “The recent decision by the prime minister and the parliament to seek to re-open the withdrawal agreement and find an alternative to the backstop has put the Good Friday Agreement into play. This alarms us,” said former Congressman Jim Walsh, the co-chair of a committee set up to protect the Belfast Agreement, noting that the United States is a co-guarantor to the 1998 agreement. “The backstop is the insurance policy that protects the Good Friday Agreement and the GFA cannot be used as a bargaining chip as the Brexit advocates search for an alternative arrangement.”Highlighting the role played by Irish-America during the peace process, it notes that pro-Brexit advocates in London have set about diminishing the importance of the Belfast Agreement “almost to the point of dismissing it as irrelevant even though it is a binding international peace agreement.”“This is an enormous mistake and only resurrects old animosities over the constitutional integrity of Northern Ireland and has already resurrected old stereotypes that do an injustice to all the people on the island of Ireland, North and South, who overwhelmingly supported the GFA in a referendum held in May of 1998,” the letter states.Among the signatories to the letter include the former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley and former governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe, the most recent ambassador to Ireland Kevin O’Malley, and senior officials who were centrally involved in the peace process during the Clinton presidency including Nancy Soderberg who was deputy national security advisor to President Clinton.Bruce Morrison, who spearheaded the Morrison visa programme, said that peace “is not inevitable in Northern Ireland.” “A border defined by customs posts, checks points and infrastructure would reshape the economic, emotional and political landscape and resurrect the memories of the border when it was militarized during the Troubles,” he said.Mr Coveney is due to attend a meeting at the US State Department on Wednesday, before attending a reception to mark 100 years of Dail Eireann in the US Capitol which will be hosted by the co-chairs of the Friends of Ireland caucus on Capitol Hill, Democratic Congressman Richard Neal and New York Republican, Peter King. Mr Coveney is also scheduled to hold several bilateral meetings with Irish-American figures in Congress. Last week, Congressman Brendan Boyle introduced a resolution in Congress outlining opposition to the reintroduction of a hard border in Northern Ireland.The resolution has now been referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for consideration. It notes that the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly in favour of the Good Friday agreement in a referendum on May 22nd 1998. It also highlights the fact that the United States is one of the guarantors of the agreement.The motion calls for the House of Representatives to express its opposition to the imposition of a hard border, “whether one that is strongly controlled by officials, police, or soldiers, or a physical barrier, between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.”Members of the Irish-American caucus in the US Capital are watching events in London closely, and several have indicated that a return to a hard border in Ireland must be avoided at all costs.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Yuri CortezAFPGetty ImagesThe imminent arrival in neighbouring countries of humanitarian aid destined for crisis-stricken Venezuela has emerged as the latest flashpoint in the struggle for power between the South American country’s two rival presidents.Colombian authorities on Tuesday detailed plans for the collection and storage of initial shipments of food and medical aid at its frontier with Venezuela ahead of talks with leaders from the opposition-controlled National Assembly in Caracas about its eventual distribution.Further shipments to be routed through Brazil and an as-yet unnamed Caribbean island have also been announced.But embattled Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro has denounced the humanitarian operation as a pretext for a military intervention by the US in support of opposition leader Juan Guaidó. He declared himself president on January 23rd in a bid to force Maduro’s populist Chavista movement from power after 20 years. He has since been recognised as Venezuela’s legitimate president by more than 40 states including most of those in the Americas.While the humanitarian situation in Venezuela is critical, Guaidó has attempted to use the foreign aid to drive a wedge between Maduro and the Venezuelan military, which has so far remained loyal to the chavista leader during the present crisis despite some high-level defections.Guaidó renewed his call for the military to defy Maduro’s opposition and allow the humanitarian help in, claiming it was necessary to prevent the deaths of 300,000 people who will die “if this aid does not get in urgently”. The collapse of the Venezuelan economy has led to dire shortages of food and medicines and provoked a breakdown of the public health system.In a speech on Monday thanking leading members of the EU for their recognition of him as president, Guaidó said the military now had a decision to make: “Whether to continue on the side of someone who is isolated, or on the other side, not only of the constitution, but also of humanity, of those who need this aid to arrive... The moment is now.”The Venezuelan Catholic bishops’ conference also joined calls for the aid to be let in “in order to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable”.Though Canada and the EU have committed funds to relief, the initial aid arriving in Colombia is mainly from the US government aid agency USAid. The Maduro regime has sought to portray Guaidó as a puppet of the Trump administration, which it accuses of trying to orchestrate his overthrow.In a speech on Monday marking the anniversary of a failed coup attempt mounted in 1992 by chavismo’s founder Hugo Chávez, a defiant Maduro again criticised the aid effort and said Venezuelans “were not anyone’s beggars” and accused the country’s “oligarchy” of lacking any dignity “to confront those from the north who treat and mistreat us with orders and counter-orders”.But while the White House has refused to rule out the possibility of a US military intervention, saying “all options are on the table”, there remains no support for such action in the wider region.At Monday’s meeting in Ottawa of the Lima Group of Latin American countries and Canada, Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland said all members of the ad-hoc body dedicated to resolving the Venezuelan crisis were against any military solution to the crisis.Brazil’s vice president Hamilton Mourão, a former general, has also ruled out Brazilian participation in any possible US military intervention, despite the admiration for Donald Trump among senior figures in the new far-right administration of President Jair Bolsonaro.“Unless some new fact that cannot be foreseen emerges I think it is very difficult to imagine that the US with no support from a coalition of other countries would unilaterally undertake a radical measure like military intervention,” says Rubens Barbosa, Brazil’s former ambassador to Washington.The diplomatic search for a solution now switches to Montevideo where Uruguay and the EU will jointly chair a meeting of the newly formed International Contact Group on Venezuela on Thursday.There is concern in the region not only that any administration that replaces Maduro on the back of a US intervention would lack legitimacy but also at how an estimated 20,000 Cuban personnel in Venezuela, many of them military and intelligence operatives, would react.Cuba has become central to sustaining the Maduro regime as it bids to prop up its closest ally whose financial aid has been crucial in alleviating the communist island’s economic slump following the loss of its last patron, the USSR in 1991. Despite the humanitarian crisis at home, Venezuela shipped 100 tonnes of relief aid to Cuba after the capital Havana was hit by tornadoes last week."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Most, though, were already self-harming and went online “to make sense of their behaviours”.What they experienced online, however, largely normalised their harming so that it became “a routine, everyday activity”, said the researchers. The children were also able to discover and share new practices and techniques.“They became motivated to engage in further harm … the exposure to other iniduals’ severe acts made them want to become better self-harmers,” the study reports.One woman, aged 19, told researchers she was left feeling one small cut was “not nearly good enough”.The researchers discovered a “sense of competition”. One woman, aged 23, said she chided herself when she saw images: “Why can’t I do it like that?”Tumblr was cited as the favoured site because it was easy to search and find images, enabled image sharing and was “not encumbered by the monitoring and intervention by other social media and microblogging sites”, said the study. Instagram also featured.What to do if you find out your child is self-harmingDr Nina Jacob, who led the research, said: “The lack of scrutiny and moderation, where you can purportedly ‘do what the hell you like’, together with perceived anonymity, meant the site was considered more authentic than alternative platforms.”One 19-year-old woman told researchers: “Kids as young as 12 can use it … and there’s a big self-harm community on there. I got sucked into it and it did sort of increase the intensity of my self-harm again.”In the study approved by the university’s ethics committee, the researchers displayed ads on 42,000 Facebook accounts, before 21 self-harmers – 18 girls and 3 boys – aged 16 to 24 volunteered for in-depth interviews.Three quarters were attracted to sites that provided self-harming images. One described them as “triggering a rush like an addictive high”.Dr Jon Goldin, vice-chairman of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “When people look up the words ‘self-harm’ they should be directed to helpful sites which offer guidance and support, not to images of people hurting themselves,” he said.How to get help | Do you need someone to talk to?Tumblr refused to say how many moderators it employed but said it had teams to quickly take down any material that violated its rules by glorifying self-harm, and worked with charities and mental health experts to provide advice that automatically popped up when people put in self-harm searches.Victoria McCullough, Tumblr director of social impact and policy, said: “Research has shown that deletion of content posted by iniduals struggling with mental health issues can have the unintended consequence of ostracising them and preventing them from seeking out the support they need. Together with government and advocacy leaders, we’re working to develop innovative approaches that help those in need.”Duty of Care CampaignState of the Union address 2019: Donald Trump delivers annual speech in Congress -

Twenty per cent of cysts disappeared entirely, while 16 per cent of cases underwent surgery.In total, 12 women were subsequently diagnosed with ovarian cancer - suggesting a risk of 0.4 per cent.But researchers said this may have been because the tumours were originally wrongly misdiagnosed as benign.The rate of other complications, such as ovarian twisting or cyst rupture was 0.4 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.Scientists said these risks should be considered against the potential dangers of surgery.The risk of complications, such as bowel perforation, for surgical removal of cysts among women aged 50-74 is between 3 and 15 per cent.The new study carried out with KU Leuven, and published in The Lancet Oncology, is the largest to date to examine the approach of “watchful waiting”.The two-year study followed 1919 women from 10 different countries, including the UK, Belgium, Sweden and Italy, who were diagnosed with non-cancerous ovarian cysts.Professor Tom Bourne, lead researcher from Imperial College London said the study suggests “watchful waiting” is suitable for most women when an ovarian cyst is initial classified as being benign, as long as the ultrasound was carried out accurately.Professor Dirk Timmerman, lead author from KU Leuven said: “Despite these surgical risks being small, if the women in this age group underwent surgery in our study then we could speculate that 29 to 123 of them could have suffered severe surgical complications.“Instead, only 96 of them underwent surgery, which means severe complications may have been avoided in between 29 to 123 women.”State of the Union address 2019: Donald Trump delivers annual speech in Congress - live Colorado jogger chokes mountain lion to death after wild cat attacked him on mountain trailMinisters pledge to clamp down on incompetent NHS chiefs Driverless cars to be on Britain\u0026#39s roads by the end of the year, government reveals Occasional cannabis may boost men\u0026#39s fertility, new study suggestsMore than 50,000 die waiting for social care while ministers delay Social media firms face multi-million pound fines under Labour plan for new duty of care lawTeenager, 19, is stabbed to death close to Prince George\u0026#39s school in southwest LondonPolice to get new powers to evict travellers from private land, Sajid Javid announcesJohn Humphrys to quit BBC\u0026#39s Today programme after 32 yearsIcons: The Greatest Person of the 20th Century - Live Final, review: hopelessly contrived celebrity debate juxtaposed queasily with real tragedyFour children under eight killed in house fire in Stafford as father \u0026#39leaps from window with baby\u0026#39 Cabinet ministers hold secret discussions on plans to delay Brexit by eight weeksFeminists not welcome in Lib Dems unless they support gender neutral toilets, says peer  Social media firms fined and forced to apologise for harms under duty of care law by Children\u0026#39s CommissionerAmber Rudd tells Theresa May to be \u0026#39straight\u0026#39 with public about the risks of no-dealComment: We must hold our nerve with the EU to get the deal we really wantMan who killed girlfriend\u0026#39s infant son by reversing car seat into him is \u0026#39untouchable\u0026#39 son of ex-Tory minister, court hearsVaping seen as increasingly \u0026#34fashionable\u0026#34 as one in three millennials take up smoking substituteEl Chapo trial: Details of drug lord\u0026#39s vast narco empire has captivated USWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/05/TELEMMGLPICT000151444214_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq5yQLQqeH37t50SCyM4-zeEYMapKPjdhyLnv9ax6_too.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"driverless cars britains roads end year government reveals","story":"Department for TransportFully driverless cars are expected to be on Britain\u0027s roads by the end of the year, it has been revealed, as the government plans to scrap the requirement for a dedicated safety driver.The change will allow the first advanced trials on any public road of self-driving vehicles without a steering wheel or human in control, in a move which the Department for Transport said will place Britain at the forefront of the technology.Until now only limited trials of self-driving vehicles without a human driver have taken place in America, and none elsewhere in Europe. The government previously said that it expects fully driverless vehicles to be in commercial operation on British roads by 2021. It is estimated that the technology will be worth £52 billion to Britain in the next 15 years. There is research which suggests that self-driving cars could slash emissions by half and improve traffic flow because they can travel closer together on narrow streets compared with those with humans behind the wheels.But the move has been criticised by those who believe is much more work to be done to make the vehicles safe enough to operate without a driver.Last year a 49-year-old woman was killed by a self-driving Uber which had a human monitor behind the wheel as she crossed the road in Tempe, Arizona.Up to a dozen separate trials have been run in Britain over the past four years in areas such as Milton Keynes, Coventry, Bristol and Greenwich, south east London.   The Department for Transport is due to publish an updated code that imposes tougher safety standards today, which include rules on data that must be collected - such as speed, braking commands and the presence of other road users.Transport secretary Chris Grayling said: Today we are updating our guidance on automated vehicle trials, cementing the UK\u0027s position as a world leader in the development and testing of this innovative technology.Department for TransportState of the Union address 2019: Donald Trump delivers annual speech in Congress - live Colorado jogger chokes mountain lion to death after wild cat attacked him on mountain trailMinisters pledge to clamp down on incompetent NHS chiefs Occasional cannabis may boost men\u0026#39s fertility, new study suggestsMore than 50,000 die waiting for social care while ministers delay Social media firms face multi-million pound fines under Labour plan for new duty of care lawTeenager, 19, is stabbed to death close to Prince George\u0026#39s school in southwest LondonPolice to get new powers to evict travellers from private land, Sajid Javid announcesJohn Humphrys to quit BBC\u0026#39s Today programme after 32 yearsIcons: The Greatest Person of the 20th Century - Live Final, review: hopelessly contrived celebrity debate juxtaposed queasily with real tragedy\u0026#39Watchful waiting\u0026#39 is best approach for most ovarian cysts, study finds Four children under eight killed in house fire in Stafford as father \u0026#39leaps from window with baby\u0026#39 Cabinet ministers hold secret discussions on plans to delay Brexit by eight weeksFeminists not welcome in Lib Dems unless they support gender neutral toilets, says peer  Social media firms fined and forced to apologise for harms under duty of care law by Children\u0026#39s CommissionerAmber Rudd tells Theresa May to be \u0026#39straight\u0026#39 with public about the risks of no-dealComment: We must hold our nerve with the EU to get the deal we really wantMan who killed girlfriend\u0026#39s infant son by reversing car seat into him is \u0026#39untouchable\u0026#39 son of ex-Tory minister, court hearsVaping seen as increasingly \u0026#34fashionable\u0026#34 as one in three millennials take up smoking substituteEl Chapo trial: Details of drug lord\u0026#39s vast narco empire has captivated USWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/05/17/artificial-intelligence-pictionary-ai-deepmind.jpg","title":"artificial intelligence deep thoughts ai pictionary deepmind","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The difficulty ranges from simple phrases like woman kicking the football, to more complex concepts like celebrating a festival.Crucially, the AI has never seen these phrases before and must either guess them from images drawn by the human player, or convey them to the human through its own series of images.The difficulty in teaching artificial intelligence common sense has proved to be one of the key stumbling blocks in developing chatbots and voice assistants that are genuinely multi-purpose.This is a first step toward exploiting common sense, said Aniruddha Kembhavi, a computer scientist who worked on the project.Fellow computer scientist Ali Farhadi added: We wanted to build an AI system that can collaborate with human beings, and at the same time is learning about how humans think, how they act...

And few can have more first-hand experience of the danger posed to that progress by Brexit.This week, Nissan U-turned on its decision to build the new X-Trail at its Sunderland plant.\u0026nbspFor Matthews, who worked his way up from an apprenticeship to become managing director at a key Nissan supplier, it hit close to home.\u0026nbspA\u0026nbsp£61m package of taxpayer-funded sweeteners offered to Nissan by the government proved not to be enough to counter the financial reality of investing in post-Brexit\u0026nbspBritain, the shape of which remains deeply uncertain. Despite its earlier assurances, the company crunched the numbers and decided it now made sense\u0026nbspto build its\u0026nbspnew model in Japan instead.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“I’m so disappointed for the plant,” says Matthews. “It’s such a pity.”Raised in Darlington, Matthews\u0026nbspdescribes himself as a “manufacturing guy through and through” with more than 30 years’ experience in the car industry.A toolmaker by trade, he is also one of the northeast’s most prominent business leaders, awarded an MBE in 2014 for the many years he has spent promoting the region.\u0026nbspWas Brexit behind Nissan’s decision not to build the X-Trail here?Before his resignation last month, he held the top job at\u0026nbspNifco, which designs and builds plastics components, and relies on Nissan for a quarter of its UK sales.In his view, the type of Brexit currently being pursued by Theresa May’s government damages the prospects not just for the UK’s biggest and most productive car factory but also the futures of tens of thousands of young people.“Nissan is such a fantastic organisation,” says Matthews. “What you don’t often hear about is the tens of thousands of people that Nissan has trained who have moved on and helped to build other companies.“As well as a car plant, they have become a talent factory. We need more companies like that in the UK because one of our biggest problems is a lack of skills. It is such a massive issue.”Created with Sketch. Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Matthews is a clear example of how the talent factory spreads opportunities far beyond Nissan’s walls and all along the sprawling supply chain down to smaller firms that support close to 40,000 jobs between them.\u0026nbspHis own career has grown alongside Nissan’s presence in Sunderland, a city that is home to some of the UK’s most deprived areas. His apprenticeship at Nifco began\u0026nbspshortly after Nissan opened up its UK plant to great fanfare in 1986.Back then, Nissan had grown rapidly in its home market and sought to export the Japanese car industry’s hyper-efficient, just-in-time manufacturing model to Europe. Now that process is in danger of going into reverse.The Sunderland plant built 5,000 cars in its first year and employed 500 people. With the new X-Trail, that was to have grown to more than 600,000 cars and more than 7,000 employees.\u0026nbspSunderland was to have become, in Nissan’s words, a “super-plant”.The X-Trail decision may make little long-term difference to Nissan, which has plants all over the world. But its smaller suppliers across the northeast will forgo future growth much-needed jobs will not be created money will not be invested.Created with Sketch.

Towards the end of these cycles\u0026nbspdecisions are made about the production of the next iteration.He points out that more investment decisions will be made as models reach the end of their lives, meaning that the full impact of Brexit on manufacturing will not be known for some time. At this point it\u0026nbspis simple enough for a global company to choose one of its other sites.Japan’s freshly inked free trade deal with the EU means that by 2027 its car exports into the world’s largest single market will face zero tariffs compared to the 10 per cent the UK will face.Nissan is not alone. Jaguar Land Rover last year announced it would transfer production of the Discovery from the West Midlands to Slovakia, which, being\u0026nbspinside the EU, has tariff-free access.Just as opportunity cascades down the supply chain so does the negative impact of decisions like these, a fact which Matthews is keenly aware of.\u0026nbspIt’s been more than two years since Nissan announced it would make the X-Trail in Sunderland and many companies will have built their businesses and their sales forecasts around the decision, he says.“Now they will have gaps in their manufacturing that they have to fill somehow, which will be a huge challenge. They will have to look to other manufacturers.”That will of course prove difficult as other firms,\u0026nbspincluding JLR\u0026nbspand Ford, have scaled back their workforces in the UK amid continuing uncertainty not just around Brexit but diesel emissions too.Going the other way up the supply chain, the Port of Tyne’s chief executive Matthew Beeton is concerned by Nissan’s decision. The lack of clarity around Brexit means it “remains difficult to plan and invest for in the medium to long term – impacting on ... ports, business and indeed the wider economic position both regionally and nationally”,\u0026nbsphe said.Despite the risks, Matthews understands why many shop floor workers still want to leave the EU and he insists that the UK’s decision to do so must be respected.“I’ve spoken to a lot of people on the shop floor. Many\u0026nbspof them want to come out of the EU regardless.“They are very frustrated with our relationship with Europe. The majority of those on the shop floor want to leave.“The\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspwho are faced with managing global businesses take a different view.”He blames the EU for the current\u0026nbsplack of certainty on Brexit as much\u0026nbspas the UK government.\u0026nbsp“I voted remain and I have been very open about that but I also respect democracy. To protect manufacturing we need some form of customs union, but not at any cost.“The way we have been treated by the EU in the negotiations has led to an\u0026nbspincrease in nationalist tendencies that is causing big rifts that will still be here 10, 20, 30 years down the line.”Ministers condemned for hiding £61m aid package for NissanIn the more immediate term, Brexit is due to go ahead next month and manufacturers\u0026nbspare still a long way short of being ready.“How can you prepare when you don’t know what you are preparing for? We are coming out in a matter of weeks and we still don’t know.”The kind of just-in-time manufacturing operated by the UK car industry requires companies having stock on hand, Matthews explains. “But companies don’t know the lead times that they’re going to face after Brexit.\u0026nbsp“How can any business plan for that? It is a nightmare.”A lot of firms are building up stocks as much as they can to prepare for no deal but the other side of that is they spend a huge amount of money on warehousing which may have been wasted, says Matthews.With all of these problems to face, will other manufacturers follow Nissan and JLR by starting to shift production of certain models elsewhere?Matthews won’t be drawn.“If we come out of the EU and secure some kind of customs union that will be very good news for UK manufacturing,” says Matthews. “But I don’t have a crystal ball.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Serbian guard commanders say they will open fire if they do. It’s Alex’s first operation and his group is vastly outnumbered on either side and so can’t physically drive the warring factions apart.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Over 48 hours we had to persuade the Kosovans not to attempt a border break and the Serbians not to shoot,” he says. “I had my troops and the Serbians looking to me. I had to keep strong. I had to keep alert and focus on the end result.”The Serbians didn’t shoot and the Kosovans retreated, teaching him the importance of keeping calm which probably isn’t taught in business studies courses but really should be.After seven years of service, which included further tours of Macedonia and Iraq, Alex returned to his native Inverness and in 2015 set up a breakfast cereal business called FUEL10K, hoping to capitalise on the trend among younger customers to ditch conventional square boxed options.His 32-strong product range includes drinks in squeezable pouches, porridge pots and cookies and are stocked in Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys and Waitrose. Every year has seen double digit growth with sales now at £8m this year and expected to hit £10m next, all from a standing start and no outside investment. Last year he was named Entrepreneur of the Year by Heropreneurs, an organisation encouraging armed forces veterans to go into business on return to civilian life.The encouraging reality of corporate social responsibilityIt’s often said we can judge a country by how well it treats its prisoners. But how we treat our veterans is equally revealing, perhaps more so, given around 4 per cent of the prison population is made up of ex-military.Alex’s journey is a remarkable one, sadly not shared by many. Having worked with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress for a number of years, I’ve heard too many stories of returning servicemen being unprepared to come back to what they left often many years ago, beginning a cycle of family breakdown, homelessness, alcoholism, drugs, crime and imprisonment. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) means for many their only weekly activity is a counselling session.Sometimes crime and homelessness are ing factors to join the armed forces in the first place.“By the time I joined the army aged 21, I had lived on the streets aged 16, ran my first business, been on the run from the police for defrauding banks and catalogues, done drugs and employed a drug dealer,” Nick Wilson tells me.In the army he found he had a family who always looked out for each other. But in 2013, on return, he set up a chauffeur company which, while successful, left him with the feeling that many business owners face of isolation: “What got me through the really bad times was that sense of survival – knowing real hard times, horrendous, shit situations experienced whilst on operational tour, those that put life in perspective. The gritted, dogged determination that you needed to get through those days, weeks, months is what will get you through business.”After two years Nick sold his business for a profit just around the time he was diagnosed with PTSD. “I was having suicidal thoughts, the pain from my spinal injury was becoming a real problem with the meds and their side-effects causing me to lose grip on reality.”In 2016 he suffered a nervous breakdown but after rehabilitation was determined not to let mental health issues ruin his life. He set up Working Minds Matter – a consultancy firm helping business with mental wellbeing in the workplace.“I think it is important for a veteran who is looking to go into business for themselves to have a better understanding of who they are as a person, what makes them who they are, their values, their beliefs, their strengths and weaknesses. They are no longer a part of a large family unit, having to follow another leader or manager, working for an organisation’s values and beliefs rather than those of their own.”I first met Nick at an event Dragons Den star Peter Jones organised last summer at Buckingham University where 20 businesspeople speed mentored hundreds of schoolkids from around the country who all had entrepreneurial dreams.Our collective worry was that the education system would slowly sap that out of them. I observed\u0026nbspto Nick was that the army instils leadership skills and\u0026nbspI was surprised that there weren’t more veteran-owned businesses.Nick\u0026nbspthen put out a competition to his network to a make a short video presentation of their emerging or aspirant business idea and the most compelling one would win a year’s mentoring with me.Created with Sketch.The new army recruitment posters Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The winner, Rob Dennison, joined the army in 2004, serving partly in Afghanistan. He still has recurring nightmares from when he visited the Helmand Province where he came across a child prostitution racket with many children lying dead. “When I returned I realised I’d gone from a high adrenalin career to nothing,” he says.He told his girlfriend that once he’d got into trouble for brewing some coffee when out on patrol and she convinced him to start his own coffee business which he’s called The 50cal Coffee Company. It will be a social enterprise – a series of cafes where veterans can not only get his own blends and brews but also have the opportunity to talk to someone in private about the problems they are facing, starting in his home town of Lincoln.In America there is much bigger public support for veterans and veteran-owned businesses than we have here. I’m hoping my year with Rob will help him get off the ground and get wider buy-in from the rest of us.It’s not just about what people like Alex, Nick and Rob have done for us in their past in the services but also for what they are able to do for us in the next phase of their lives.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And few can have more first-hand experience of the danger posed to that progress by Brexit.This week, Nissan U-turned on its decision to build the new X-Trail at its Sunderland plant.\u0026nbspFor Matthews, who worked his way up from an apprenticeship to become managing director at a key Nissan supplier, it hit close to home.\u0026nbspA\u0026nbsp£61m package of taxpayer-funded sweeteners offered to Nissan by the government proved not to be enough to counter the financial reality of investing in post-Brexit\u0026nbspBritain, the shape of which remains deeply uncertain. Despite its earlier assurances, the company crunched the numbers and decided it now made sense\u0026nbspto build its\u0026nbspnew model in Japan instead.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“I’m so disappointed for the plant,” says Matthews. “It’s such a pity.”Raised in Darlington, Matthews\u0026nbspdescribes himself as a “manufacturing guy through and through” with more than 30 years’ experience in the car industry.A toolmaker by trade, he is also one of the northeast’s most prominent business leaders, awarded an MBE in 2014 for the many years he has spent promoting the region.\u0026nbspWas Brexit behind Nissan’s decision not to build the X-Trail here?Before his resignation last month, he held the top job at\u0026nbspNifco, which designs and builds plastics components, and relies on Nissan for a quarter of its UK sales.In his view, the type of Brexit currently being pursued by Theresa May’s government damages the prospects not just for the UK’s biggest and most productive car factory but also the futures of tens of thousands of young people.“Nissan is such a fantastic organisation,” says Matthews. “What you don’t often hear about is the tens of thousands of people that Nissan has trained who have moved on and helped to build other companies.“As well as a car plant, they have become a talent factory. We need more companies like that in the UK because one of our biggest problems is a lack of skills. It is such a massive issue.”Created with Sketch.

His apprenticeship at Nifco began\u0026nbspshortly after Nissan opened up its UK plant to great fanfare in 1986.Back then, Nissan had grown rapidly in its home market and sought to export the Japanese car industry’s hyper-efficient, just-in-time manufacturing model to Europe. Now that process is in danger of going into reverse.The Sunderland plant built 5,000 cars in its first year and employed 500 people. With the new X-Trail, that was to have grown to more than 600,000 cars and more than 7,000 employees.\u0026nbspSunderland was to have become, in Nissan’s words, a “super-plant”.The X-Trail decision may make little long-term difference to Nissan, which has plants all over the world. But its smaller suppliers across the northeast will forgo future growth much-needed jobs will not be created money will not be invested.Created with Sketch.

Vape rises distinctly, a new sight on the street in the last few years, bringing atmospheric emissions to the image.

Both lower their heads, as if in acknowledgement of the difficulty of the situationI walk to the end of a long jetty by the marina. Fisherman stand at the furthest tip, waiting for a bite, looking to the horizon where faint puffs of smoke appear and vanish from factories further down the east coastDwelling spaces of the dead and the living, closer than usual, occupying the same public space, both observable in one view, the burial ground of the local church acting as a garden for the housing estate behindA walk by the River Wear is comically framed from the Wearmouth Bridge, a view unavailable to the couple, who probably have no idea they’re walking into shot. Some things just cannot be appreciated at ground level and can only be seen from aboveSomebody once wrote this on a wall. That’s all. But now it’s part of the scene, part of the view, part of the experience of walking up High Street West into town. It’s tiny and anonymous, but noticeable and affectingThree elements of the city: a flapping pigeon an austere grey tower block purchasable sexNo one will lose their\u0026nbspjobs\u0026nbspas a direct result of this decision but it provides a clue to the behaviour of international car companies post-Brexit.Car models have their natural life-cycle which is likely to be several years, explains Richard Wilding, professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield School of Management. Towards the end of these cycles\u0026nbspdecisions are made about the production of the next iteration.He points out that more investment decisions will be made as models reach the end of their lives, meaning that the full impact of Brexit on manufacturing will not be known for some time. At this point it\u0026nbspis simple enough for a global company to choose one of its other sites.Japan’s freshly inked free trade deal with the EU means that by 2027 its car exports into the world’s largest single market will face zero tariffs compared to the 10 per cent the UK will face.Nissan is not alone. Jaguar Land Rover last year announced it would transfer production of the Discovery from the West Midlands to Slovakia, which, being\u0026nbspinside the EU, has tariff-free access.Just as opportunity cascades down the supply chain so does the negative impact of decisions like these, a fact which Matthews is keenly aware of.\u0026nbspIt’s been more than two years since Nissan announced it would make the X-Trail in Sunderland and many companies will have built their businesses and their sales forecasts around the decision, he says.“Now they will have gaps in their manufacturing that they have to fill somehow, which will be a huge challenge. They will have to look to other manufacturers.”That will of course prove difficult as other firms,\u0026nbspincluding JLR\u0026nbspand Ford, have scaled back their workforces in the UK amid continuing uncertainty not just around Brexit but diesel emissions too.Going the other way up the supply chain, the Port of Tyne’s chief executive Matthew Beeton is concerned by Nissan’s decision. The lack of clarity around Brexit means it “remains difficult to plan and invest for in the medium to long term – impacting on ... ports, business and indeed the wider economic position both regionally and nationally”,\u0026nbsphe said.Despite the risks, Matthews understands why many shop floor workers still want to leave the EU and he insists that the UK’s decision to do so must be respected.“I’ve spoken to a lot of people on the shop floor. Many\u0026nbspof them want to come out of the EU regardless.“They are very frustrated with our relationship with Europe. The majority of those on the shop floor want to leave.“The\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspwho are faced with managing global businesses take a different view.”He blames the EU for the current\u0026nbsplack of certainty on Brexit as much\u0026nbspas the UK government.\u0026nbsp“I voted remain and I have been very open about that but I also respect democracy. To protect manufacturing we need some form of customs union, but not at any cost.“The way we have been treated by the EU in the negotiations has led to an\u0026nbspincrease in nationalist tendencies that is causing big rifts that will still be here 10, 20, 30 years down the line.”Ministers condemned for hiding £61m aid package for NissanIn the more immediate term, Brexit is due to go ahead next month and manufacturers\u0026nbspare still a long way short of being ready.“How can you prepare when you don’t know what you are preparing for? We are coming out in a matter of weeks and we still don’t know.”The kind of just-in-time manufacturing operated by the UK car industry requires companies having stock on hand, Matthews explains. “But companies don’t know the lead times that they’re going to face after Brexit.\u0026nbsp“How can any business plan for that? It is a nightmare.”A lot of firms are building up stocks as much as they can to prepare for no deal but the other side of that is they spend a huge amount of money on warehousing which may have been wasted, says Matthews.With all of these problems to face, will other manufacturers follow Nissan and JLR by starting to shift production of certain models elsewhere?Matthews won’t be drawn.“If we come out of the EU and secure some kind of customs union that will be very good news for UK manufacturing,” says Matthews. “But I don’t have a crystal ball.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One chart that shows why Londoners are the poorest workers in the UKLondon is over. I\u0027m so glad I leftRenters are leaving London in record numbers. Where are they going?A new survey has revealed what Britons hate the most about LondonThe cost of living in every part of the world in one infographicThe ‘Northern pound’ is “essentially a difference in the cost of living”, Mr Johnes said, and the fact that money goes further outside the capital explains why more than half (53 per cent) of Londoners said they would move away from the city and accept a lower salary elsewhere, while just 31 per cent in the North said they would consider moving. This benefits both jobseekers and employers, Mr Johnes said, because companies will find it easier to hire staff and workers will find their money goes further, even if they are being paid a smaller amount. “So it’s a win for consumers and a win for businesses,” he said. Martin Talbot, director at Totaljobs, added: “Gone are the days where a salary is enough to secure the best talent today’s jobseekers are increasingly valuing work-life balance and their wellbeing above all else. “Northern cities are seeing a rise in job opportunities as UK companies no longer think the capital is the be all and end all. Many northern cities offer lots of other advantages too, from a shorter (and cheaper) commute, great cultural scene, and a more affordable social life. “No matter where they’re based, it’s key for businesses to highlight not just their employer brand, but the lifestyle their local area can provide existing and potential employees.”However, the researchers noted that London is unlikely to be abandoned by UK workers. “London will be fine, London is still a great place to live. It has been and will continue to be a centre of gravity,” said Mr Johnes. The survey also revealed that Londoners have different priorities for spending, with 16 per cent of people living in the city taking five or more holidays per year, compared with 9 per cent in the North.cost of livingOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps.

There will be an option to report people to avoid users sending then removing harmful messages, for instance.It mirrors a tool that is available in other apps including Facebook\u0027s own WhatsApp. On that app, messages can be deleted for much longer after they are sent, allowing people more than an hour – though it was much shorter initially.Mark Zuckerberg tries to defend Facebook on its birthdayMark Zuckerberg has also had access to a similar feature for some time. Facebook claims the boss\u0027s messages disappear over time to ensure they are kept safing, citing security issues such as the major Sony hack.But users complained that it appeared to be unfair that only they were given the option of deleting messages after the fact. When it became clear Mr Zuckerberg was receiving special treatment, the company announced he would have limited access to the feature that and that such a tool would be rolled out in the coming months.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the same year, the company\u0027s shares dropped 30 per cent.\u0026nbspJosie Cox\u0026nbspexplains how\u0026nbspit got there and where it\u0027s going nextClick to followThe IndependentApple Park, the new headquarters in Cupertino designed by Lord Norman Foster, cost roughly $5bn, and will house 13,000 employees when everyone has moved inFor an interview published in the\u0026nbspFinancial Times\u0026nbspback in 2006, journalist Richard Waters hauled himself to a nondescript corner of the Californian city of San Jose to meet with a corpulent computer scientist called Steve. As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s. In a world of instant gratification, it’s becoming clear that he who fails to innovate is lost. Perhaps, just perhaps, that will prove Apple’s greatest obstacle yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Debate in the European parliament is a joke. Neither system is perfect, but they can learn from each other, writes Jon Stone\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentFarage and Jean-Claude Juncker: the former Ukip leader is a master of the grandstand-to-viral-video formulaThis is not the House of Commons, this is the European parliament.” These were the words deputy speaker Mairead McGuinness used on Wednesday to tell off former Ukip MEPs shouting down another member during a debate in Brussels.The Brexit crisis has put the House of Commons in the international spotlight more than ever, and the chamber ides opinion. To some like McGuiness, the Commons’ boisterous atmosphere and over-the-top shouting is a sign that MPs do not take things things seriously. It is criticised as being an archaic, hostile environment that disadvantages anyone who doesn’t take a macro approach to politics – often women.Others speak highly of the drama of Britain’s mother of parliaments and sigh wearily at the dour debates in other legislatures like the European parliament. Many foreign observers who watch the Commons for the first time are captivated. An amazed American friend once genuinely asked me whether he was watching footage “from a movie”. Prime minister’s questions features regularly on US political channel C-Span and makes far more appearances there than any other foreign legislature – because it is so watchable.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI covered Westminster for years and made the jump to Brussels in 2017. I arrived with high expectations of the European parliament, expecting a modern legislature that was rationally designed rather than evolved through the centuries. Not every expectation was met: after a year and a half of working in the EU capital I believe Brussels is better than Westminster in some respects – but worse in others.Let’s start with the bad: what passes for “debate” in Brussels is a joke, and beyond awful. In Westminster the format for asking questions to a minister is designed to put them on the ropes – they get quizzed by their opposition counterpart and have to give an answer immediately after they are asked. Then there are follow-ups. Backbenchers can raise questions afterwards. If the minister doesn’t give good answers, they look stupid or evasive. It is not uncommon for answers to be newsworthy sometimes unintentionally.Drop Brexit red lines to ‘avoid backstop’, EU parliament to urgeNot so in Brussels: first, MEPs ask their questions. Then, after all the questions have been asked, the commissioner does a single summing up speech in response where he picks the questions he likes and pretends uncomfortable ones didn’t exist. There is practically zero scrutiny applied, and the system incentivises MEPs to do a piece of grandstanding to camera, so their clip can be shared on Facebook later and get 17 likes.\u0026nbspSome MEPs are better at exploiting this dynamic than others. Pro-Europeans in the UK would do well to remember that it was the European parliament, not Westminster, that gave Nigel Farage his platform to rail against the EU. The former Ukip leader is a master at the grandstand-to-viral-video formula: one extended clip of him insulting former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy (“You have all the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk.”) is perhaps the single most popular clip in the history of the Parliament. It has several million views across dozens of different uploads on YouTube and other streaming sites and made Farage an overnight celebrity across the world – catching the eyes of US news channels where he is now a regular fixture and an ally of Donald Trump.Created with Sketch.The Royal Gallery, Houses of Parliament — in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery Queen Elizabeth II  is accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as they proceed through the Royal Gallery before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster in 2014.The Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsChina\u0027s President, Xi Jinping addresses MPs and peers in Parliament\u0027s Royal Gallery in 2015.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech in the Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament as Britain\u0027s Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow listens Yeoman of the Guard, wearing traditional uniform walk through the Royal Gallery during the ceremonial search before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsIndia\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery at the Houses of Parliamen in 2015.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery Queen Elizabeth II  is accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as they proceed through the Royal Gallery before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster in 2014.The Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsChina\u0027s President, Xi Jinping addresses MPs and peers in Parliament\u0027s Royal Gallery in 2015.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech in the Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament as Britain\u0027s Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow listens Yeoman of the Guard, wearing traditional uniform walk through the Royal Gallery during the ceremonial search before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsIndia\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery at the Houses of Parliamen in 2015.Furious rhetoric has become a cottage industry: other typical video titles include “‘Who the Hell do you Think You Are?’ Nigel Farage throws egg in Eurocrat faces”, “Nigel Farage: I want you all fired!” and “‘You Are a TERRIBLE Leader’ – Nigel Farage Tells Angela Merkel Everything To Her Face”. In some ways the dynamic of the parliament’s broken debates has undermined the European project itself and allowed shouty populists to differentiate themselves in a field where reasoned debate is always overshadowed by grandstanding.EU rules Gibraltar is ‘colony’ of BritainEU agrees to give UK visa-free travel even after no-deal BrexitJeremy Hardy’s best jokes: From Brexit to right wing hypocrisySenior Conservative latest to admit Brexit could be delayedThe minimal time allocated for debates in Brussels is also a serious problem that prevents serious discussion. Often, only the leaders of the European parliament’s political groups get time to speak – backbenchers are often omitted altogether, even on big issues. When regular MEPs do get a word in, it will only be a handful of them. Even the group leaders are regularly told by the chair to hurry up – we don’t have all day. A massive basketball-style clock with red lettering looms over MEPs telling them how much speaking time they have used.\u0026nbspThis is unforgiveable, and it need not be this\u0026nbspway. The limited speaking time is a function of the fact the parliament barely sits – the main chamber is usually in use for around four days a month, with occasional extra “extraordinary” sessions lasting two days. The Commons, by contrast, sits over twice as many days – even though MPs tend to have more intensive constituency duties than MEPs do. It would be easy to find more time for proper debates if only the parliament actually met more regularly.Westminster has its fair share of ridiculous spectacles: mock hostage-taking during the state opening of parliament, £80,000 animal skin parchments, and the magic mace (don’t pick it up!). But none of these traditions are as bizarre and disruptive as the monthly caravan of MEPs and their staff marching from Brussels to Strasbourg. For the unfamiliar: the European Parliament’s main offices are in Belgium’s capital, but because of a historical quirk and a whole lot of politics, it conducts most of its main sessions in France. To give you an idea of how sensible this is, the transport infrastructure between the cities is so poor that the fastest way is actually to go on the train via Paris (the parliament, in fact charters special TGVs from the French national railway company for some staff). If you’ve ever looked at a map you’ll appreciate that this makes no sense: Paris is 400km from Strasbourg, and not in the right direction.France has an effective veto on ending the practice, and even Emmanuel Macron, for all his alleged reforming zeal, wants to keep it. The situation is so inconvenient that the parliament’s secretariat actually offers to pay expenses for journalists to come to Strasbourg to encourage some to show up. It is, at least, a lovely city – certainly worth a visit or 12.It should be clear that the European parliament is absolutely not the ideal legislature of some British pro-Europeans’ imaginations. And yet, there is a lot that Westminster could learn from itIt should be clear that the European parliament is absolutely not the ideal legislature of some British pro-Europeans’ imaginations. And yet, there is a lot that Westminster could learn from it.\u0026nbspThe overall EU legislative process is notoriously long and convoluted, but the legislative scrutiny the parliament provides is generally very good: independent committees of MEPs and rapporteurs scrutinise laws coming from the commission and council, and all MEPs get a binding vote on their recommended changes, which are often substantial and well thought-out. Elections by proportional representation mean the commission presidency never really has an absolute single-party majority and the law-making process is genuinely consensual – it is harder to railroad through legislation than in the UK.\u0026nbspSome of the nuts and bolts of how the European parliament works are also very impressive to someone used to the 16th century practises still operating in the Commons. MEPs vote electronically, which means it takes about 10 seconds to process a vote. In Westminster a single amendment will take 15 minutes because all 650 MPs have to physically go and stand in a room together to be counted: the present system of having two ision lobbies dates back to 1835 but a similar system, which used only one lobby, dates back to at least 1584.You might think that the fact MEPs speak dozens of different languages from 28 countries would be a problem, but this is actually dealt with very well. The translation set-up is practically one of the wonders of the modern world – everyone can talk and listen to everyone else in their native language. Sometimes MEPs choose to speak in English: some are better than others, and the language barrier makes genuinely inspiring rhetoric sparse, though some does occasionally shine through.What will happen to Britain’s MEPs if Brexit is delayed?What Britain’s last ever MEPs are planning to do after BrexitIn many respects the European parliament is also far more open than Westminster. If you want to report on the House of Commons in person as a journalist, you need to be a member of the press gallery. This requires a parliamentary security pass, of which there are a limited number for journalists, with a set allocation for established publications. It is hard to get one, they are jealously guarded, and the whole system is very much a closed shop.\u0026nbspIn Brussels anyone who can prove they are a bone fide journalist can get a pass that gives them access to the EU institutions: a letter from your editor and samples of work will do. This thankfully made it easy for The Independent to set up shop here, but it also means there are far more freelancers, upstart publications, and smaller specialist outfits catering to interested audiences. Given the technical nature of a lot of legislation the EU deals with, having specialists on hand is crucial: it’s good for scrutiny, and it’s good for democracy. There has been some movement in the UK to allow new publications into the press gallery, but the issue is contentious and the process of who is allowed in is not always transparent.\u0026nbspSpecialist reporters are usually confined to newsrooms for lack of parliamentary passes – while in Brussels agricultural subsidy specialists wander the halls freely with financial services reporters and health policy correspondents.Created with Sketch.

This is not the case in Brussels: because of the way the EU is set up, the parliament plays second – or even third – fiddle to the European Commission and European Council, which are a short walk away and where most journalists congregate. The most important daily press briefing in Brussels happens at the commission, in an auditorium, on camera – while in Westminster it is done in an obscure wood-panelled room, up too many staircases, on semi-anonymous terms.\u0026nbspThe European parliament has gained more powers and importance in recent years, but it cannot yet claim to be a fully-pledged legislature – notably it lacks the ability to actually suggest laws known as legislative initiative. But in practice in Westminster there is little legislative initiative from the backbenches anyway: the UK’s broken private members’ bill system, where practically every law is talked out or “filibustered” even if there is a majority for it, means that the government has a very firm grip on the statute book indeed.Some differences between Westminster and Brussels are a matter of taste: Westminster, notably, sits in a gothic palace, while the parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg are modern glass, steel, and concrete – both styles have their fans and detractors. In one way, though, the two places are more similar than they might like to admit: it notably is very easy to get lost in both, thanks to a shared history of repeated extensions, badly connected annexes, and endless nondescript corridors.There is no really answer to which parliament is better: they can both learn from each other. And really, they both need to.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are major differentials.”Meanwhile, tenants in Manchester pay an average rent of £496, against £1,053 in the capital. One chart that shows why Londoners are the poorest workers in the UKLondon is over. I\u0027m so glad I leftRenters are leaving London in record numbers. Where are they going?A new survey has revealed what Britons hate the most about LondonThe cost of living in every part of the world in one infographicThe ‘Northern pound’ is “essentially a difference in the cost of living”, Mr Johnes said, and the fact that money goes further outside the capital explains why more than half (53 per cent) of Londoners said they would move away from the city and accept a lower salary elsewhere, while just 31 per cent in the North said they would consider moving. This benefits both jobseekers and employers, Mr Johnes said, because companies will find it easier to hire staff and workers will find their money goes further, even if they are being paid a smaller amount. “So it’s a win for consumers and a win for businesses,” he said. Martin Talbot, director at Totaljobs, added: “Gone are the days where a salary is enough to secure the best talent today’s jobseekers are increasingly valuing work-life balance and their wellbeing above all else. “Northern cities are seeing a rise in job opportunities as UK companies no longer think the capital is the be all and end all. Many northern cities offer lots of other advantages too, from a shorter (and cheaper) commute, great cultural scene, and a more affordable social life. “No matter where they’re based, it’s key for businesses to highlight not just their employer brand, but the lifestyle their local area can provide existing and potential employees.”However, the researchers noted that London is unlikely to be abandoned by UK workers. “London will be fine, London is still a great place to live. It has been and will continue to be a centre of gravity,” said Mr Johnes. The survey also revealed that Londoners have different priorities for spending, with 16 per cent of people living in the city taking five or more holidays per year, compared with 9 per cent in the North.cost of livingOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead, our compasses are pointing ever closer to Russia as the magnetic pole drifts away from the Canadian Arctic and towards Siberia. The pole is now travelling about 34 miles (55 kilometres) a year. It crossed the international date line in 2017 in its lurch eastwards.As a result, scientists have been forced to issue an update on the status of Earth’s magnetic field a year ahead of schedule to enable precise navigation by those that depend on compasses rather than GPS navigation.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe constant roaming of the pole is a problem for compasses in smartphones and some consumer electronics. Aeroplanes and boats also rely on magnetic north, usually as backup navigation, said University of Colorado geophysicist Arnaud Chulliat, lead author of the newly issued World Magnetic Model. GPS is not affected because it is satellite-based. The movement of the magnetic north pole “is pretty fast”, Dr Chulliat said. Arctic summers at hottest temperatures for 115,000 years, study revealSuperbugs found in one of last ‘pristine’ Arctic wildernessesUnited Airlines’ 26-hour flight via the Arctic: What really happenedTrump reveals plans to open pristine Arctic refuge to oil drilling The shift in the pole’s location is felt more keenly in the Arctic around the north pole, meaning any vessels in the region would be hardest hit by an inaccurate model.Military organisations often depend on where magnetic north is for navigation and parachute drops, while Nasa, the Federal Aviation Administration and the US Forest Service also use it.Airport runway names are based on their direction toward magnetic north and their names change when the poles moved. For example, the airport in Fairbanks, Alaska, renamed a runway 1L-19R to 2L-20R in 2009. Modern navigation systems use declination - the difference between true north and where a compass points - to help correct where they are pointing. Declination depends on accurate magnetic field models.Scientists at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration along with those at the British Geological Survey tend to update the location of the magnetic north pole every five years in December, but this update came early because of the pole\u0027s faster movement.The early update had been scheduled for release in January this year, but was delayed by Donald Trump’s US government shutdown.Since 1831 when magnetic North was first measured in the Canadian Arctic it has moved about 1,400 miles (2300 kilometers) toward Siberia. Its speed jumped from about 9mph (15kph) to 34mph (55 kph) since 2000. The reason the pole is not static is due to movement and turbulence in Earth\u0027s liquid outer core. The molten ocean of iron and nickel in the planet\u0027s core generates an electric field, which moves around gradually, but sometimes unpredictably.Substance that gives birds power to see Earth’s magnetic field found“It has changes akin to weather,” said University of Maryland geophysicist Daniel Lathrop, who was not part of the team monitoring the magnetic north pole. “We might just call it magnetic weather.”The magnetic south pole is moving much slower than the north. Earth\u0027s magnetic field is getting weaker around our planet, leading scientists to suggest the north and south poles will eventually swap polarity, like a bar magnet flipping over. It has happened numerous times in the past, but not in the last 780,000 years. “It\u0027s not a question of if it\u0027s going to reverse, the question is when it\u0027s going to reverse,” Professor Lathrop said. When it reverses, it will not be an instantaneous inversion, but will take 1,000 or more years, scientists believe. Professor Lathrop said he sees a flip coming sooner rather than later because of the weakened magnetic field and because an area over the South Atlantic has already reversed beneath Earth\u0027s surface.

Thus, the post-crash recession of 2008 was less severe than it might have been.Under the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, the UK and Denmark were the\u0026nbsponly EU member states relieved of the requirement to join the euro once certain economic conditions were in place, for example on government borrowing and inflation (the “convergence criteria”).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThat treaty was eventually subsumed into the Lisbon Treaty of 2007. The European Commission states: “The treaty does not specify a particular timetable for joining the euro area, but leaves it to member states to develop their own strategies for meeting the condition for euro adoption. Seven of the 13 member states who joined the EU since 2004 have already joined the euro area, most recently Lithuania on 1 January 2015.” The UK and Denmark’s “opt-outs” are still in force.The question now arises, then, of whether this special situation would continue of the Brexit process, under article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, were now paused or revoked (ie reversed).What’s behind the latest Brexit row over Gibraltar?The short answer to that is yes. The UK would remain, as now, a member state under existing terms. Including the euro opt-out.However, if the UK were to formally leave the EU at any point, even under a “soft Brexit” and remaining in the European Economic Area, the single market or customs union, it would still need to reapply for membership in the usual fashion if it wanted to return. Just as, say, Albania or Serbia are now, the UK would become a “candidate” for accession.This would require acceptance of the “acquis communautaire” – all the rules, regulations and laws of the EU as they currently stand. Any exceptions would have to be agreed by the EU.Created with Sketch.

In the process of construction, when all the parts aren’t put together and fully formed, the ride and the flag and the worker look pathetic and comical.

There the Bank of England would be represented along with the other central banks.In due course, when the convergence criteria had been met, the UK would then join the euro and abolish the pound, first in bank deposits and then in notes and coins. However, it is interesting that Sweden maintains that it is not obliged to join the euro, and would only do so after a referendum. It has been an EU member since 1994 and still uses the krona.The UK joining the euro would be a controversial question, as it was when it was a live issue in the 1990s.If history is any guide, and with acknowledged flaws in the eurozone’s governance, joining the euro would be a significant obstacle to the UK rejoining the EU, if the EU insisted on enforcing it. Critics would claim it would mean bailing out Greece or Italy at great costs. Supporters would point to how it would make cross-border trade and price transparency much easier.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

financial support is finally released – more than two years after\u0026nbspNo 10 insisted had been no ‘special deal’Click to followIndy PoliticsMinisters have been condemned for keeping secret a £61m aid package for Nissan to build new cars in the UK after Brexit, after insisting there had been no “special deal”.Greg Clark, the business secretary, came under fire as he announced the Japanese giant would have to reapply for the cash, after its shock decision to abandon production of the X-Trail SUV at its Sunderland plant.A letter revealing the package – originally set to be up to £80m – was finally released, but only “after the press had got hold of it”, senior Conservative MP Nicky Morgan protested.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free

May’s deputy spokesperson had insisted\u0026nbsp“there was no special deal for Nissan”.Labour said the letter also revealed “strong assurances that manufacturers would still be able to trade without barriers” – pledges broken, it said, by the prime minister’s determination to leave the EU customs union.‘Nobody’ in Brussels considering giving May concessions she needsEloise Todd, the head of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “This Brexit bribe has come back to bite the government.”Ms Morgan, writing in her capacity as the Conservative chairwoman of the Treasury select committee, demanded to know why Mr Clark had kept secret “direct financial assistance from the government to Nissan”.“How much of the £61m is not going to be paid over?” she asked, during a Commons statement on the controversy.Ms Morgan also demanded to know why Nissan had apparently been allowed to “decide that something is still commercially sensitive, two years after the event”.Created with Sketch.Brexit

response, Mr Clark revealed that only £2.6m had been paid out so far – “about half for training of the workforce and half for environmental improvements to the plant”.And he told MPs: “Of course, the company will need to resubmit on the grounds of the new information that it has.”That new information, which emerged over the weekend, is that production of the X-Trail will be moved back to Japan, a decision partly caused by the Brexit crisis, the company said.The decision is a further blow to the UK car industry, following recent moves by Ford, Jaguar Land Rover and Honda to reduce their workforces and cut costs.Mr Clark said the decision meant that 741 planned extra jobs would no longer be created at Sunderland – although there were “no implications for existing jobs”.Pro-Brexit Tory MP refuses to back down over false Twitter claimWas Brexit behind Nissan’s decision not to build the X-Trail here?UK ports to wave through EU goods without checks after no-deal BrexitWhat is the Malthouse compromise and will it solve the Brexit puzzle?Mr Clark, who has hinted he will resign if the UK looks like crashing out of the EU without an agreement, added: “No deal is fully acknowledged, certainly by me and the industry, as being ruinous for our prospects.”The controversy blew up on a day when:* It was announced that UK ports will wave through goods from the EU without checks if there is a no-deal Brexit, to avoid huge traffic jams.* It was revealed that the prime minister will hold talks with business leaders in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, and its political leaders the following day.* Lord Trimble, the former Northern Ireland first minister threatened to take the government to court over the Irish backstop, claiming a breach of the Good Friday Agreement.* Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, raised hopes in Downing Street by saying a Brexit deal could be agreed if people were “creative” and if “there’s enough good will”.* A poll found that 45 per cent of voters back delaying Brexit beyond the scheduled date of 29 March to allow time to negotiate a better deal.Mr Clark defended the secrecy on the grounds that Nissan had been promised the aid would only be revealed “when the company said it was no longer commercially sensitive”.It was offered in return for a decision to build the Qashqhai and X-Trail models at the flagship northeast plant. The first car will still be built there.At the time, Mr Clark had said: “There is no question of financial compensation over tariffs because we have said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector, and we are going to get the best deal possible.”Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour’s shadow business secretary, accused the government of planning “managed decline’, saying: “Of course Brexit was not the only reason but it was pretty prominent in Nissan’s decision.”She said Mr Clark’s “quiet opposition to no-deal Brexit is of course well known, but still the juggernaut of government chaos hurtles on.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They also pointed to downturns in activity in 1998, 2001 and 2003 that failed to materialise.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Tories need to show they’re above that.We don’t agree with much of Nick Boles’s plan for a Brexit so soft as to be barely Brexit at all.

So why lie Some people have been asking this weekjail is the best punishment for a speeding fine. But let’s be clear: She is not going to prison for speeding — she is going to prison for perverting the course of justice by lying about who was driving her car.That would be bad enough for an average citizen. But Onasanya is not an average citizen. She is a solicitor — and also an MP.An MP is known by the title ­“Honourable” for a reason: There is a code of conduct outlined for MPs which includes, among other things, integrity and honesty.Any MP has even more obligation than the average person to set a good example and to take responsibility for their actions — both of which she has failed, spectacularly, to do. She has acted asshe is above the law, which is simply not acceptable for someone whose job is to uphold the law.She no longer deserves the privilege of representing anyone in the legal or parliamentary system and it is clear to any right-thinking ­person that she should be struck off as a solicitor — and resign as an MP.It is her refusal to do this immediately which is the most astonishing thing about this story.That, plus Corbyn’s lack of ­leadership in not insisting she resign as soon as she was found guilty.By all accounts, it sounds like she was out of her depth as an MP from the get go. For a start, constituents complained she was uncontactable.She also spent £, of taxpayer’s money in seven months on “expenses” and was caught on video ­pretending to snort “cocaine”, which isn’t exactly a great look for an MP.The trial judge concluded the “truth comes a very distant second to your personal ambition, doesn’t it ”Whether or not that’s true, it is hard not to conclude, in the face of the evidence against her, that her refusal to resign as an MP is rooted in the £, salary it yields.But how is she going to help her constituents from prison One argument being made about her being sent to jail is that she is clearly not a danger to society, which is true. But the problem for the courts is thatyou take an oath to tell the truth, then fail to do so, it has to be considered a serious offence — and punished accordingly.Without a deterrent to stop people lying through their teeth, the justice system would collapse.Let’s face it, there is nothing about this story that makes Onasanya look good.She is going to have an ­electronic tag when she comes out.No doubt she is massively regretting not owning up to speeding in the first place — and taking the consequences.Her le is now in tatters.But resigning as an MP now might help her claw back a tiny bit of respect for finally doing the right thing. As a solicitor and an MP, she needs to take full responsibility for her actions.IT’S shocking that Bonita Baxter, a heavily pregnant woman with a serious heart condition, was forced to sit on an AE floor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for five hours after patients and visitors refused to give up their seats.Clearly, manners are no longer important to this nation.But the real issue is that the hospital was so overcrowded that, given the five-hour wait, no one was going to give up their seat.AE departments continue to be overcrowded in part because we continue to abuse the NHS, turning up to AE for anything from drunkenness to a broken fingernail.Anyone who has ever had to pay for their healthcare, as they do in North America, would respect our health service much, much more.In the meantime, we need to put measures in place to make sure that people start valuing what they have.There should be fines for people who don’t attend GP and hospital appointments.And AE should start turning away anything other than genuine emergencies.T’S heart-breaking, isn’t it, ­listening to Vicky Pattison blaming herself for the fact her fiancé, John Noble, had “grown close to” other women during a boys’ trip to Dubai “When something like this happens, you blame yourself and I did question myself. MaybeI was thinner he wouldn’t have done what he did,” she said on TV on Wednesday.Apparently, this charmer actually blamed her – and her size – saying that he was “set up” to cheat because of it. Vicky, darling,you are reading this: It’s not your fault he cheated. And no amount of dieting would have stopped him.A cheater’s always going to cheat.You need to take some time out to focus on yourself and decide not to be around people who make you feel bad about yourself. There is so much pressure on women today.There is so much emphasis on how they look and how other people see them, rather than a focus on real values, like the size of your brain.So I suppose it’s easy to understand how Vicky concluded that her appearance might be the “problem”.When the reality is just that she picked an a***hole to go out with.I ABHOR fat-shaming, and rudeness. And I have zero sympathy for the woman who refused to sit between two overweight passengers on a United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New York.She caused a horrible scene and loudly called them “big pigs”, which is truly shocking.But luckily the shame was all hers, as her tirade went viral on social media – and she was thrown off the flight.It’s also true thatyou book a flight then you are entitled to the seat you’ve booked, andsomeone is taking up half of yours that’s not fair.But this issue should be dealt with by the airline, not passengers.Many airlines have an “obesity policy”. American Airlines, for example, requires passengers to purchase a second seatthey need a seatbelt extension and their body “extends more than one inch beyond the outermost edge of the arm rest”.I can imagine it’s a dficult and embarrassing rule to enforce – but it’s better than people taking matters into their ownhands.For once, I can say I did not stray, not even so much as once.THE Europeans screaming that the Irish backstop must remain are deluded.No Deal will affect Europe as much as – and in some cases, more than – the UK.And when the French farmers realise they can’t get their cheese across the border before it rots, and the Spanish – who sell more goods and services to the UK than it buys – are stranded with decaying goods, and when German car sales slump because tarfs make them too expensive, I predict riots across Europe.And then Michael Barnier will have a small dose of the pain he has inflicted on our PM.The reality is that citizens of these European countries, whose jobs will be under threat by No Deal, will not give a hootthere is or isn’t a hard border in Ireland.And frankly, all companies collect VAT for the Government and PAYE for them, so why not let them do the same for tarfs and be their own custom offices The Government can audit them once every three months, then the problem is solved.APPARENTLY, dog-walking in Tehran has been outlawed by the Islamic government in a crackdown against pet ownership.Dog owners will even face penaltiesspotted carrying their pets in a car.Tehran’s chief of police, Brigadier-General Hossein Rahimi, said the ban had been introduced because dogs “create fear and anxiety” among members of the public.Ironically, my experience is that dogs create exactly the opposite reaction.But what do you expect from a country that doesn’t allow women to initiate orce, dance or report a rape .Our country might be crazy at the moment, but let’s all breathe a sigh of relief we live here, rather than there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

joining the new fleet of F- Lightning jets.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: It is with a heavy heart, but enormous pride, that we bid farewell to the Tornado from operations.This truly is the end of an era, having played a vital role in keeping Britain and its allies safe for four decades.They are flexible when flying with a mm gun for ied targets.The aircraft carry Paveway guided bombs and Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles.They can reach top speeds of Mach . and fly to an altitude of ,ft.A Tornados wingspan is ftin and the jet is ftins in .But, after so long in service, it is only right that we now look to the future.The combination of our state-of-the art Fs and the Typhoon’s new weapon systems will keep us as a world leader in air combat for a generation.Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier said: My sincerest congratulations to the Tornado Force, ing home after more than  years of continuous commitment to defeating Daesh in Iraq and Syria -

It is uniquely rooted in ties of family, history and geography.The recent past has been a moment of reflection in the UK and Ireland as we have commemorated the centenary of a series of key events in our shared history.Today those ties of family and friendship between our countries are more important than they have ever been.And I believe there is a yearning in the hearts of all the peoples of these islands for a close and trusting relationship between all of us, and an absolute horror that we should take even a single step backwards in the progress we have collectively achieved.She proposed annual meetings between the British and Irish governments after Brexit to ensure the two countries work closely together.And she added: Both the UK and the Irish Governments have already made clear that we would support the tantalising possibility of a joint UK and Ireland World Cup bid for , should our respective football associations choose to pursue this.Mrs May admitted she must face up to the fact that MPs resoundingly rejected the Irish backstop plan - which could leave the UK trapped in the European customs union.But she hinted she may not ditch the backstop altogether, saying that any Brexit deal will need an insurance policy for the future.Earlier today DUP leader Arlene Foster vowed to back the PMs dealshe succeeds in rewriting the plan for the Irish border.The DUP are crucial to Mrs Mays strategy - because she believesthey come on board and back her deal, dozens of Tory Brexiteers will follow.Today Mrs Foster told the BBC: If the backstop is dealt with in the withdrawal agreement, then despite the fact that we may have misgivings around other parts of the agreement, we will support the Prime Minister.Because we do want Brexit to happen in an orderly fashion.The unionist boss said the current backstop would have to be replaced by a dferent way of keeping the Irish border open.She promised to lobby Mrs May on the issue when they hold talks in Belfast tomorrow.She said: We will be reiterating our opposition to the current backstop. And the fact that Parliament has now backed that position means that she has a clear mandate to go back to Brussels.The current backstop is toxic to those of us living in Northern Ireland, and indeed for unionists right across the United Kingdom, because it would cause the break-up of the United Kingdom into the medium and longer term.Mrs May got a boost from Angela Merkel yesterday as the German leader called on Brussels to be flexible with Britain.And a grand committee of Tory MPs from across the Brexit ide is meeting civil servants for a second day of talks on how to find alternative arrangements which could replace the backstop."},{"url":null,"title":"corbyn second brexit referendum frankenstein","story":"In a huge blow for Remainers who hope that the Labour boss will eventually throw his weight behind another Brexit vote, the uncovered video shows him slamming the bloc.And he mocked the idea of a second referendum too, saying he had a feeling theyre going to keep on voting to get the answer they want after Ireland narrowly rejected adopting the Lisbon Treaty, a video unearthed by the Red Roar revealed.In a rally in  he branded the EU as subservient to Nato and said he did not want to live in a European empire of the st century.At the event organised by the Irish Anti-War movement he said he wished Britain would have a referendum too on whether to accept the new demands from the bloc.Backbencher Mr Corbyn blasted: Under the terms of the Lisbon Treaty, Europe will become subservient to the wishes of Nato and the aims of Nato.We are creating for ourselves here one massive Frankenstein, which will damage all of us in the long run.Mr Corbyns Remain supporters think he will cave and back a fresh vote to stay in the European Union.But this video shows the Labour boss true colours - and shows that hopes he will come out in favour of a second Brexit referendum to overturn the result are incredibly slim.Even Brexiteer Nigel Farage praised the speech, saying he was a real Eurosceptic.He went on: His role will be crucial over the next few weeks.Will the real Jeremy Corbyn please stand up And SNP MP Stewart McDonald tweeted earlier: He and Farage were singing from the same song sheet, albeit from dferent ends of the political spectrum.Mr Corbyn has a long history of Euroscepticism and famously was slammed for taking a back seat in the  EU referendum.Since then hes had to walk a tightrope over Brexit to try and keep all sides of his party happy.BRITAIN should continue allow free movement in some forms after we leave, Sir Keir Starmer has said.In a signicant softening of Labours position the Shadow Brexit Secretary called for Britain to allign with the EU after we leave.He said people would be willing to accept free movement of people with some restrictions - like advertising a job locally first, or bringing family members over.Sir Keir told the BBC: If somebody is coming to do a job and it needs to be done and it has been advertised locally beforehand with nobody able to do it, then most people would say I accept that.Most people say thatyou are coming to join your family that is something I can accept.

Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: .

The figures we have been shown match reports in Scotlands Herald on Sunday, which said Scottish membership had dropped by a fth to just over ,.   Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney blamed that drop on a natural cycle because last year we had a leadership election. He told the BBC: As many people who are familiar with party political dynamics will know, many people join parties in order to participate in leadership elections. After we approached them with the figures today, Labour HQ sources insisted there are always members in arrears, and the number of new joiners has been particularly high in recent weeks. There are always spikes in people joining during general elections, which then lapse in between elections, a Labour source said.Membership has more than doubled since  and the Tories wont even ulge their membership figures - estimated at around ,. Last year it was revealed that the Conservatives receive more funds from the dead than from living members.We put our figures, including the regional breakdown, formally to the Labour Party to respond before publication. A spokesman replied: Labour is one of the largest political parties in Europe, made up of over half a million members, who are working to transform our society for the many not the few.

His name-calling has included referring to Low IQ Maxine Waters, Crying Chuck Schumer, Little Marco and Crooked Hillary. President Trump has also referred to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas - a racist reference to her Native American ancestry. During a press conference during his Presidential campaign he made fun of a disabled journalist by mimicing his voice and body movements.And within months of Trump coming to power, there were reports of an uptick in bullying in American schools , which has been widely attributed to his rhetoric.  In December Joshua Trump was allowed to change his name after being bullied for several years because of his name. Joshuas mother, Megan Trump, said the bullying started when Donald Trump began his presidential campaign and has become worse since. She told HuffPost: He said he hates himself, and he hates his last name, and he feels sad all the time, and he doesn’t want to live feeling like that anymore, and as a parent that’s scary.   Joshua was taken out of school and home-schooled for a year after the bullying started, but is now back in school using his fathers surname, Berto. The State of the Union is the US Presidents annual speech to congress, where he updates lawmakers on his priorities for the coming year. Traditionally the President and First Lady invite several members of the public to sit in the Senate Gallery during the speech as his guests - often referring to them directly in the speech. Its unclear whether the President will do so.

Alarm bells were ringing at Amber Peats school just months before she was found hanged in a hedgerow, the hearing was told. Concerns about the teenager, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, were reported to a safeguarding team at her local council. These included claims she had made to teachers at school that she had been forced to wash every pot in her house as a punishment. The inquest has heard she was also made to wear baggy tracksuit bottoms to school because she forgot to wash her school clothes. A second call to the team listed a series of alleged incidents reported by Amber to her form tutor that had happened at home, one of which was a claim her stepdad Danny Peat had woken the schoolgirl at .pm and made her clean the floor of their house.   However, on neither occasion was Amber’s case escalated to the level of formal social care involvement, the hearing was told today. This led to coroner Laurinda Bower saying she was ‘concerned’ about how the system operated. Amber’s body was discovered in June , three days after she walked out of the home she shared with mum Kelly, stepdad Danny, and two younger siblings. The inquest into her death has heard how she ran away from home following a row with her parents over chores. The hearing, which is being held in Nottingham, was earlier told her parents waited almost eight hours before they finally reported her missing in the early hours of the morning. Ms Bower was told two calls were made from Queen Elizabeth School in Mansfield, which Amber attended at the time of her death, to MASH before the tragedy – one in September , and another six months later.  Both times a worker took information from the callers – one of which was a key worker at the school and the other its vice principal - and handed it on to a qualied social worker. But the inquest was told the case didn’t pass a “threshold” that would have triggered statutory social services intervention. The coroner told MASH group manager Teresa Godfrey: “In the world of safeguarding there should have been an explicit conversation about risk.” The first call to the safeguarding unit was made by Queen Elizabeth vice principal Karen Green. Ms Green said she knew the Peats had been involved with a similar team in Derby, where they used to live, adding: “This family has moved around quite a bit and people have started to work with them and as soon as they start to work with them, the family move.”  The teacher added Amber had mentioned a “big secret” at home she wasn’t allowed to talk about – which turned out to be her stepdad had been jailed for tax fraud – and that she had been subjected to the pot washing punishment. The inquest was told that Ms Green said: “This one is ringing alarm bells. It just does not feel right. My gut instinct is there is something not right here and I can’t put my finger on it.” A second call was made to the MASH team in March , two months before Amber’s death, by her school key worker Sharon Clay. She reported concerns over Amber wearing ill-fitting tracksuit bottoms to school, which the inquest has previously heard she was made to do by Mr Peat after failing to put her normal trousers in the wash, and bringing her items in a cheap plastic bag.  Ms Clay added that she thought Amber was being “emotionally abused” by her stepdad, who had also ordered her to wash the floors at .pm at night. MASH worker Joanna Shepherd, who took the call, said “you would need more incidents over a period of time” – adding she was not aware at the time of the “bigger picture” surrounding Amber. But Ms Bower askedany thought had been given to the impact it could have on Amberthe disclosures she’d made to her teacher were passed back to her parents, adding: “As we discuss this now, do you see the concerns I am raising ” Mrs Shepherd replied: “Yes. But I could not question the social worker on that.” The hearing was told that since Amber’s death procedures had been put in place, including better recording systems, that aimed to gather and collate information better. The inquest continues.

Michael Seed, , is said to share the same gait as a burglar in a wig captured on CCTV during the poundmillion raid over the  Easter Bank Holiday. Seed was allegedly the brains behind the burglary, disabling the alarm, allowing the elderly villains to enter the vault, Woolwich Crown Court was told. Six men drilled in to take gems, cash and gold worth pound.million. Five have been convicted over the raid: Brian Reader, , John Collins, , Daniel Jones, , Carl Wood, , and Terry Perkins, who died last year aged .  CCTV cameras captured Basil in a blue boiler suit and disguised with the wig and mask, as he walked in through the main door of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit, Central London. Comparing that with covert footage of Seed, a shypodiatrist saw “strong evidence” to suggest they are the same man, said prosecutor Philip Evans QC. Mr Evans told jurors: “He concluded the ‘Basil’ footage showed someone with a particular habitual walk or gait, an abnormality in his right leg.” He said  items of jewellery shypotentially stolen from the Hatton Garden were found in Seed’s one-bed council flat in a raid in March . Officers found precision drills, a smelting machine and jewellery, gold, watches and gems valued at pound,.   Anti-surveillance gadgets and gold ingots like ones linked to Jones were also found at the Islington flat, where Seed lived alone just two miles from the diamond district, the court heard. Jurors were told he has no known income and was unemployed from , paid no tax and took no benefits. Recordings of Jones, Collins and Perkins supported the claim that Seed is Basil, the court heard. Jones was said to be referring to Seed’s “frugal lestyle” when he said gold, cash and “foreign money” from the raid would last Basil “forever, Tel, that will last him right through, he goes for the cheapest gaffs”. Another plank in the prosecution case is surveillance photos of Seed meeting Collins twice in the weeks after the burglary, the court heard.  Mr Evans also outlined “striking and compelling” similarities between Hatton Garden and a second high value raid Seed is charged with. The Chatila jewellery store in Bond Street was attacked on August Bank Holiday weekend in . Seed is alleged to have disabled two alarms, allowing four raiders to swipe around poundmillion worth of jewellery, along with pound, in cash. “These two offences required very specialist skills and knowledge,” he said. “The prosecution suggest that Mr Seed is one of those people.” Seed denies two charges of conspiracy to commit burglary and one charge of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property. The trial continues.

The Duchess of Cambridge met with youngsters as she popped into a London secondary school to mark Childrens Mental Health Week. She also said how she is passing her passion for the arts on to her children - saying Prince George had been inspired to draw using a piece of charcoal he found in a fireplace at home. She met Andria Zafirakou, who has been named the worlds best teacher, at Alperton Community School in Brent - and told her about her love of tie dye. During her visit to the art class, the Duchess said she was desperate to use the printing technique - fashion mainstay of the hippie generation which was taught to countless children in schools during the s and s.  When Ms Zafirakou explained the dferent types of printing taught in her classes, Kate said with a laugh: Im desperate to go back to tie dye. When askedshe was interested in art, the Duchess, who studied History of Art at university, said she loved it adding: Its something Im loving doing with the children - papier mache - I forgot how messy it is, but its really great. She also said her son George had found a piece of charcoal in a fireplace and told her: Mummy Im going to draw a picture - thats whats so nice you can do it from all around you. Earlier, Kate produced a treasured family photo when she joined a group of primary schoolchildren asked to take in an object that makes them happy.  She took the image used for her  Christmas card, showing her with the Duke of Cambridge and their three children, George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. The Duchess joined the pupils during a visit to Lavender Primary School in Enfield, north London. Ms Zafirakou, who was awarded a million dollarsin prize money and the  Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize, praised the royal visit to her school. Commenting on Kates admission she does art with her children, she said: So shes a very hands on mum who understands about being creative - its just brilliant and lovely to hear that and as a mother myself I know exactly what that means.  She stressed how the school supports not only the pupils academic aspirations but their personal development. Our approach is that were not an exam factory type of school, we do look at the childrens well-being and prepare them for their futures and also how to look after themselves, she said.

There are  spots for the new devices in North West England, including Sefton, Knowsley, Liverpool, Wirral and St Helens. However, although the places are accurate, only a handful of the cameras are active, the Liverpool Echo reports. This means that motorists can only get caught in two of the listed locations so far. Speed on green cameras not only detect when a driver has jumped a red traffic light signal, but also record the speed of those vehicles travelling above the speed limit through a junction, regardless of the colour of the traffic light signal. A number of suitable junctions have been earmarked for the ‘speed on green’ cameras with Sefton, Merseyside, being the first area to receive them.   During the trial period, the two locations in Sefton will have active speed on green cameras - meaning drivers could get caught out at the Crosby and Maghull locations. The rest of the locations on the list wont be activated until later should the trial go to plan. This new type of camera records a drivers speed at traffic lights is currently being trialled on the streets of Merseyside. The temporary scheme is part of Merseyside Polices strategy to reduce the number and severity of injury collisions and to reduce the overall speed of vehicles on the regions roads. Merseyside Road Safety Partnershiphave introduced speed on green cameras at some of the countys junctions.   Each junction will be clearly signposted as a speed camera for the locations across Merseyside.

The couple, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, had been to pregnancy hypnobirthing and yoga classes before the birth. They believe that is what kept Sonal supremely calm throughout. Sonal said: In my classes, I was told to envisage the place I wanted to give birth. Obviously, I didn’t exactly visualise a car birth.  “I was so calm that the midwives told me not to come into hospital. Even my husband didn’t believe I was in labour and he didn’t even stop the car for the birth. “We were driving down the main road and the next thing, I was holding a baby boy in my arms.

The customer had allegedly claimed she was a police officer and that her human rights were violated when staff refused to give her a free round of drinks when she dropped the previous round on the floor. She later took to TripAdvisor to claim that the pubs staff had taken a disliking to her group and had an issue with happy people, Bristol Live reports.In his scathing riposte, landlord James Aylfe asked the woman, Hows the head this morning , and claimed she had been kicked out of the Hobgoblin pub in Bristol. His reply is serving as another example of bar and restaurant owners hitting back at bad reviews.   The woman, registered on TripAdvisor as ‘Chloe A’ posted on the public review website on Saturday night after allegedly being kicked out of the venue.Her review was headed ‘unreasonable’, and complained the bar staff took her for being drunk, even though she said she wasn’t. She explained how she and four friends had entered the pub but her stay did not last long. “The staff took a disliking to us the second we walked in,” she wrote. “We are a group of five who haven’t seen each other since uni. “They told us we were too drunk despite not having any alcohol before entering the establishment. This pub clearly has an issue with happy people,” she added. At least that is the best interpretation of what Chloe A wrote on TripAdvisor, Bristol Live reported.She actually tapped in: “The staff good a disliking to use the second we walked in. We are a group of  who haven’t seen us since uni. They told us we were too drunk despite not having any alcohol before entering the establishmst. This pub clearly has an issue with happy people.” Hobgoblin owner James saw the review the next day, and claims he immediately recognised who Chloe A was from the night before. He decided to respond to set the record straight, and also back up his staff, who were allegedly left upset by the experience of dealing with Chloe.   James response on TripAdvisor began inquiring after her health, before saying she might not be able to remember exactly what happened. He explained things began well - she was served a round of drinks with no problem. But then Chloe A’s time in the Hobgoblin took something of a downward turn almost immediately, because as she carried them back to the table, she spilt all the drinks after ‘stumbling away from the bar, barging into another customer’ And it was at this point, according to James, it started getting a little weird, and rather unpleasant for the staff behind the bar. She ed to the bar and ‘aggressively demanded’ replacement drinks for free, James wrote. “At this point you began threatening a member of bar staff,” he wrote, followed up by a scathing remark. “You claimed to be a police officer and that you could arrest the member of staff . “You threatened tothe following day with senior officers to pursue this further and suggested that we were infringing on your human rights,” he added. But James went on to explain the effect this behaviour had on staff and other customers. One member of staff was reduced to tears, other customers complained about her behaviour, he said. And when the assistant manager asked Chloe A to leave, she was not going to go quietly. According to James, she ‘continued to remonstrate aggressively with my assistant manager threatening all manner of consequences, demanding he hand over the full names of the staff who had refused to serve you so you could sue them for breaching your human rights’. “So the thing is Chloe,what you say is true and you really werent drunk when you arrived, then what you are asking us to accept is that these are the actions of you as a sober person,” he added, before ending by stating he was ‘completely comfortable’ with how she was treated by his staff, and suggesting that she should perhaps come to the bar with an apology. Since he posted the response on the pubs Facebook page, it has gone viral. Bristol Live has messaged Chloe A, but is yet to receive a response. James said he took the decision to share his response as a show of support for the staff involved. We dont get many one-star reviews, in fact I think hers was the just the third, so mercully we havent particularly suffered from reviews like this, he told Bristol Live . I didnt want to make a big deal about it, but I didnt feel I could just leave it unanswered. What has been really nice is that the response from customers has been almost universally positive - its been really nice to see, and nice for the staff, becauseyou get a slightly unpleasant experience it can knock your confidence in dealing with people. What was also good was that a number of people commented that they were there and that the staff did really well and acted properly, he added. James Aylfes response in full Hi Chloe, Hows the head this morning  Id be surprisedyou can actually remember your behaviour last night so, just in case its a little foggy, lets have a recap, shall we  Although you were initially served a round of drinks, after you stumbled away from the bar and barged into another customer, dropping your drinks on the floor, we began to realise that you werent *entirely* sober. This assessment was further strengthened when you ed to the bar, aggressively demanding that your spilt drinks be replaced for free. You were refused. At this point you began threatening a member of bar staff. You claimed to be a police officer and that you could arrest the member of staff . You threatened tothe following day with senior officers to pursue this further and suggested that we were infringing on your human rights. In the cold light of this morning these were rather obviously the angry ravings of someone well in their cups but as funny as it sounds now, you were extremely aggressive and intimidating at the time. A number of other customers commented that your behaviour was inappropriate, and you reduced the member of bar staff to tears. Once we had discussed what had happened, we decided that frankly it would be bestyou all moved on and we informed you that we wouldnt be serving you any further. Instead of leaving quietly with your friends you continued to remonstrate aggressively with my assistant manager threatening all manner of consequences, demanding he hand over the full names of the staff who had refused to serve you so you could sue them for breaching your human rights. So the thing is Chloe,what you say is true and you really werent drunk when you arrived, then what you are asking us to accept is that these are the actions of you as a sober person. Im really not sure that paints you in a particularly flattering light either way and I am completely comfortable with how you were dealt with last night. As for where we go from here, Ill leave that up to you. Id suggest contrition and heartfelt apology as a bare minimum requirement to you being served here againbut you are, of course, free to seek to enforce your *ahem* human rights in the courtsyou are so determined.

It means Sophies skin and clothes can be completely drenched in just a few hours. Sophie, of Houston, Texas, USA, admits it also made nights out and dating a nightmare.  She said: If Im out with friends, I make frequent trips to the bathroom to dry my armpits using a hand-dryer I sweat so much that Im pretty much always uncomfortable, but winter is by far the worst time. Its really horrible at the moment, because Im sweating just as much but the sweat runs cold. I have to dress up warmly, but I know that the sweat will start to soak through the layers, which then starts to freeze making me even colder.

She said: I call myself the Sweat Bender, after Uri Geller the Spoon Bender because I have this ability to make my hands sweat really fast just by thinking about sweating. Its like a kind of superpower, although possibly the worst superpower in the world. My friends enjoy watching it though.   But Sophie has not always found it easy to make light of her condition, which mainly affects her hands, armpits and feet. She said: I have broken my computer and my phone because of water damage, and I also really struggle to drive because the wheel slips around in my hands. I had also considered a career in medicine, but I know thats something that probably isnt an option for me - because who wants to be examined by someone with clammy hands, let alone hands dripping with sweat  Sophies parents, William, , who works for the space agency NASA, and stay-at-home mum Heidi, , realised she was stickier than her playmates. When she was two Sophies cousin, Emily, then aged four, refused to hold her hand, saying it was too gross. But, as William was also prone to sweating, they were not overly concerned, assuming she was like her dad until she reached school age, when they realised her problem was causing her embarrassment and discomfort.Single Sophie who was diagnosed when she was eight, said: I was constantly having to dry my hands on my clothes at school , to the extent where theyd always be wet. Id leave puddles on my work and kids wouldnt want to get anywhere near me. Things came to a head when Sophie was humiliated in front of her classmates by a teacher who askedshe had had an accident, on her hands as she was so wet. She said: Obviously, at that age, all the kids laughed and it was very upsetting for me, as an eight year old, to be made fun of in front of so many people. Her parents took her to see a doctor and she was diagnosed with primary hyperhidrosis, an inherited disorder that begins in childhood and normally affects only certain areas - in Sophies case, her hands, feet and armpits. She has tried ious treatments, including iontophoresis where the hands are placed in water that is connected to an electrical current, but none have been effective. Unable to find a cure for her condition, Sophie - who cannot afford Botox treatment, which can be very effective, but costs ,for each six-monthly session - found ways of adapting. She said: I began carrying sweat rags around with me all the time and would only wear very particular kind of clothes.  Youll never see me wearing a grey T-shirt and I only ever really wear white and black, which make sweat marks less obvious. Im careful to feel all of my clothes before I buy them, too. I need something that I can dry my hands on throughout the day that wont show up the moisture marks. An introverted youngster, because of her condition, she felt isolated from her peers until she joined secondary school and met a group of friends who were far more understanding and accepting of her unusual complaint.Sophie, who also has eczema on her feet because of her condition, said: When you have a disorder like mine that you cant control or stop, you can either let it make you miserable or start to own it.So I started to own it, openly telling people about hyperhidrosis and how it affects me. I think people respected that. Sometimes though, her openness about her hyperhidrosis has caused her problems.  Sophie said: I once told someone I was on a date with about it - as I always do whenever I meet someone - and he took it fine, but then kept on referencing it and making jokes about it throughout the date. I was thinking: Can we just move on  I dont like the fact that people often define me by it.Nevertheless, her hyperhidrosis is not something Sophie wants to hide from and she has created an account on the picture-sharing site Instagram to discuss openly her condition.She said: I feel like I have to embrace this, not to shy away from it and pretend like everything is fine. Im going to spend my le living with this - so I have to face up to it.

The student, of the University of North Carolina in the US, was freaked out after items in her room started disappearing and hand prints were left behind on the bathroom wall and mirror. But the young woman, known only as Maddie, discovered there was no ghost - instead, a cross-dressing man had been in her room, taking her clothes. Police, who were called to the scene in Greensboro, said the student had found a man in her clothes going through her closet. Maddie spoke with the local Fox station, but didn’t want to be fully identied.   The college junior said: “I’ve been having like pieces of clothes missing. Like shirts and pants. Items were disappearing and hand prints were left behind on the bathroom wall and mirror. But it was not until Saturday that she uncovered a mystery that she and her roommates thought was a ghost. She claimed to the channel: “I just hear rattling in my closet. It sounded like a raccoon in my closet. “I’m like who’s there  And somebody answers me. He’s like ‘oh my name is Drew.’   “I open the door and he’s in there, wearing all of my clothes. My socks. My shoes. And he has a book bag full of my clothes.” The police arrived and later confirmed the alleged cross-dressing ‘ghost’ was Andrew Swofford. The -year-old appeared in court on Monday via video conference from the Guilford County Jail. Maddie called her boyfriend, but she said she had to calmly talk to the suspect to keep him distracted until help arrived.   “He tries on my hat, she alleged. He goes in the bathroom and looks in the mirror and then is like ‘you’re really pretty, can I give you a hug ’ she recalls. “But he never touched me.” An investigation is now underway to establish how the suspect apparently got into the flat. Incredibly, it is not the first time strangers were in there. Maddie said recently she found two strange men in her lounge. She told Fox: “There were two guys in the living room.” The locks were changed after that, but somehow Swofford is alleged to have gained access. Maddie and her roommate say they’ve now had enough.   She said: “Last night I did not feel safe. I slept with my roommate in her bed. “I can’t stay here. My closet, it stinks. Every time I go in my room there’s a bad vibe. I’m just ready to leave.” Burkely Communities, the property management company, told FOX they are going through all of the details and trying to figure out how something like this happened. Previously, Swofford had been jailed in Guilford County under a , bond on  felony charges including larceny and identity theft.

Defensively I am trying to be better and I want to be better offensively as well.“I came here to get experience of first-team football. I was waiting for my chance at Bournemouth but I felt I could get it here sooner, get some games for the rest of the season. Hopefully I will be more readyI get the opportunity when I go back, or wherever it may be.“There is a job to do for the team as well and our goal at Dundee United is to win this league. Yes, it would be nice to be finishing the season with a medal for that.”Seaman’s time north of the border hardly got off to the perfect start and, within hours of his arrival, he was tasting defeat as United went down to Ayr.His temporary manager was disappointed with the team performance at Somerset Park but did make a point of saying the new arrival had put in some good work.The young full-back took encouragement from that but has admitted he did not necessarily agree with Robbie’s assessment.“I was happy to make my debut last week, obviously disappointed with the loss, but it was good to get out there and experience something dferent,” he added.“I didn’t think I started the game too well but I thought I grew into it. Still, personally, I don’t think it was one of my better games by any stretch.“It was my first game at the club, my first playing a dferent style of football and my first playing in dferent weather conditions and stuff like that.“It was all a learning curve, something to take from that game into future games.“I came up Thursday night, so I only had a day here before the game but I have high expectations and I like to set high standards.“When I don’t reach them, I’m disappointed.”The aim now is to show up well as he makes his home debut as Morton visit Tannadice and United try to get back to winning ways to keep in touch with leaders Ross County.And Seaman does admit this week has given him more time to do his homework on the opposition, saying: “Before Ayr the gaffer gave me a lot of clips of Ayr to watch so I had a fair idea of what they were going to do.“I was relatively ready for the game in a tactical aspect but I did only come up on Thursday night.“For this game against Morton we have been getting information throughout the week. So I’ve an idea of what to expect and I am looking forward to playing in front of our own fans.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united sign former st johnstone defender mark connolly","story":"Dundee United have signed defender Mark Connolly from Crawley Town for an undisclosed fee.Irish-born Connolly joins United on a contract until the end of season .As a youngster, he spent a season at St Johnstone and two seasons at Kilmarnock where he became club captain between two separate periods at Crawley Town.He has represented Ireland at Under , Under  and  level.The -year-old becomes Robbie Neilson#s ninth signing of the January window and third of a busy final day.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

Gin and tonic anyone ” “Large ones all round!” To be serious though – I still can’t decide what made me angrier. The crass begging bowl letter – hoping to cash in on the biggest Burns day of the year  Or the fact that Burns Cottage has been allowed to fall into such a state that phrases like “damaged beyond repair” are even necessary  If we’re talking man’s insensitivity to man here – then last Friday’s NTS letter takes the bannock! Its contents have upset dozens of people I know – and judging by the reaction on social media, hundreds more that I don’t know. Nicky Cotter wrote: “NTS . . . put your hands in your pockets and get it fixed. If you can spend pound, on a wooden tree house at Culzean Castle – you can stump up pound, to fix one of the most historically and culturally signicant buildings in Scotland”. Spot on, sir. The NTS letter tells us that “time and Scotland’s wet winters have taken their toll”. Yes – that’ll be the  winters since Burns father William Burness built the cottage on . And during that period, it’s been thatched more times than Wayne Rooney’s balding napper. If the current thatch “has signicant tears and has worn away”, you have to askthe last thatching work was in some way inferior - orthe cottage needed re-thatched several years ago and the work was never undertaken  You then start wondering how the auld clay biggin’ managed to survive the  wet Scottish winters between the cottage being built and the National Trust for Scotland’s formation back in   The answer is fairly obvious. Back then – people looked after it! And you only have to look at the recent row over the deteriorating Burns Monument to start wonderingthe NTS is the right custodian of our Burns heritage  Burns Cottage is everything Mr Cotter said earlier . .. and more. It’s the most important building in Ayrshire – by a lang Scots mile. Every nook, cranny - and twig of its roof - should be the subject of a fingertip, annual inspection. And whatever work is required – at whatever cost – should be sanctioned immediately. In fact, I imagine that’s what ‘most people’ thought was already happening. But then we had last Friday’s mail . . . when ‘most people’ discovered to their horror that the north-west gable is starting to pull away from the rest of the cottage! If admission fees don’t cover the cost of Burns Cottage – then put them up! The last figures I have show , visitors in . Charging them an extra p would have reached the pound, required – with enough left over to putty the windows as well. So, I’m sorry, NTS. But this was the wrong letter . . . to the wrong people . . . on the wrong day.

Mark Kirkby, , almost killed passenger Kerrie Anne Monaghan when he finally crashed into a wall. Miss Monaghan was in Ayr Sherf Court on crutches to hear the sentence on her partner, who she is standing by. The court heard Kirkby did not even have a driving licence and Sherf John Montgomery banned him from holding one for four years. Depute fiscal Lindsay Bain told the court police spotted a silver Volvo being driven erratically from Barassie Street into Portland Street. The police car’s blue lights went on and Kirkby initially slowed down before increasing speed. He was hitting mph in Templehill before heading into Harbour Road. And Kirkby’s car was said to have taken off as he drove across a mini roundabout into Port Ranald Drive. He hit mph in North Shore Road, eventually crashing into a wall at the Beach Road Kilmarnock Road junction in Barassie. During the whole episode, which began around .am on October  last year, Kirkby drove dangerously through junctions and swerved round corners.  When the crash occurred the car’s airbags were deployed but this did not prevent Ms Monaghan’s horric injuries. She had to be cut out of the car by firefighters and suffered numerous fractures to her face, head, body and limbs. “Kerrie Anne Monaghan is very lucky to be alive,” said fiscal Ms Bain. The court also heard of offences committed by Kirkbywhose address was given as Barlinnie Prison, on June . This time he was in a grey Ford Mondeo around .am when police spotted the car stationary on the A near the Pennyburn Roundabout. Kirkby was unsteady on his feet and slurring his speech, although a breath test proved negative. A a blood test found substances identied as cocaine and benzocaine. Defence lawyer Hugh Duncan said Kirkby’s relationship with Ms Monaghan was still ongoing. “He accepts full responsibility,” said the lawyer. “He comes across as remorseful to the injuries his partner suffered and to potential harm he could have done to others.” Mr Duncan said Kirkby had been remanded in custody since October , had undergone a detox programme, and had come to a realisation of his mental health issues. Sherf John Montgomery told Kirkby: “You drove dangerously at high speed for an extended period. I see no option but a custodial sentence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHMP BarlinnieVolvoAyrCourtsJusticeTroon"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article11461688.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/ymr_ayp_141112Elliots_02.jpg","title":"elliots prestwick evolve rebrand vics","story":"NewsElliots in Prestwick to \"evolve\" with rebrand as Vics  The VineBosses at Buzzworks say the bar and restaurant must \"evolve\" as part of its transformation.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB NewsBuzzworks managing director, Kenny Blair, is promising bold changes at Elliots \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of Ayrshire’s biggest hospitality venues has closed for a “complete transformation”.

The bar and restaurant shut its doors on Sunday, with bosses planning to reopen at Easter as Vic’s  The Vine. Buzzworks, who have operated Elliots as their flagship in the town, say the rebrand will be split into two halves. Managing director Kenny Blair said: “It’s essential to evolve within the hospitality industry and look at innovative ways to create new and exciting concepts for our customers. “Our work to reincarnate Elliots is part of our wider growth strategy, both benefiting the local community and Scotland’s hospitality industry.” Vic’s  The Vine will feature a -cover restaurant called The Vine serving food from breakfast until late. The bar will be called Vic’s and will be a “modern take on a traditional bar”, featuring sport and entertainment. Weekend opening hours will remain at .am.  Designer Jim Hamilton is leading the project, which will include a new glass roof in part of the bar. A new kitchen boasting a churrasco BBQ pit is also planned. Bosses say Vic’s will be the first venue in Ayrshire to serve fresh, unpasteurised tank beer straight from the brewery. Kenny added: “We’ve seen an appetite in the industry for more cool and modern pubs and, similarly to our T-Bar in Ayr, Vic’s will be a traditional bar with a twist. “This will both suit the local market and sit alongside our excellent new restaurant offering in Prestwick. “Our vision is to create the best day-to-night venue in Scotland and we are confident Vic’s  The Vine will match those expectations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPrestwickAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"former royal hotel ayr sold","story":"NewsFormer Royal Hotel in Ayr is sold at auctionBuilding is branded the most dangerous in the townShareByGary Fanning:,  FEB NewsRoyal Hotel Ayr\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe former Royal Hotel, which has been described as the most dangerous building in Ayr, has been sold at auction. The iconic property, near Ayr Central, went under the hammer last Thursday. Wilsons Auctions Land and property sales executive, Lorren Mullen were managing the auction of the ex hotel. The three and a half storey building, which has lain empty for more than  years, consists of two commercial shop units on the ground floor and sandstone units above is located on Kyle Street. It had a guide price of pound,. A spokesman for Wilsons Auctions Land  Property Sales, said: “Unfortunately we cannot disclose any further detail on this property in terms of the identity of the purchaser or the sale price . “However this figure will be disclosed by the Registers of Scotland and the Ei Group in the coming months.” In May, the Post reported how plans to knock it down and turn it into a gym were rejected by councillors. Builders Dawn Developments wanted to build a new block in its place to home a gym and shops. But the plan was cut short as council planners want the hotel preserved or refurbished instead. And the sale happened after concerns about the safety of the former hotel were discussed at this month’s Fort, Seafield, and Wallacetown Community Council held at Ayr Town Hall. One community councillor said: “It is the most dangerous building in Ayr. ” It wasn’t the only empty building t discussed at the meeting. The meeting heard how young people were putting themselves in danger by gaining access to Belleisle House One said: ”If we can show concern then the council can take action and step in..” And the meeting was told how youngsters were “masquerading around” Strathdoon House.

Now the proposition has got a whole lot dferent. Pet Heaven, a crematorium for family animals, has just opened in Ayr. And businessman Forbes Robertson believes it is the answer for many families who want to give their four legged - or two-legged in the case of birds - friends a splendid send-off. No expense has been spared in an -month project at the former commercial garage site in West Sanquhar Road. Area MP Bill Grant performed the official opening ceremony last week. The lavishly decorated gilded interior includes a parlour where families can pay their last respects. Entrepreneur Forbes, who has business interests throughout the area, revealed up to  people can attend the pet funeral services . Mourners can watch as their pet recedes behind the final curtain at the close of the service, similar to what would happen in a human ceremony at Masonhill. As yet Pet Heaven cannot handle horses, but the biggest of dogs to cats, hamsters and birds. There is a tea and coffee service as well as any choice of music desired and a book of remembrance in the reception area.  Much of the interior decoration has been gathered by Forbes, a keen antique hunter and auction room collector. The company will offer a collection service as well as provide a selection of remembrance urns for ashes. It seems no expense is spared by some dog lovers in the UK and recently a couple spent pound on a full funeral including a horse drawn glass hearse. Forbes said: “People sometimes care more about their animals than humans. “A farmer who contacted me askedhis dog goes before him, the animal would be cremated here and I will store the ashes. “He told me his lawyer would be in touch as he wanted buried with his dog. “Pets are loyal, they don’t steal from you and are there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.” MP Bill Grant said Pet Heaven was a signicant investment for the area. He said: “I am sure this will be welcomed by pet owners from all over the southwest, pet owners who have lost their best friend. “To have a dignied departure for that pet who has been their friend - in some cases for  years - is a great service. “The set-up Mr Robertson has here is wonderful and I think he can be proud of it. “That last journey for pets will be full of dignity and respect from Pet Heaven and its staff. “Indeed my family had a wee dog Blackie for  years and I don’t mind admitting, then a senior fire officer, that I cried unashamedly for an hour at the loss of our companion”.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPetsSanquharAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"weather knocks out weekend shutdown","story":"NewsWeather knocks out weekend shutdown of the main ASub zero temperatures have played havoc with road teamsShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoad chiefs have axed major roadworks which would have seen the main A completely closed from pm tonight.

such as tooth decay, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.ldquoObesity, including childhood obesity, is fast becoming the epidemic of our age.ldquoMany of us are blissfully unaware just how much salt, sugar and fat is in the foods we buy.ldquoBig companies which produce, promote and retail these products are in it to maximise profits.ldquoThey have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.However, Galashiels councillor Harry Scottfelt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying:

their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for

around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull

most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

As it turned out, A Dark Carnival was the latest opus from Vanishing Point, the internationally renowned company that provides a vehicle for the dark visions of its artistic director Matthew Lenton. With Smith and A New International at its musical core, the seriousness of the project came as something of a surprise to the band.ldquoItrsquos probably fair to say the band are all sceptics, says Smith. ldquoIt took them six months to believe this was actually happening. I remember we decided to for for a walk in the Necropolis, and afterwards going for a drink, and the penny finally dropping when one of them said, lsquoYou didnrsquot tell me it was a real theatre companyrsquo. The music industry and the arts world in general does tend to attract blowhards and people who promise you the things that never materialise, so I dare say that informed their attitude.This is a fair enough assumption to make. Lenton, after all, had originally had a notion for Tom Waits to provide the score for what looks set to be an absurd and tragi-comic pop opera which goes beyond the grave to unearth a community of the dead, while angels watch from above.Things changed, however, when Lenton heard a New Internationalrsquos song, Valentino, on the radio while driving. Lenton tracked Smith down, they met, and Smith ldquostarted to become part of the world of the play.As the video to a song from the show, Necropolitan, A New Internationalrsquos flamboyant mix of nouveau cabaret with retro sensibilities was a theatrical marriage with Vanishing Point in waiting.ldquoIt was kind of a no-brainer, says Smith. ldquoI always liked theatre. I appeared in Dracula at Cumbernauld Youth Theatre when I was a raw -year old, and when I met Matt I Immediately started having ideas. I love things with a dark sense of humour, macabre, Tim Burton, Rocky Horror. Fagin always appealed. I love those songs I grew up with them. This is the first time Irsquove written for a brief, and I found that quite liberating. Itrsquos almost like yoursquore halfway through the creative process, like I had a head start. So I started writing, and couldnrsquot stop for a while.The first fruits of this unholy collaboration came a year ago with A Night at the Theatre, three bijou concert performances of the sixteen songs penned by Smith for The Dark Carnival, punctuated by short monologues written by Lenton and performed by actors Pauline Goldsmith and Peter Kelly. Since then, the show has been expanded to feature eight actors working alongside a parallel eight-member version of A New International.There has always been an innate theatricality to Smithrsquos work, ever since his early days fronting indie-pop troubadours The Starlets, who released three albums before the band morphed into A New International. This gave full vent to Smithrsquos penchant for mixing up music hall, showtunes and French chanson, all laced up with gypsy, flamenco and epic cinematic strings.ldquoWe were struggling a bit with our third album, Smith admits, ldquoso when The Dark Carnival came up it was a breath of fresh air. I love theatre that isnrsquot snobby or exclusive, and is for everyone. Thatrsquos why I love Oliver and Lionel Bart. Kurt Weill as well. Mac The Kne, people sing that at weddings and stuff. Thatrsquos filtered through to popular culture, and I like that.ldquoI think there has to be that connection, otherwise it becomes exclusive. Itrsquos one of the things Matt and I have spoken about. It would be great to get people who may not usually consider the theatre as being a good night out to come along, people who might normally go to gigs or concerts, because thatrsquos what it is. Itrsquos part gig, part theatre show, and in some small way we can try and dissolve that boundary, and have an environment where people arenrsquot afraid to sing along with the songs or laugh at the farcical moments and not be afraid of being farcical or funny. Sometimes that suggests yoursquore not being serious, but just because yoursquore being funny doesnrsquot mean yoursquore not.This is an attitude Smith has carried with him since he was a teenager.ldquoI remember going to see Elvis Costello perform solo at the Pavilion, he says. ldquoMy motherrsquos hairdresser took me, actually, but thatrsquos another story. I remember seeing him perform on his own, moving between guitar and piano, and I thought that was amazing. It just so happened there was a BBC Arena programme on either the week before or after, and that was the punk rock moment for me. Hersquos theatrical too. Itrsquos as much about his lyrics as his melodies. Irsquove always thought that melodyrsquos the thing that draws you in. Itrsquos like someone with good patter, but after that you want to know whatrsquos going on about them.ldquoBut it doesnrsquot feel like a leap to me me to be working in theatre. I remember, one of the first lightbulb moments for us as a band, wersquod been together for years at this point, trying to impersonate an indie band, but we never quite fitted in with that. We were invited to perform at literary cabarets which were a mixture of spoken word and music and suddenly realised we were probably a better fit for this audience than we were for indie venues.Later in the year, a pocket-sized unplugged version of The Dark Carnival will tour the country as part of the Touring Networkrsquos BRAW initiative. This will just feature Smith providing the music while actor Robbie Jack tells stories. Has Smithrsquos descent into full-on theatre runs on apace, has his appetite been whetted for more ldquoOh, yeah, he says. ldquoA door opened I didnrsquot know was there.Given the world The Dark Carnival conjures up, letrsquos hope that door doesnrsquot lead him straight to Hell. Smith cackles at the prospect.ldquoIrsquom already there, he says.The Dark Carnival, Citizens Theatre at Tramway, Glasgow, February -March  Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh, March - Dundee Rep, March -.

He is the godfather, but in a loving, doesnrsquot send anyone to sleep with the fishes kind of way. His latest irresistible offer to preschoolers is Moon and Me, the tale of a magical toy house whose residents come alive after dark.A preview on iPlayer created a buzz and now a series of five episodes runs every night this week.A blend of live action and stop-motion animation using low tech, hand-built puppets, Moon and Me begins with a child closing up a toy house for the night. ldquoClose your eyes, donrsquot you peep, this is the way we go to sleep, she tells her favourite doll, Pepi Nana.Once the light is off, Pepi Nana wakes up and starts saying her catchphrase: tiddle-toddle.

As luck would have it, Moon Baby, complete with a fetching blue Mohican, is in residence and only too delighted to fly down and take everyone to Storyland.A delightful mix of sights and sounds and songs that the very young will quickly warm to, Moon and Me would make ideal pre-bedtime viewing. It is intentionally repetitive, relying on familiarity to breed contentment, and the narrator, Nina Sosanya , has a voice that is made to tell stories that begin with ldquoOnce upon a time, as they do here.Moon and Me might deploy modern programme making techniques, and be based on the latest thinking on childrenrsquos language development and play - Davenport is a speech therapist by training - but it has traditional elements, too. If once upon a time ainrsquot broke, why fix it With the trail blazed by Teletubbies and In the Night Garden, Moon and Me will not cause the furore Tinky Winky and company once did, with some parents complaining the characters were spouting gibberish. Thinking has moved on from then, and there is an acceptance that children learn language more successfully through play.So much for the science bit. Story over, itrsquos time for everyone toto the toy house and for Moon Baby to blow his last kiss - what a charmer - and go home, too.If the thought occurs that the characters would make lovely toys for your own child, business is way ahead of you.

They do not just turn CO into oxygen to breathe, but their canopies trap particulates that poison our air.A study in Chicago found trees removed nearly  tonnes of pollutants every day. Some , people in the UK die early because of air pollution, according to some estimates.Another study, in Tokyo suggested that the presence of spaces such as tree-lined streets was associated with the longevity of senior citizens, as it promoted walking.As the Clyde bends round the Cunigar Loop, there is a now a boardwalk.It is routinely filled with East Enders."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-industrial-wastelands-to-be-turned-into-forests","story":"Glasgow and other towns and cities are understood to be looking at trees as a way of filling in large areas of derelict land.Urban councils have long wanted to have more woods for their citizens to enjoy ndash and to clean both their air and their ground.Every political party in Scotland has signed up to a campaign by the Woodlands Trust to plant more trees in urban areas.Now Glasgow has specically asked for the Scottish Governmentrsquos forestry strategy to have targets for planting trees on gap sites.The Scottish Government is currently crunching responses to its own wider strategy as it continues its plans to re-wood the nation.Less than one-fth of Scotland, some  per cent, is covered in trees, about half the average for European nations. Cities ndash thanks to parks and gardens, public and private ndash can be more wooded than the national average. Tree cover was measured at % or above in Perth, Inverness and Stirling.But it falls to just under % in Dundee, % in Edinburgh, % in Glasgow and just % in the city of Aberdeen.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council: ldquoThere are multiple benefits that can potentially be drawn from planting new woodland on vacant or derelict land.ldquoUrban woodland assists with carbon reduction, enhances bioersity in places which maybe otherwise deficient, helps to manage flood risk and acts as a barrier to city noise among many other positive environmental impacts.ldquoBut planting on derelict land also leads to aesthetic improvements for communities, while encouraging increased physical activity as people make greater use of previously unattractive spaces.The Glasgow spokesman said: ldquoThere are derelict sites that naturally regenerate into woodland with tree species such as birch, willow and alder commonly taking hold along with ground flora and urban wildle.ldquoWhether to pursue planting or allow natural growth would require assessment on a site-by-site basis.ldquoAn appropriate balance would also have to be struck between fostering urban woodland and ensuring development of sites could continue, particularly for housing.Experts stress the healing powers of trees - both for people and for land and air. However, city planners are also excited about the ability of small urban woodlands to protect against flooding. A  per cent rise in tree cover, they say, can reduce surface off-flow by %.George Anderson of the Woodland Trust, which champions native trees, said: ldquoWe need more trees and they donrsquot have to be in the open countryside.ldquoAside from the broad positives boosting bioersity, fighting climate change and cutting flooding, urban trees create huge direct benefits for human health and wellbeing.ldquoWe breathe easier and think happier with trees nearby.ldquoThere is huge potential for Glasgow to improve citizensrsquo lives through planting derelict land. Successive Scottish and UK governments have pursued rural reforestation, often despite opposition from those who want to keep Scotlandrsquos hill as they are, gamekeepers and mountaineers.Tree cover across the country has gone from around % at beginning of the th century to % at its end, largely thanks to commercial timber plantations and the state-owned Forestry Commission.There is currently a target to raise that area to % by . That would mean planting , hectares of wood a year, the equivalent of more than all the land currently categorised as vacant.Scotland is not always achieving that rate of growth. Last month there were suggestions public-sector pension funds should throw some of their financial weight behind reforesting."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-may-must-now-abort-her-brexit-kamikaze-mission","story":"In fact, a better wartime metaphor for her is a kamikaze pilot about to crash her plane into the Good Ship Britannia, risking all onboard.For the umpteenth time, there is no renegotiation of the Irish Border with the EU it isnrsquot up for discussion.

Doesnrsquot seem much morally right about that  As Low, quoting Eric Hobswam, puts it: nationalists donrsquot really care about anyonersquos country but their own.Aside from Brexit, there are many reasons people do not believe that there is a case, moral or otherwise, for independence: devolution has demonstrated that on a political level at least, politicians in the Scottish Parliament, of whatever party, are no more effective than those in Westminster. Our public services are in the exact same position as those in the rest of the of the UK, with the management and oversight of these bordering on inept police and fire centralisation, and a nine years council tax freeze, which has forced councils to cut services relied upon by the less well off, spring readily to mind.

The Council would make joint decisions for the UK in shared areas, giving \"proper respect and weight\" to all involved on areas such as fishing and agriculture.Askedhis proposal would give the Scottish Government a veto over UK Government decisions, the Labour peer argued majority voting could apply to the decisions of the Council, admitting that would \"seriously threaten the sensibilities of the UK Government\".He went on: ldquoIf you had these two structures in place, then after  years[of devolution] and after Brexithellipthe UK would look much more like a multi-national governmental structure, which it should be, given the legislative autonomy there now is in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The former Scottish Labour leader, who was First Minister between  and , made clear the Scotland Office - now officially dubbed the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland ndash should be abolished and noted how he was \"surprised...there was still a Secretary of State for Scotland\" following devolution in .His former Government colleague, the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Wallace of Tankerness, backed plans for a UK Council of Ministers to deal with the ldquonew reality of a strengthened devolved settlement.The former Deputy First Minister also questioned the power of the Scotland Office, telling MPs: \"I suspect[David Lidington, the Cabinet Office Minister and Theresa Mayrsquos de facto deputy] carries more clout for Scotlands interests than Mr Mundell does no disrespect to Mr Mundell.ldquoI dont think we would be have been any worse off in the early days of devolutionthe Scotland Office had disappeared,\" he declared.Following the meeting, a UK Government spokeswoman said: \"The Secretary of State for Scotland and his office play a vital role in ensuring Scotlands voice is heard at the heart of Whitehall and that the UK Governments responsibilities and activities in Scotland are fully understood.\"Elsewhere in the committee hearing, Sir Peter Housden, the former head of the civil service in Scotland, recalled how relations between senior members of the UK and Scottish Governments \"could not have been more tense\" at times during the  independence referendum campaign.John Lamont, the Conservative committee member, asked him: \"Thinking back to  and the referendum, is it fair to say that relations between the two governments were quite tense \"Sir Peter replied: \"Well, interestingly, yes and no. At senior level they could not have been more tense on occasions but nevertheless there were important channels of communication that were being held open.\"I saw it as my responsibility, with officials in the UK Government, to keep those channels open.Meanwhile, Lord Wallace claimed Tony Blair, the then Prime Minister, \"spent most of the time looking out the window\" during Joint Ministerial Committee meetings with Scottish Government leaders.He said: \"I remember meeting in Edinburgh, in Cardf and by the time it came to the third meeting in Downing Street, I dont think Im exaggerating to say that Tony Blair spent most of the time looking out the window.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost. The site is peaceful, yet vibrant, and supports a thriving marine eco-system. It is both an honour and a privilege to get to know the site.”Full details and further pictures in The Orcadian this week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It#s anticipated this work will start on February  and could take four weeks to complete.The current one-way system means drivers can turn into Castle Street from Junction Road and on into Broad Street but vehicles do not have access from Palace Road into Broad Street.A signed ersion via Clay Loan is in place. In addition, vehicles cannot turn into Castle Street from Albert Street – but can drive on into Broad Street.The works are part of the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative’sPlaces and Spaces project, which will see improvements to the area at the bottom of the Strynd, the creation of a new path to the War Memorial at St Magnus and improvements at the head of Victoria Street.The council has said the works at the top of Castle Street will see new paving and road surfacing laid, and the road surface raised to pavement level. This initial phase of the project is due for completion early May after which works will be suspended for the main summer season.Work at the entrance to Victoria Street is set to begin in the autumn, with a suspension planned, in December for Christmas shopping season.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

I must admit the arrival of the man who handled the aftermath of the  Glasgow terrorist attacks with such aplomb and dealt with the financial crisis – to which he may or may not have contributed – a year later knocked me for six. His presence fair disrupted the usual workout of  minutes of uphill walking on the treadmill while listening to New Order’s greatest hits – and they say men can’t multitask.Anyway, his arrival and the new BBC programme Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil in which David Cameron gets booted from pillar to post like a giant Ribena berry between the likes of Merkel and Sarkozy got me thinking about retirement.Not my retirement, rest easy readers, but the retirement of politicians.It seems like there’s a lot of mostly  to -something “talent” out there who are busy working on other things, side hustlesyou like, when they could still be involved in politics.Labour seems to have been hardest hit by this with the loss of David Miliband, who quit the rough and tumble and headed to the US in , not long after losing the leadership election to his bacon-butty-bothering wee brother Ed.Surely a Bros-style documentary chronicling the demise of the brothers’ relationship followed by a reconciliation and the inevitable comeback tour beckons.When pigs fly.David has gone down well stateside, and is something of a media dahling among the liberal elite in his role as president of the International Rescue Committee. He’s being touted as the next leader of a centrist political party in the UK which may give millions of people currently wandering in the political desert something to vote for.Ed, rightly or wrongly, cops the blame for opening up membership of the Labour Party to anyone willing to pay their three quid. Not a bad idea in theory, but oft cited as the principal reason the Bolsheviks led by Jeremy Corbyn were allowed to seize power. : Brexit: David Cameron doesn’t regret calling referendumCorbyn, who at  is two years older than HWSRN, and four years old than Tony Blair, yes I’ve mentioned the B-word, is living proof of the old adage “ you hang around the barbershop, you’re bound to get a haircut”.At , Blair is still seven years younger than Donald Trumpet but has the small problem of the Iraq War to contend with every time he opens his mouth. I for one can’t concentrate on anything he’s saying – and he has been speaking a lot of sense on Brexit – without a giant “WAR CRIMINAL” klaxon exploding in my head.The decision to take us to war with Iraq in  continues to haunt the Labour Party. That and the perception of taking the electorate for granted, especially in Scotland, has left them to endure years in the political wilderness. David Miliband will be hoping the public give him the benefit of the doubthe does , when he says he voted for war based on the belief Iraq did have weapons of mass destruction. He would certainly bring a bit of experience to proceedings and would be a much-needed voice of reason in these turbulent times. Quite rightly, there’s no way back for Blair but talented performers like Yvette Cooper need somewhere  to shine and a new Centrist party could be the answer. Of course, there’s a host of chancers who have ridden off into the sunset having got a bit of the old politics on the CV. George Gideon Oliver Osborne is one.The -year-old manchild was last seen chilling out in his new £ million sky-chalet in Verbier. Then there’s SirNick Clegg, , who has been telling anyone who’ll listen how nice and responsible Facebook is while he trousers a hefty sum and they reportedly pay -year-olds for access to their web activity. Excuse my prejudices but I’m not having guys who appear to dye their hair to hide the grey bits, surely an anachronism today, and, like crown green bowlers under the age of , they’re worth the watching.: Lesley McLeod: From my Westminster bubble, I helped create Brexit – and I am ashamedKnighthood-avoiding “Call Me Dave” Cameron is bound to be struggling as it’s reported he’s finally let the builders into his Cotswolds pile after  years of planning. Expect some Alan Partridge-style chat with the workies as -year-old Dave explains to Polish labourers why they may end up being sent home post-Brexit.Scotland is a dferent story, in that I’m struggling to think of anyone who used to be in politics who is a loss to the profession, HWSRN aside. Douglas and Wendy Alexander are still in their s and Jack McConnell is only  – so a new Centrist party might be attractive to a generation of former politicians who may or may not still have something to offer. That nice man Willie Rennie might even be persuaded to jump shipa Centrist party were to take off. Whether the ex-politicians want the grief of the social media circus that the job now brings is a dferent story. I haven’t mentioned any SNP politicians as they’re still in power and enjoying everything that goes with it – for now. But my point is that a schism in the Labour Party, the rise of populism – and I include the SNP in that – and the Conservatives lurching to the right towards Jacob Rees-Mogg and his mates has opened the door for a new party.As I left the gym, I couldn’t get the former Prime Minister out of my head. Does he buy his own tray bakes or have them delivered I know he’s busy with charitable projects but he’s just one of an increasing number no longer in the political arena who would bring a sense of maturity to the current shambles.

And, therefore, I think it’s in the interest of allowing an informed decision to be taken about independence that we allow some of that clarity to emerge.“Brexit is a good example of what happens when people take, in some respects, an uninformed decision about a big change. And when people, as I believe they will in due course, opt for Scotland to be an independent country, that should be on the basis of a genuinely informed decision about all of the implications and consequences.”When asked about the timing of a second vote, Ms Sturgeon said: “Well, I think we have to follow the process that is currently under way to reach some conclusion.“What that conclusion will be remains to be seen. And then take a decision based on a calm consideration of what’s in Scotland’s best interests. And that’s what I would do. So I’m not going to say right now what I think the best timing would be.”Ms Sturgeon is in the USA and Canada this week on a trade visit. Yesterday, she told an audience at Georgetown University in Washington that this year marks the th anniversary of the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament “after  years of not having a Parliament of our own.”And the emergence of Holyrood has meant that Scotland’s “international profile” has been enhanced, the First Minister added.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kalfordhame sandness shetland","story":"Offers over £,- bed bungalow for sale in Sandness.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production. Since the s, the Celtic super-group have travelled the world as musical ambassadors - with performances from as far apart as the Arctic Circle, Japan, and Germany, with regular tours to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.The Rovers first became known in the US in the s on shows like The Tonight Show, The Smothers Brothers, Mike Douglas Show, The Dating Game , and even starring in The Virginian.In the s they hosted their first of three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers Show’ and throughout the next  years their weekly television shows brought Ireland into living rooms of America and the rest of the world.More recently, their  Drunken Sailor album went viral on YouTube, made news headlines back home in Belfast and put them back on radio across North America with a new younger generation audience.A Canadian CBC producer saw the Belfast news articles about the Rovers new song and video and asked George Millar to sing his new song ‘The Titanic’ to help their telling of the th Anniversary of Titanic. The   Years triple CD broke tour sales records, while the lads ed to the small screen with three North American television specials, ‘The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland’, ‘The Irish Rovers Christmas’, ‘The Irish Rovers LIVE on St. Patrick’s Day  th Anniversary Special’, all produced in the last few years.The days of the long tours are finally coming to an end for these Irish lads as they are now completing one last world tour.

From a legal perspective, my best advice to anyone thinking of going on holiday next summer, is to take out a travel insurance policy as soon as possible. Your insurance policy might cover you all year round until the time of your holiday, which means you could be covered for a number of dferent situations ndash for exampleyoursquore ill before your holiday and have to cancel it.Make sure the travel insurance is bespoke to you and your needsldquoItrsquos definitely worth taking out a cheaper policy than none at all, however, we do advise that you go a step further and opt for a bespoke policyyou can afford to. As this will ensure your policy is bespoke to you and your needs as an inidual. Many people tend to get reeled in by the cheap travel insurance deals ndash but think to yourself, what do I need cover for  Is this policy going to be suitable for me and my family Book a package holidayldquoOver the last decade or so, wersquove seen a signicant rise in people booking holidays that arenrsquot package holidays ndash people tend to be shopping around more booking flights  hotels  transfers separately, in order to cut down cost. However, we are advising consumers to rethink this strategy, and consider booking holidays as a package deal. Itrsquos important to understand the dficulty you may run intosomething were to go wrong, and yoursquove booked each component separately. For example,yoursquove paid £ for your flights with a particular airline, and paid £ with a separate hotel provider ndashyour flight was cancelled, you may or may not get your £ back from that airline . However, there is no guarantee that yoursquoll get your refund on the hotel too, as this is a separate and standalone contract. Again, this may or may not be covered on your insurance policy, but yoursquore not going to get it back from the hotel provider regardless.ldquoIf you choose to book a package holiday, with a reputable tour operator,one part goes wrong, all components are likely to be covered. The law in this area changed only recently and the new Package Travel Directive is an even more powerful piece of pro-consumer legislation. The importance of booking a genuine package holiday cannot be underestimated, and again this is even more relevant in light of Brexit and its uncertainties.Make sure there is ATOL Protection on your holidayldquoATOL protection is extremely important, and goes hand-in-hand with booking a package holiday. For example,an airline stops trading, there is a back up fund which acts as a lsquosafety netrsquo it ensures that you canhomeyoursquore stranded abroad and that your money is safe.Pay for your holiday by credit cardPorsche vandalised in KenilworthTravelling after Brexit - how it impacts data roaming and driving abroad Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KEN | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KEN | Article Teaser\"ldquoDonrsquot lose sight of booking your package, ATOL protected holiday, by credit card.

The charity funds research into heart and circulatory diseases including the prevention and treatment of heart attacks.Marie’s daughter Zara said her mum had been delighted to have become a granny for the first time just two weeks before she died.“Mummy’s death came as such a shock to us all. We knew that heart disease ran in our family and my grandparents had had heart attacks at a young age but we didn’t expect this to happen,” she said. “Just two weeks before she died my wee nephew was born and she became a granny for the first time.

Up stepped Peter Henvey and his shot was well-struck high into the net to tie the game at -.Carryduff made the perfect response as from the restart, they moved straight upfield with Beatty getting on the ball, finding Ciaran Sherry who broke through and squared for Darragh Connolly who rose to palm into the net and restore his side#s three-point lead.Beatty and Owen McCabe added points as it appeared Carryduff were set to pull away, but St Brigid#s refused to break as John Blaney and Rory Brolly kicked scores to get them back to within three.Beatty and Finnegan traded points while Beatty added another from play to make it a four-point game with seven to play, but St Brigid#s were far from done.Five minutes from time, substitute Paul Bradley gathered Peter King#s long ball and waited for movement inside. He spotted James Smith in space and played a high ball that Smith rose to meet and brilliantly palm to the corner of the net.Again, Carryduff went upfield and found the net when Beatty put Connolly in on the right, but while his shot was destined for the net, substitute Eoin Rooney decided to make sure of it by getting his foot to it. However, Rooney was well inside the small square before the ball and the effort was correctly ruled out for a square ball.St Brigid#s took full advantage as they swept upfield and Smith thumped over a great point to level with three to play.Once more, Carryduff were able to respond. This time, Guinness created space  meters out and his shot curled just inside the post with the referee # standing right behind the shot # overruling the umpire who waved it wide.St Brigid#s still had time to save themselves, but they couldn#t engineer a score as Carryduff broke away and almost sealed their win, but Rooney#s shot crashed off the crossbar to give the Antrim champions one last chance. But with the whistle in referee Martin Conroy#s mouth, it was now or never and Brolly had to shoot from an unfavourable distance, the effort tailing right and wide as Carryduff held on.CARRYDUFF: D Ross L Toal, G Henderson, C Cunningham J McGeough , D Coogan, D GuinnessP Laverty , J ConneryR Anderson , O McCabe , P Loughran D Connolly , R Beatty , C Sherry.

I believe that the work that I set out to do is completed and that RRCANI now has a good foundation which they can continue to build on.”She added: “It is amazing what we all achieved in a relatively short period of time, most times relying just on friendships and a lot of good will. A heartfelt thank you and very well done to you all. I hope you will continue the good work with the Roma communities.”Remarkably, recipients of the email include her line manager at LORAG and the community group’s CEO Gerard Rice – both of whom Ms Long now claims were aware of her concerns. Both say they were not alerted to any concerns with the project until issues were raised by the Belfast Trust in late May .Another recipient of the email is her then fellow LORAG worker in the RRCANI project, spokesman for the Roma community of Belfast, Nicolae Nicola. Ms Long now says that he was the person charging vulnerable Roma for services, a claim which remains unproven and which Mr Nicola vehemently denies. Also copied into the email is Ms Long’s husband, Stephen Long.LORAG Chairperson John Gormley said: “We reject the claim that was broadcast on the Nolan show. LORAG had previously told the BBC Nolan Show that the first we became aware of an allegation of charging by RRCANI was through a conversation on or about  May  with Belfast Health and Social Care Trust officials. We were funded from June  to March  to provide mentoring and capacity-building support to RRCANI, in partnership with other agencies. At no time during the funding period was any allegation of charging by RRCANI made to LORAG by any of the other partners or by any LORAG staff member.”We contacted Ms Long via email but no response had been received as we went to press."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may pledges new brexit deal for northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A majority has rejected the current backstop. The EU must now accept the need for the Withdrawal Agreement to be reopened. The toxic backstop must be dealt with.\"The DUP leader said her party wanted \"an orderly exit from the EU which works for London, Dublin, Belfast and Brussels\". She added: \"It is possible but requires political will.\"This is not a time for intransigence. It is time to respect unionists and nationalists alike in Northern Ireland and deliver a deal which is sensible and practical.\"The DUP leader said she was \"encouraged\" by comments from EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney suggesting \"a hard border can be avoided in any circumstance\".\"It is important that the scaremongering about barbed wire and checkpoints is exposed as nonsense,\" she said.\"Border communities should not have genuine fears exploited with such tall tales.\"Meanwhile in Westminster, the working group bringing together senior Eurosceptic and former Remain-supporting Tories will continue its efforts to agree alternatives to the backstop along the lines of the Malthouse Compromise. Talks involving Conservatives including Brexiteers Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers, Steve Baker and Owen Paterson - along with former Remainers Nicky Morgan and Damian Green - will continue in Whitehall, chaired by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay. The first meeting yesterday was described as \"detailed and constructive\" by the Brexit department. But in Brussels there was little sign of a willingness to reconsider the Withdrawal Agreement. Mr Barnier said the deal agreed by Mrs May and the leaders of the  other EU members \"cannot be reopened\". He said the EU was \"ready to work on alternative solutions during transition\", re-stating Brussels position that the backstop had to remain in place unless and until a replacement could be agreed. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU was ready to listen to proposals to solve the border \"riddle\", but needed to hear from the UK how it thought this could be done. Mr Coveney said alternatives to the backstop were \"wishful thinking\". He said: \"The Irish protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement already allows for alternative arrangements or alternative solutions to the backstop andtheyre there they can replace the backstop. The problem is that none of those ideas around alternative arrangements stand up to scrutiny, we have certainly not seen any that have.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37785608.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/May-Belfast-visit.jpg","title":"theresa may says commitment to avoid hard border in ireland unshakeable","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She added: “We have now narrowed the issue down to the backstop, they know that’s the problem, they have been told that for some considerable time but unfortunately they are turning their face against that and it is time for Brussels to respect Unionism in Northern Ireland. “We have heard a lot about them understanding the Belfast Agreement, that they don’t want a hard border on the island of Ireland but they are quite content to build a hard border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, thereby interfering with the constitution of the UK. “That is wrong as well and they need to recognise that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"leo varadkar to meet eu leaders to intensify nodeal brexit plans","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Thursday for talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, as she seeks changes to the Brexit deal which was rejected by MPs last month..pushThe Prime Minister is expected to press the case for the Withdrawal Agreement to be reopened to replace the controversial backstop with alternative arrangements for avoiding a hard border in Ireland after Brexit.It is her first formal meeting with senior EU officials since the deal which she reached with Mr Juncker in November went down to overwhelming defeat in the House of Commons and since MPs voted for the removal of the backstop.On Tuesday, Mrs May will make a high-profile speech in Northern Ireland, where she will insist that she can secure a Commons majority for a Brexit deal that “commands broad support” in the province.She will say that it is a “concerning time” but “we will find a way to deliver Brexit” that honours commitments to keep the border open.On Wednesday Mrs May will hold talks with Northern Ireland’s political leaders including the DUP’s Arlene Foster, who has promised to tell the Prime Minister the proposed border backstop “drives a coach and horses through the Belfast Agreement’s principle of consent” and would effectively create a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Meanwhile, former first minister Lord Trimble confirmed he is considering a legal challenge to the backstop over concerns it breaches the Good Friday Agreement.Lord Trimble told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “We are exploring this possibility and we are concerned at the way in which the Withdrawal Agreement that our Prime Minister agreed actually turns the Belfast Agreement on its head and does serious damage to it.”Announcing Mrs May’s planned visit to Brussels, European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said: “As you know, what we have is a procedure involving a number of votes which have taken place in the UK Parliament“On that basis, the Prime Minister will come along to spell out to us her ideas for what happens next.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mrs May’s visit to Brussels was announced by European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas at a press conference in the Belgian capital “President Juncker has been in constant contact with her and will look forward to seeing her… to pursue these discussions.“But we have to repeat what you are aware of, that is that the EU’s position, the Commission’s position, is clear that we are awaiting once again to see what the Prime Minister has to tell us.”Downing Street said Mrs May had warned the weekly meeting of the Cabinet that the talks with Brussels would not be easy.However ministers agreed it was a “positive” development that last week’s Commons vote had made clear for the first time that Parliament would back a dealthere were changes to the  backstop.“The Prime Minister said that our objective now was to secure a legally binding way of guaranteeing we cannot be trapped indefinitely in the backstop,” the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said.“The PM said that the discussions with the EU will not be easy but Parliament has sent a clear message that a change to the backstop is the only way to get the deal approved.”Mr Juncker is to meet Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at the Commission’s Berlaymont HQ on Wednesday.In Westminster, the working group bringing together Tories from both sides of the party was continuing efforts to agree an alternative to the backstop.A meeting on Monday involving Brexiteers Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers, Steve Baker and Owen Paterson, along with former Remainers Nicky Morgan and Damian Green, was described as “detailed and constructive” by the Brexit Department.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa Villiers, Nicky Morgan, Damian Green, Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson met on Monday to discuss alternatives to the Brexit backstop But Brussels has restated its opposition to any attempt to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, insisting the backstop was the “only operational solution” to the border question.Mr Schinas dismissed reports that Commission secretary general Martin Selmayr had made an offer of legally-binding assurances that the backstop would not lock the UK permanently in a customs union after Brexit.The Times reported that Leave-backing MPs from the Commons Brexit Committee rejected the concession during a meeting with Mr Selmayr in Brussels on Monday.But in a tweet immediately after the meeting, Mr Selmayr himself insisted that “on the EU side, nobody is considering this”, adding that the MPs had been “inconclusive” when asked whether any such assurance would help get the Withdrawal Agreement through the Commons.On the EU side, nobody is considering this. Asked whether any assurance would help to get the Withdrawal Agreement through the Commons, the answers of MPs were ... inconclusive .... The meeting confirmed that the EU did well to start its no deal preparations in December .— Martin SelmayrFebruary , Mr Schinas said: “What you have read in the secretary general’s tweet is exactly what happened.”Conservative MP Stephen Crabb, who was part of the committee delegation, suggested that Mr Selmayr did not make a direct offer during the meeting, but sounded his visitors out over what impact a legally-binding assurance might have on the debate in the UK.“We talked around the idea of the letter being written into some sort of legal protocol,” Mr Crabb told The Times.“Every time someone asked himit was something he could do, he said, ‘Let me turn around the question,we were to do that would you be guaranteed to vote for the deal ’“That’s where some of the more Brexiteer members of the committee wouldn’t say.”The backstop is effectively an insurance arrangement required by the EU to ensure the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic remains openno wider deal is agreed on future UK EU trade.Mrs Foster told the Today programme that Parliament had given Mrs May “a clear mandate to go back to Brussels” and get rid of it.“Parliament’s mandate is to replace the backstop,” said the DUP leader.“The current backstop, as I have said all along, is toxic to those of us living in Northern Ireland, and indeed for unionists right across the United Kingdom, because it would cause the break-up of the United Kingdom into the medium and longer term.”In her speech, Mrs May will promise a solution “that commands broad support across the community in Northern Ireland” and “secures a majority in the Westminster Parliament”.But Irish deputy premier Simon Coveney said alternatives to the backstop were “wishful thinking”.He said: “The Irish protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement already allows for alternative arrangements or alternative solutions to the backstop andthey’re there they can replace the backstop.“The problem is that none of those ideas around alternative arrangements stand up to scrutiny, we have certainly not seen any that have.”"},{"url":null,"title":"western trust asks 86 women to repeat cervical","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No such thing exists and, from the EU perspective, we need to be very careful not to put at risk the benefits of the Withdrawal Agreement and, in particular, the transitional arrangements and the backstop.”He made the comments during a parliamentary finance committee meeting on Tuesday where he faced questions from TDs and senators about the Government’s Brexit contingency plans.We are not engaging in or planning for the implementation of infrastructure on our borderFinance Minister Paschal DonohoeFacebookTwitterSome Brexiteers have voiced their support for a so-called managed no deal, which could see the UK paying the EU for a transition period or mini deals to ease the negative impacts of the UK crashing out of Brexit.During the committee meeting Mr Donohoe reiterated the Government’s backing of the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstop.But the Dublin TD said the Government was working daily on its no-deal contingency planning, but he said they did not include plans for physical infrastructure for a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.“We are not engaging in or planning for the implementation of infrastructure on our border,” he said.In the event of a disorderly Brexit, discussions would need to be held between the UK and the Commission regarding how that would be delivered.Speech to FinPERT Committe today on Brexit preparations, the economy, customs and taxation and legislation in this area as March th approaches: https:t.co GwLenjpNCa— Paschal DonohoeFebruary , “This is the very reason we’ve been negotiating for a backstop in the first place,” he said.He was pressed by Sinn Fein’s Pearse Doherty whether he could reassure the committee that there will be custom checks on the border in no-deal scenario.Mr Donohoe said: “I am re-stating that we will not be involved in any procedure that leads to the development of checks on the border.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out. It was fortunate that the bomb in the lounge did not explode.A police spokesman confirmed that no warnings of the bombs were made. He said that the entire building would likely have been destroyedthe second bomb had gone off.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Two Down councillors have expressed annoyance over the Department of Educationrsquos rejection of proposals for a swimming pool in Ballynahinch.At this weekrsquos meeting of the South Eastern Education and Library Board Mrs Ethel Smyth and Mr Jarlath Carey said nothing less than a meeting with the minister, Lord Melchett, would achieve any satisfaction.Mrs Smyth said that the Departmentrsquos withdrawal of permission for the pool was an immense setback at a time when everyone assumed that the way ahead was clear for the construction of a multi-purpose community complex to be provided by Down Council and a learner pool to be provided by the board.Mr Carey said there was immense concern over the disappearance of what would have been a very happy exercise in joint provision. He was most annoyed that the decision had been made by the Department without consulting either the council or the board.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh and Shrigley Town Committee was given a massive confidence boost at its annual general meeting last Wednesday evening.An enthusiastic and lively audience of more than  people turned up in response to a publicity drive aimed at finding out what grassroots support the committee had in the area.The response promoted outgoing committee chairman Col Denys Rowan-Hamilton to say later: ldquoSuch a well-attended meeting makes it all worthwhile.In his opening address to the meeting Col Rowan-Hamilton traced the work of the committee in the last  months.He outlined the reasons why the decision was taken to close the community hall, which had been opened by the committee with tremendous enthusiasm by the committee only four years ago.He also reported on Killyleaghrsquos water supply problems and said the shortages of the last three years had caused more worry to some townspeople than any other single item.A new -strong committee was elected and they will meet soon to elect their own office-bearers.CROSSGAR mdash An upstairs bedroom in a Crossgar house was completely gutted when a fire broke out on Friday morning. Severe fire, heat, smoke and water damage was caused to the house at Lislea Drive.Firemen from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were sent to the scene, but encountered dficulty finding water hydrants due to the snow-covered roads and footpaths.

And ensuring that the unique needs of this part of the UK are met has been one of my chief priorities ever since I became Prime Minister.Any border that weaves its way through farms and villages, bisects hundreds of roads and lanes, and which is crossed and re-crossed by thousands of people every day would pose a logistical challenge in the context of Brexit.Prime Minister Theresa May leaving Downing Street to travel to Northern Ireland to make a high-profile speechBut when you add to those geographical factors Northern Ireland’s complex history, the dferent traditions and identities that make up its community, and the long path to peace that the people of Northern Ireland have walked over the last forty years – the challenge is even greater.Over the last two and half years, we have come a long way towards a solution that works for Northern Ireland and Ireland.We have agreed mutual protections for citizens’ rights, the maintenance of our common travel area, and set a framework for our future relationship that ensures tarf and quota-free trade and protects our close co-operation on security and law enforcement. But the UK Parliament rejected the Withdrawal Agreement because of their concerns about the backstop – the legal protocol to prevent no hard border in the event our future relationship is not in place at the end of the implementation period.I know that many people in Northern Ireland, and indeed across this island, are worried about what Parliament’s rejection of the withdrawal deal means for them.So I am here today to affirm my commitment, and that of the United Kingdom Government, to all of the people of Northern Ireland, of every background and tradition.To affirm my commitment to the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, to its successors the St Andrew’s Agreement and the Stormont House Agreement, and to the principles they enshrine – which is absolute.And to affirm my commitment to delivering a Brexit that ensures noto a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland – which is unshakable.I was  when the Troubles began and  when the Belfast Agreement was reached for all my adult le, Northern Ireland has been a central political issue. The progress of the last few decades – from the Troubles to ceasefire from ceasefire to political agreement and from agreement to active participation by unionists and nationalists in institutions that enjoy cross-community support – has been a massive achievement and a landmark in the history of these islands. From the moment I became Prime Minister of the UK, I knew that one of my most profound responsibilities was to serve the interests of the people of Northern Ireland by doing all I could to protect and sustain that progress.Third person dies after Tyrone crash Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Successive UK and Irish Governments have played their parts, often working together in close co-operation.But it has been the political parties in Northern Ireland – the UUP and the SDLP, the DUP, Sinn Fein, and the Alliance – it has been civil society groups like WAVE and Healing Through Remembering - and above all it has been the people of Northern Ireland who have achieved by far the most.Violence has not been eliminated. But it has been reduced to levels that would once have seemed impossible to imagine.Divisions remain entrenched in some communities. But many people, including those from the younger generations, are more and more interested in putting aside those isions to build a shared future.Thanks to greater political stability, Northern Ireland is now a leading destination for inward investment, with over  international businesses investing in its economic success. Employment is at a near-record high and unemployment at a near-record low. And that transformation is reflected in the image that Northern Ireland projects to the rest of the world today.It is no longer one of violence, but of dynamism and success. And the decisive moment in that transformation was the Belfast Agreement in . Its success was in allowing people of dferent traditions to feel that those traditions and their identities were respected, and that they could work together to build a successful future for all the people of Northern Ireland.It enshrined the principle that it is the ‘birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identy themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose.’And it enshrined the consent principle: that it will always and only be for the people of Northern Ireland to decide what their constitutional future should be – and that the UK Government is solemnly committed to supporting and implementing their democratic wishes. These principles are the bedrock of peace and stability in Northern Ireland.And they will forever be honoured by the United Kingdom Government.A fundamental belief in the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is part of my political heritage as a Conservative and Unionist – and that will never change.But the Unionism I believe in is one that respects absolutely the central importance of Irish identity to those people in Northern Ireland who claim it.And the United Kingdom I stand for is an open and tolerant union of nations and people.A country where every religion, every peaceful and democratic creed, has a place and every man and woman is equal before the law, treated with respect and has the opportunity to get on and succeed. Indeed, that Union can only ever be secure and prosperit is built on that respect and acceptance of dference and ersity. Because the Belfast Agreement is not just the bedrock of stability here in Northern Ireland, its principles are fundamental to the security and success of the whole United Kingdom.Our absolute commitment to those principles has informed and directed my approach to Brexit – from my first speeches as Prime Minister to my first meetings with the Taoiseach.And in December , in the Joint Report we agreed with the EU, we committed to protect the  agreement ‘in all its parts…and to the totality of the relationships set out in it.’…‘to the avoidance of a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls’…and ‘to preserving the integrity of the UK internal market and Northern Ireland’s place within it.’These were commitments made in good faith. Our preferred approach has always been to deliver them through the Future Relationship.But I accepted the need for an insurance policy or bridging arrangement to guarantee no hard borderthe Future Relationship was not in place in time. And that such a policy had to deliver legal certainty – through what is called a legally operative text - so it would give people and businesses on both sides of the border clarity and confidence over how these commitments would be fulfilled.That is why I agreed to the backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement. And unlike the original European Commission proposal, it did not impose a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Many people, businesses, farming organisations and voluntary groups in Northern Ireland agreed with me. They spoke out in support of the Withdrawal Agreement and they defended the backstop. I know that wasn’t an easy thing to do and I am grateful to them for doing so. I fought hard to make the case for the deal as it stands. I believed it could command a majority in the House of Commons.But I have had to face up to the fact that in its current form it cannot. And the need for changes to the backstop is the key issue. While there were those in Northern Ireland who spoke in favour of it, it is also true that the backstop is not supported by the two main Unionist parties here.And this also influenced MPs in England, Scotland and Wales in voting against the deal. I can only deliver on the commitments we have madeI can get a deal through the UK Parliament.And meetings with MPs across the House showed that I can only get a deal through Parliamentlegal changes are made to the backstop.And that is why the UK Government – and a majority of MPs from across the House of Commons - supported the amendment from Sir Graham Brady last week. It reaffirms our desire to leave with a deal and our commitment to no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. And as Sir Graham himself set out, it would mean replacing the backstop with another arrangement which avoids a hard border or making legally binding changes to the backstop to introduce a time limit or create an exit mechanism.I know that the prospect of changing the backstop and re-opening the Withdrawal Agreement creates real anxieties here in Northern Ireland and in Ireland. Because it is here that the consequences of whatever is agreed will most be felt. I recognise, too, that the majority of voters in Northern Ireland voted to remain. And that many will feel that once again decisions taken in Westminster are having a profound – and in many cases unwanted – impact in Northern Ireland and Ireland.So I am determined to work towards a solution that can command broader support from across the community in Northern Ireland.As we do so, there are a number of commitments that will underpin our approach and which must be part of any alternative arrangements that we seek to negotiate with the EU and pass through the UK Parliament. First, we stand by our commitment in the Joint Report that there will be no hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls.And this means people on either side of that border will be able to live their lives as they do now. I have spoken to people in places like Fermanagh who remember the customs border posts, approved roads and security installations of the not-so distant past. I have spoken to businesses who have supply chains that cross between Great Britain, Northern Ireland and Ireland. I understand how thousands of people move back and forth between Northern Ireland and Ireland every day – to go to work, to visit family, even to do their shopping. I understand what a hard border would mean – not just in terms of the disruption at the border itself, but in terms of trade for the whole island.The Belfast Agreement delivers “just and equal treatment for the identity, ethos and aspirations of both communities.” And for many a seamless border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is integral to delivering this.And I know this has been the cornerstone around which the community in Northern Ireland has come together to deliver peace and prosperity. And I will not do anything to put that at risk. So while I have said that technology could play a part, and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.Second, neither will I compromise on my promise to protect Northern Ireland’s integral place in the UK. When the European Commission proposed a version of the backstop which involved creating a customs border in the Irish Sea, I successfully resisted it. And I have ruled out anyto such a suggestion. This would not only damage the integrity of the UK’s internal market which is so vital to businesses across the UK – and not least here in Northern Ireland.It would also ignore the very real concerns of many people about being cut off from the rest of the UK. Furthermore, we will also ensure there will be no new regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK without Northern Ireland’s institutions having their say.Third, there will be full protection for all existing cross-border co-operation. Many areas of cooperation have been identied – both those formally set out by the North South Ministerial Council such as cooperation on health and transport, or keeping the island of Ireland disease-free for animals and plants……and informal areas of co-operation such as a single integrated electricity market that supplies power to everyone.Every area of existing cross-border co-operation must be respected. If these are ever to change in the future, it will be a matter for Belfast and Dublin in accordance with the three-stranded approach, not as a consequence of our EU exit.Fourth, we will uphold the rights enshrined in the Belfast Agreement for all the people of Northern Ireland, right across the whole community. This includes upholding commitments around mutual respect, religious liberties, equality of opportunity, tolerance and rights.I know that there are some in the nationalist community in particular who worry that some of their existing rights could be eroded when the UK leaves the EU.So we have already enshrined in the Withdrawal Agreement a legal guarantee of no diminution of equality and rights.There have also been serious concerns raised about how UK immigration rules treat citizens here exercising their rights under the Agreement to be Irish.The birth right to identy and be accepted as British, Irish or both, and to hold both British and Irish citizenship is absolutely central to the Agreement.But I know that in some cases recently, people have encountered dficulties in securing their rights as Irish citizens to bring in family members. I understand the serious concerns that have been raised.So I have asked the Home Secretary, working closely with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to review these issues urgently to deliver a long term solution consistent with the letter and spirit of the Belfast Agreement. Without a devolved Government - and with only unionists represented in the House of Commons - it is more important than ever that we uphold our duty to ensure all voices in Northern Ireland are heard. I take that very seriously indeed and the UK Government will always work in the interests of the whole community.So tomorrow I will be sitting down with the political parties to discuss the way forward and ensure that we can deliver for all the people of Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland does not have to rely on the Irish Government or the European Union to prevent ato borders of the past. The UK government will not let that happen. I will not let that happen. At the same time, we must continue to support all efforts that can lead towards the restoration of Northern Ireland’s political institutions. And the UK Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that when an Executive is restored it will have real influence to speak for all the people of Northern Ireland as we shape the UK’s future relationship with the European Union. As we work to address the unique challenges that Brexit poses to Northern Ireland, so I also want to ensure that we continue to maintain – and indeed enhance – the strongest possible bilateral partnership between the UK and Ireland.I have said many times that I want to see a new, deep and special partnership between the UK and the  Member States of the European Union. But our relationship with Ireland is deeper than our relationship with any of the other . It is uniquely rooted in ties of family, history and geography. The recent past has been a moment of reflection in the UK and Ireland as we have commemorated the centenary of a series of key events in our shared history. Ireland remembered the centenary of the Easter Rising in an inclusive manner which promoted a greater understanding of our often troubled history.While our two countries remembered together the shared sacrice of so many who fought side by side in the First World War. The ceremony at Messines in , attended by HRH the Duke of Cambridge and former Taoiseach Enda Kenny was particularly poignant, as it remembered the soldiers of the th Irish and th Ulster Division who both played a key role in the Allied victory in that battle.Today those ties of family and friendship between our countries are more important than they have ever been. And I believe there is a yearning in the hearts of all the peoples of these islands for a close and trusting relationship between all of us, and an absolute horror that we should take even a single step backwards in the progress we have collectively achieved.So I want to work closely with the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Irish Government, as so many of our predecessors have before, to strengthen the bilateral relationship we have built. And this can and should take many forms.We already have the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, and regular Summits between UK and Irish politicians. But as we leave the European Union, we will need to establish new ways of coming together to develop further our unique relationship.For example, the Irish Government has suggested annual meetings where the Prime Minister and Taoiseach, together with senior Ministerial colleagues, come together to discuss the big issues of the day.We will also want to strengthen our economic relationship and have already together identied areas like construction and smart cities as ripe for enhanced collaboration.And both the UK and the Irish Governments have already made clear that we would support the tantalising possibility of a joint UK and Ireland World Cup Bid for , should our respective football associations choose to pursue this.We also want to find creative ways of enhancing the links between all our peoples – and in particular, to build the links between our young people. I know there is a sense that many British people do not know enough, or understand enough, about the complexity of the long relationship between the UK and Ireland. And a sense that some Irish people are less familiar with the forces and motivations that help to shape views in the UK. So as part of these new ways of coming together, I would like to us to look in particular at opportunities for our young people to discuss these issues and others in a structured way and to reflect on their vision for our future relationship.I know this is a concerning time for many people here in Northern Ireland. But we will find a way to deliver Brexit that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland……that commands broad support across the communities in Northern Ireland… …and that secures a majority in the Westminster Parliament, which is the best way to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland.As we do so, I hope we can also take steps to move towards the restoration of devolution – so that politicians in Northern Ireland can get back to work on the issues that matter to the people they represent. For ultimately, the measure of this moment in Northern Ireland’s history must be more than whether we avoid ato the challenges of the past. It must be how, together, we move forwards to shape the opportunities of the future. As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, it is a profound honour and duty to play my part in shaping that future… …and to do my utmost to support the peace, prosperity and progress that can give the people of Northern Ireland, the brightest future for generations.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

I will not let that happen.”Prime Minister Theresa May speaks with business representatives at Allstate in Belfast on her Brexit plans on Tuesday February , . Photo: Liam McBurney PA WireBut asked how she could convince the people of Northern Ireland to accept a Brexit deal which was stripped of the backstop, Mrs May said: “I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesn’t contain that insurance policy for the future.“What Parliament has said is that they believe there should be changes made to the backstop.”It was in that light that she was working with MPs, the Irish government and the EU to find a way to meet the commitment to take Britain out of the EU on March  with a deal which avoided a hard border, she said.Mrs May is due to travel to Brussels on Thursday for her first face-to-face talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker since the Withdrawal Agreement they reached last November was rejected by the House of Commons.She will seek to secure changes which can persuade MPs to support her deal in a series of votes expected on February .• In full: Theresa May’s speech in BelfastMPs voted last week for an amendment tabled by Conservative grandee Sir Graham Brady and backed by the Prime Minister which “requires the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”.There was immediate concern from Conservative Brexiteers over Mrs May’s apparent indication that she was instead seeking “changes” to the backstop arrangement, intended to keep the border openno broader trade deal is reached after Brexit.A source from the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs told the Press Association: “Evenshe doesn’t mean what she said, we still do.”Challenged over whether she had made a U-turn, Mrs May said: “There is no suggestion that we are not going to ensure that in the future there is provision for this - it’s been called an insurance policy, the backstop - that ensures thatthe future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, there will be arrangements in place to ensure that we deliver no hard border.”In her speech to an audience of Northern Irish business leaders, Mrs May said she wanted to “affirm my commitment to delivering a Brexit that ensures noto a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, which is unshakeable”.IN FULL: Theresa May’s speech in Belfast Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The Prime Minister acknowledged the importance of a seamless border and how the current arrangements had helped “deliver peace and prosperity”.She said: “While I have said that technology could play a part and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.”Mrs May added: “Northern Ireland does not have to rely on the Irish government or the European Union to prevent ato borders of the past.“The UK Government will not let that happen. I will not let that happen.”She announced a review by Home Secretary Sajid Javid of issues surrounding dficulties faced by residents of Irish nationality in bringing family members into Northern Ireland.And she pledged to work with Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to “continue to maintain - and indeed enhance - the strongest possible bilateral partnership between the UK and Ireland” after Brexit.• In full: Theresa May’s speech in BelfastJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8790363.1548852258!/image/image.jpg","title":"transport","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Transport   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Transport Politics Crime Farming Education Business Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat s News News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Transport      Driving tests cancelled at some NI centres - amid ongoing weather warningsDriving tests have been cancelled today in some areas due to the adverse weather conditions.

One of his historical advisors, Lord Bew, a very respected figure in the House of Lords, he said one of the most remarkable things was the British government had not challenged this Irish narrative on the Belfast Good Friday Agreement in recent years and I’m wondering what you think about that.“He is concerned, like Lord Trimble, that Britain would be signing away the right, the possibility of there one day there being regulatory and customs ergence on the island of Ireland.Are you going to keep open that possibility for Britain ” Mrs May replied: “What I’ve made clear and you’ve heard me repeat in my speech, is the commitment that we made in the December joint report, December  joint report, to ensure Ireland’s place in the — the integral place that NI has within the internal market of the United Kingdom. We have already set forth, set out within Westminster, ways in which we believe as a UK government we would deliver on that.“I recognise the concerns that have been expressed about regulatory dferences but as I say, we were absolutely clear in that December joint report, and we retain our absolute commitment to that, to ensure Northern Ireland’s integral place in the UK’s internal market.”Ken Reid of UTV asked:“Fty six per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain, it has wide support in the business community here as well. How are you going to persuade particularly nationalist politicians, the nationalist parties, to accept a deal that doesn’t contain a backstop ”Mrs May replied: “Well I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesn’t contain that insurance policy for the future. What Parliament has said is that they believe there should be changes made to the backstop.”Prime minister tells Belfast event she is seeking change to backstop, rather than its removalParties will face down Sinn Fein on city hall statue provision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I will not let that happen.The Prime Minister is expected to meet the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein among others on Wednesday during Stormont talks .But asked how she could convince the people of Northern Ireland to accept a Brexit deal which was stripped of the backstop, Mrs May said:ldquoIrsquom not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesnrsquot contain that insurance policy for the future.ldquoWhat Parliament has said is that they believe there should be changes made to the backstop.It was in that light that she was working with MPs, the Irish government and the EU to find a way to meet the commitment to take Britain out of the EU on March  with a deal which avoided a hard Irish border, she said.The Irish Government accused the Prime Minister of harbouring unrealistic expectations over the backstop.The mechanism has polarised nationalists and unionists.Many unionists believe the ldquoinsurance policy to preserve a frictionless frontier on the island of Ireland could threaten the integrity of the UKNorthern Irelandrsquos customs regulations ied from Great Britain after Brexit.Nationalists and many business leaders fear major disruption to trade and a hard border threatening peace process gainsno deal is struck and the backstop is not triggered.Meanwhile, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will travel to Brussels for meetings with European Council president Donald Tusk and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.Mrs May is due to visit the Belgian capital on Thursday, where she will hold a series of talks with key figures including Mr Tusk, Mr Juncker, European Parliament president Antonio Tajani and the European Parliamentrsquos chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt.It will be the Prime Ministerrsquos first chance to hold first face-to-face talks in Brussels since the Withdrawal Agreement reached last November was rejected by the House of Commons.And it comes a week after MPs voted for an amendment tabled by Conservative grandee Sir Graham Brady and backed by the Prime Minister which ldquorequires the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border.Mrs May will seek to secure changes which can persuade MPs to support her deal in a series of votes expected on February .In Westminster, the working group bringing together senior Eurosceptic and former Remain-supporting Tories will continue efforts to agree alternatives to the backstop along the lines of the Malthouse Compromise.Talks involving Conservatives including Brexiteers Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers, Steve Baker and Owen Paterson along with former Remainers Nicky Morgan and Damian Green will continue in Whitehall, chaired by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay.The first meeting on Monday was described as ldquodetailed and constructive by the Brexit department..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: PM to meet main NI parties as she engages on backstop article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
