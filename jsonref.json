We wanted to be able to unpack, not have to re-pack and move.\u0027It wasn\u0027t the best start to the holiday.\u0027The couple refused to step foot in the buffet restaurant but gave a couple of other hotel restaurants a chance during the second week - but claim they were served under-cooked chicken.Mr Whatley said: \u0027There were two other restaurants on site that we went to during the second week as we were starting to get a bit low on funds, but we could only use them once per stay.\u0027All that food was cooked basically in front of you - you could see the chefs - but even then the chicken Hannah had on a skewer wasn\u0027t cooked properly.\u0027We inspected our food meticulously while eating there, I couldn\u0027t just relax and eat it normally.\u0027Hannah cut into the chicken and said she didn\u0027t think it was cooked very well and only had a couple of bites.\u0027She complained about having a bad belly the following day.\u0027The day before the couple left to go home they were so low on funds they couldn\u0027t afford a meal out.Resigned, the couple returned to the buffet restaurant one last time.Mr Whatley said: \u0027We had about 20 lev left, about £10, which wouldn\u0027t have been enough to go and eat out for us both to have a meal.\u0027We decided at lunchtime to go to the restaurant where the buffet food is.         Despite paying for an all-inclusive stay, the repulsed pair couldn\u0027t bear the thought of eating another morsel there and claim to have instead forked out £700 on food during their two-week stay         Mr Whatley said: \u0027I\u0027ve never booked with TUI before and definitely won\u0027t book with them again\u0027\u0027Hannah brought over a plate of chicken that had red sauce on it with rice, while I had beef.\u0027She cut into it said it looked red. I tipped water over it and you could see blood inside, which I thought was weird for chicken.\u0027She\u0027d eaten two pieces before that and only thought to look at it because it felt funny in her mouth - she said the texture was not right and it was \u0027squishy\u0027.\u0027When we saw the inside of it Hannah was disgusted and near enough cried when she looked at it.\u0027I was so fuming, after everything, I wrapped the chicken up in a serviette and took it to the TUI rep.\u0027I slammed it on the table and said I\u0027ve had enough of this and showed it to her. She heaved in front of us.\u0027She apologised and registered it as a complaint and wrote that she\u0027d given us 70 lev (£32.17) as a gesture of goodwill for us to buy food.\u0027When the couple returned from holiday frustrated Mr Whatley lodged a complaint with TUI and 29 days later received a reply claiming that it was an \u0027isolated incident\u0027.The company also said that the couple had been compensated and accepted the 70 lev as a resolution to the problem.Mr Whatley said: \u0027I felt proper disheartened when I received that response from TUI, which is a massive company.\u0027From the balcony to the food - it ruined it. I wanted to come home by the fourth day but we stuck it out just because if we\u0027d come home we\u0027d only be sat at home in front of the telly doing nothing, at least there we were in the sun.\u0027I think it\u0027s awful the way TUI have handled it, I\u0027ve never dealt with a company like it.\u0027Their slogan says they \u0027cross the \u0027T\u0027s, dot the \u0027I\u0027s, and put \u0027U\u0027 in the middle\u0027. I felt like I was pushed to the side - not the middle.\u0027We were both more than ready to come home.\u0027I\u0027ve never booked with TUI before and definitely won\u0027t book with them again.\u0027A TUI UK spokesperson said: \u0027We are very sorry to hear of the Whatley party\u0027s experience in Bulgaria. When the customers raised their concerns in resort our rep worked hard to resolve their issue, however we understand this was still a disappointing experience.\u0027We will be in touch with the customer to apologise and offer them a gesture of goodwill. We\u0027d like to reassure customers that we carry out regular health and safety audits, including hygiene, at all of the hotels we feature.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Japans prime minister Shinzo Abe loses ground wins countrys election","story":"Share this article \u0027Instead, by leading the ruling coalition to another national election victory - his sixth in his nearly seven years as LDP (Liberal Democratic Party) leader - Abe has cemented his status atop Japan\u0027s political system,\u0027 Harris added.Abe\u0027s LDP and its coalition partner Komeito took 71 of the 124 seats up for grabs in Sunday\u0027s vote, accounting for about half of the upper chamber.The two parties already control 70 seats in the other half of the 245-seat chamber that was not being contested.Analysts said Abe\u0027s coalition has benefitted from a weak opposition, and voter turnout underscored apathy in the electorate, falling below 50 percent for the first time since a 1995 upper house election.          Abe fell short of achieving a super-majority in the upper chamber which would have paved the way for him to amend the country\u0027s pacifist constitutionAbe\u0027s ruling bloc has a super-majority of two-thirds of the seats in the lower chamber, but Sunday\u0027s results mean he has a slimmer chance of achieving his long-cherished goal of reforming Japan\u0027s postwar pacifist constitution before his term ends in 2021.Nonetheless, Abe welcomed the results, saying winning the majority means the public\u0027s mandate for his government.\u0027I believe the people chose political stability, urging us to pursue our policies and carry out diplomacy to protect Japan\u0027s national interests,\u0027 Abe told NHK.He was at his party\u0027s election headquarters where he monitored results, placing red ribbons on winners\u0027 names written on a panel.Up for grabs were 124 seats in the less powerful of Japan\u0027s two parliamentary chambers.

He talks about their enlightened depictions of black people – and reveals who was the Renaissance TupacThere’s something of the Renaissance man about Fred Braithwaite, AKA Fab 5 Freddy. A graffiti artist turned film-maker, producer and curator, Braithwaite spent much of the 80s speeding from downtown to uptown New York, connecting the punk scene with hip-hop DJs and graffiti crews like his Fabulous Five. He worked with everyone from Jean-Michel Basquiat to Nas, Blondie and the Clash. With his signature Kangol hat and oval shades, he became a torchbearer for hip-hop in the late 80s and early 90s, fronting MTV’s flagship rap show and conducting formative interviews with a fresh-faced Tupac and a typically spaced-out Tribe Called Quest.Upgrading the Kangol for a fedora and the shades for thick-rimmed reading glasses, Braithwaite now has the calmly authoritative air of an elder statesman. So much so that he has moved into Alan Yentob territory, making a film for the BBC about the hidden representations of black figures in Italian Renaissance art, under the painfully alliterative title A Fresh Guide to Florence with Fab 5 Freddy. He even opens the show on horseback, trotting outside the Uffizi like a feudal lord. Where other hip-hop luminaries like Wu Tang Clan have their obsessions with shaolin kung fu, OutKast with aliens and MF Doom with comic-book villains, it seems Braithwaite’s cultural touchstones are rather more academic.While his show is serious, Braithwaite is on terrific form when he turns his hip-hop-referencing gaze on to art history. Machiavelli is “Tupac’s guy”, Michelangelo is “the Michael Jackson of the Renaissance”, as well as being a “street artist” for his wall drawings in the Medici tombs. And he revels in the controversy of Titian’s Venus of Urbino, which almost saw the artist excommunicated for its eroticised nudity.The roots of his fascination run deep. “When I was a kid,” he says, “I would cut school to travel around Manhattan museums.” The politan was his favourite because of its lax entry policy. “I would show up and toss a nickel in the admissions box then spend a day in fantasy land, going from English armour to Renaissance paintings, pop art to expressionism.” It was an unusual interest, not one he could share with “the kids on the corner from the hood”. But it sparked his own artistic career as a subway graffiti artist and led to a lasting bond with Basquiat, who he met as a teenager. “He would spend a lot of his childhood at the Brooklyn Museum just as I did at the Met,” he says. “Finally, there was someone I could talk to about Caravaggio and Rothko. We were both so impressed with the radical nature of modernist manifestos like futurism. They gave us – two young, black kids – the capacity to articulate what we wanted to say.”He thought a lot about Basquiat while making this film. “I don’t know if he ever went to Florence but he would have absolutely loved it. The fact that the works are shown where they’re intended to be, in their basilicas, would have been very important to him. He cared a lot about how his work was shown.”This need to control the narrative around creativity was a result of the racial restraints of the 80s, which also affected Braithwaite. “Gallery people would be shocked that I knew who people like Ad Reinhardt were,” he says, laughing. “They wouldn’t expect a black kid from Brooklyn to be into these things. Nobody was writing or saying anything positive about the graffiti we were doing. They just thought we were grimy criminal kids. So that’s why I made Wild Style.” This was his 1982 film about a fictional graffiti artist from the Bronx called Zoro. “We had to take control and show graffiti to the world. We made it street art and we’ve given you Banksy now.”The message took time to spread, though. It wasn’t until the early 90s and the arrival of NWA, Tupac and the Notorious BIG that hip-hop went global. “Again, it’s race that held us back,” Braithwaite says. “There was a movement of radical creatives in New York and they were all outsiders. But we were so outside we were almost locked out.”In his new film, Braithwaite looks back to the Italian Renaissance of the 15th and 16th centuries when, he believes, racial stereotypes were not as prevalent. He references such works as Carpaccio’s Miracle of the Relic of the True Cross on the Rialto Bridge, with its realist depiction of an elegantly dressed black gondolier in the foreground, citing it as an example of Italian metropolitan multiculturalism. “What was interesting was that before the African slave trade began, the concept of race didn’t really exist,” he says. “The depictions of African people weren’t stereotyped. They were presented faithfully and they were just seen as part of life. Then you skip to the 1980s, when you think we would have come much further, and you have critics and gallerists calling Jean-Michel’s work ‘tribal’. I remember thinking, ‘You’re an ignorant racist if you think he’s some wild man that they pulled off the streets and locked up in the basement and gave some paints to.’”Braithwaite sees the mid-17th century tomb of Doge Giovanni Pesaro – a gargantuan marble monument held up by sculpted depictions of four grimacing slaves – as a turning point. “That made me sick to my stomach,” he says. “It was visceral to see how these black figures were carved and then to know that this is how black people would continue to be represented after the African slave trade started. Before it began, slavery wasn’t as brutal – it would be conquered people following their conqueror’s religion and language. It was a milder form of slavery, not the barbaric, for-profit trade that then developed.”The tomb is certainly an arresting sight, but anyone who regards all slavery as exploitative and subjugating may take issue with Braithwaite’s comments. Academics have also documented how multiculturalism contributed to racial stereotypes. Racism and the concept of race, it seems, stretch much further back than the Renaissance.Braithwaite fares better when he examines how art represented marginalised figures, calling this “giving the pioneers their dues”. His film analyses overlooked early Renaissance depictions of Africans, such as Mantegna’s Scenes from the Life of Christ, where an African king is depicted among the wise men coming to worship the birth of Christ, and Giotto’s Trial by Fire, which shows St Francis walking through flames to convince the surrounding African nobility of Christianity.In Braithwaite’s view, there is no caricature of Africans here, just humanistic depictions, albeit in the background. “Unfortunately, black people are still misrepresented in the media and art world,” he says. “There need to be more people of colour in positions of responsibility, otherwise black people will remain invisible in plain sight as they are in these paintings. Everyone needs to be represented equally.”One hip-hop pioneer Braithwaite references is 70s DJ Grandmaster Flowers. A staple at the New York parties Braithwaite would attend as a young man, Flowers fell into obscurity and crack addiction. In the 90s, Braithwaite spotted him one day, homeless and begging, outside a record store where he was filming for MTV. “They say the first through the door gets all the bullets,” he says. “I just managed to dodge some. So it’s my role to talk about these people like Flowers, who left without a trace.”Braithwaite has certainly managed to leave a trace. Recently donating his hip-hop archive to the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, he is no longer a radical outsider. “Being honoured after your death is the struggle that revolutionary art movements have,” he says. “You’ll always run up against ignorant people and you have to tear through those boundaries, whether you like it or not. That’s why I was so taken by the technical innovations of Renaissance art and even by what the punks were doing in the 80s because they were all challenging people. I’m lucky I’m still here and I’ll keep on pushing those boundaries. There’s still so much to discover.”• A Fresh Guide to Florence with Fab 5 Freddy is on BBC2 on Saturday 27 July at 9pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b18848a570aa501b9657f05e07ffc699fae4974d/0_0_4724_3149/master/4724.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e2ad6780d9f11233b86452dcaa7797c6 960w","title":"the english job understanding iran why it distrusts britain by jack straw review","story":"The former foreign secretary examines why Iran, for all its domestic flaws, has just cause to fear foreign influenceAlmost four years ago, the former foreign secretary Jack Straw went on holiday with his wife and a couple of friends to Iran, where he experienced what he calls a “forced conscription into a thriller”. Visiting the cypress of Abarkuh, a tree estimated to be up to 5,000 years old, the foursome were confronted by a group of men dressed in religiously observant black. They were members of the Basij, the thuggish volunteer offshoot of the Revolutionary Guards, and they handed Straw a leaflet explaining why he was unwelcome in their country.The document detailed Britain’s perfidious 19th- and 20th-century track record in Iran and claimed that the recently retired Straw was a subversive agent of the British state, using his visit to sow discord. Thereafter the Basij followed the party everywhere until the Iranian police intervened. Armed and undercover, they bundled Straw and his friends into a car, as if they were being kidnapped, and whisked them away into hiding.As Straw drily notes, to be given police protection from criminals and terrorists is one thing, but to be given police protection against other parts of the state is quite another. “I can think of no other country in the world where that occurs,” he writes.The English Job: Understanding Iran and Why It Distrusts Britain is a response to that strange experience and the accusations made in the Basij leaflet. The book is highly readable, full of vivid history, diplomatic anecdotes and personal observation. It explains the peculiar circumstances of a country finely balanced between becoming a nuclear power and risking international isolation. It’s written in a manner that is balanced, dispassionate and yet sympathetic to the Iranian people.As Straw shows, Iran is a nation that remains anachronistically fixated on the UK, as if it were a superpower capable of extraordinary influence far beyond its shores. There is a reason for this. Britain did once fit that description, and there were few countries in which its long and clandestine reach was felt with more resentment than in Iran.In the 19th century, the Iranian shah Naser al-Din granted Britain what Straw calls “the most extraordinary and rapacious business concessions”. He did this partly to recruit the British empire as a buffer against Russian encroachment, and partly for personal gain, but its effect was to establish the suspicion that the British had “only malign intentions” for Iran. That suspicion grew steadily and was confirmed in 1953 with Britain’s grubby role, along with the US, in unseating the democratically elected Iranian prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in an orchestrated coup. Power then swung to the shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who became increasingly autocratic. Hated by many of his people, he was eventually forced to flee in the 1979 revolution.Straw, who in 2001 became the first senior British minister to visit Iran since the 1979 revolution, is clear-eyed about, and damning of, Britain’s part in empowering the shah. But he’s not about to fall for the flagrant historical revisionism practised by the religious authorities who have held control since Ayatollah Khomeini hijacked the revolution.“The myth in the Islamic republic today,” writes Straw, “is that the clerics stood foursquare with Mosaddegh. They did the opposite. Their overriding concern, then as now, was to preserve their power and influence within Iran.”That determination has led to a modern nation with enormous potential being strangled by a shadow clerical state that thwarts all attempts at political modernisation. There is, in effect, a two-state system. One is the elected politicians with their ministries and the appearance of a functioning democracy. The other, more powerful, is run by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and ensures democracy is largely cosmetic.There have been several reform-minded presidents who have sought to create a more representative politics at home and a less aggressive image abroad. They have all had to work under the watchful eye of Khamenei, and it has seldom gone well for them. And, should popular resistance grow, Khamenei is not afraid to fix elections, as he almost certainly did in 2009, triggering the Green movement protests.Straw makes the case that Mohammad Khatami, Iran’s president when Straw became foreign minister in 2001, was someone the west could have done business with. He was beginning to push through reforms and, post-911, there were signs of international collaboration with the US. But that opportunity was destroyed by the inclusion of Iran in President George W Bush’s infamous axis of evil list. No one, it seems, is sure how the phrase “axis of evil” made it into the final speech. Its original author put it in with the expectation it would be taken out.Similarly, Straw thinks Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) nuclear deal with Iran is another, though more wilful, mistake. Yet it has to be said that the Iranian leadership, under Khamenei, do little to encourage confidence in their actions. They have been playing a game of brinkmanship for many decades that stems in part from fear of foreign meddling but also anxiety about domestic change.It is this tension that goes to the heart of a nation ided between public pretence and private interests. In 2011, members of the Basij – the group who tried to intimidate Straw on his Iran trip – ransacked compounds belonging to the British embassy. They smashed almost everything they could, except for one thing: bottles of alcohol, which they stole.Like the nuclear material that Iran is currently processing, that kind of hypocrisy has a dangerous half-life. Perhaps all that’s preventing a popular uprising is the nationalism fuelled by American hostility.This review is from the Observer• The English Job: Understanding Iran and Why It Distrusts Britain by Jack Straw is published by Biteback (£20).

You take your problems to the zaniest, maddest reaches of cyberspace – where wellness blogs with stock images of peonies and people with “daily practices” reside – and you grab at what you can find.This is the situation I found myself in two months ago when a range of factors united spectacularly to turn me – a high-functioning adult with a pilates studio membership and a solid credit rating – into an overworked perfectionist on the fast-track to burnout.I was booking ridiculous amounts of freelance work, which was great, but also definitely not great because there were few jobs I would ever say no to, and the joy of another record-breaking month would quickly give way to horror at how exactly I was going to fit it all in.At the same time, I was often on the road for travel stories, transiting in foreign cities, eating cold eggs in airport lounges, and my health began to suffer. My body was exhibiting strange symptoms in the form of heart palpitations and unexplained pains. Furthermore, I found it impossible to relax. My mind was snagged on the same punishing loop of work and deadlines and “what’s next? what’s next?” and I had forgotten how to just be.My GP insisted it was stress, but I was so arrogantly sure of my preternatural ability to push through, to get stuff done, that it took a lot of negative test results to concede my workaholism was making me ill. I would need to change and become one of those obnoxious people who can afford to have a lifestyle epiphany. I would de-stress. Find balance. Smell the roses, and then write about it.And so my twice-weekly yoga became daily exercises. I stopped drinking coffee after midday, if at all, and I cut back on red wine.I downloaded a meditation app that piped in the sounds I was aching most to hear: rain on a tin roof, raucous birdsong, the ocean surging.I focused on my breathing and I made sure I got enough sunlight. I ate wholefoods, for crying out loud, and I may have purchased green tea.And it wasn’t as if this stuff didn’t help, because in a way it did. It helped to sustain my freelance lifestyle and it kept me functioning. But functioning was my problem. I was functioning my arse off. I needed to function less.So when my partner came home one day and told me about a series of commissions he had secured up north, I suggested we jump in the car and just go there. As in right now. This afternoon. Let’s take the dog, I said, and we can both work remotely.And off we went, north through the hardscrabble farming country of Victoria’s interior to the vivid greenery of the superannuated southern highlands into the epicentre of anti-vaxxer counter-culture of northern NSW and, finally, on to a jerry-built, dog-friendly rental in the Sunshine Coast hinterland.Along the way, I ate terriblegreat roadside food and drank middling pinot noir with my lunch. I didn’t do any exercise other than walking in the local parks, and I stopped counting daily steps.Each day I woke to the sound of the sea, or the wind in the trees, or some other natural sound that I used to download on my smartphone.I listened to all the music and watched all the TV shows and read all the books that I had loved as a child and, gradually, I found my way back to myself. My heart rate slowed. The fog cleared.In a recent article on her sudden move to rural Greece, Brisbane writer Susan Johnson gorgeously refers to this shedding of skin as “slipping the net”. My road trip north was my version of that freedom, of going off-course so that I may eventually return to the busy thoroughfare of life, not a different person exactly, but not entirely the same either.I don’t doubt that daily yoga or meditation can be life-changing for many, but there is far from one prescribed path to transforming your life or looking after your wellbeing.We all want a life we don’t need regular health retreats and breaks from in order to withstand. And finding that life – and the unsteady, ungainly process of that task – looks different for everyone.What I discovered was that leaving my problems behind for a little while, indulging in empty pleasure and ignoring popular wellness advice was the salve my soul needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ba104a4454b9fdca29b3d472c0c3454941bf4f1/5_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75c837ea70f8bd3bc47e06e0cc1ae0cc","title":"eu negotiating table influence britain uk brussels","story":"The Conservative party’s choice of a new leader will also impact on Britain’s influence in the world. Friendship, not showmanship, is valued by foreign governments. Bluster at home diminishes lustre abroad.Over many years, Brexiters constructed a fable that presents the UK as the helpless victim of an unaccountable bureaucracy in Brussels. Their version of history has become ever more at odds with reality. Brave Britannia is increasingly portrayed as a heroic underdog determined to fight for its independence from Europe. It matters not a jot that the organisation from which the UK is purportedly seeking to escape is a decent grouping of democratic nations that the UK willingly joined, which it helped significantly to shape and of which at least half the British people now very much wish their country to remain a member.It is probably impossible to break the link between the fantastical tale and its fanatical followers. However, in the hope that rational argument still has some role to play in British public debate, the record should be set straight regarding the reality of the influence that Britain has brought to bear in shaping EU decisions and indeed the European project as a whole.I was in a social setting recently with a group of British people with differing views on Brexit. The issue was simmering below the surface when one of them proclaimed that the UK was leaving the EU because “we don’t like France telling us what to do”. This nonsensical, but not untypical, interpretation of relative French and British influence in Europe will come as a surprise to many not least to generations of French negotiators for whom frustration with the impact of “perfidious Albion” was a familiar EU experience. There is, of course, a fundamental contradiction between asserting that the EU is run by bureaucrats and that it is subject to excessive influence by other governments.For three decades I sat around the European negotiating table, worked the Brussels corridors and networked in EU capitals. The truth is that, throughout the years of its membership, the UK has been particularly effective in the pursuit of its interests.Like other member states, the UK has been represented around every EU negotiating table at every level as the decisions have been thrashed out. Sadly, many British people are not even aware that there were such tables to sit around. The UK also elected its members to the European parliament. Its EU commissioners helped to shape EU legislation. British nationals have held key positions in all the EU institutions.But British influence in the EU went well beyond that available to most member states. The UK’s impact was exceptional due to several factors. The quality of its civil servants. The effectiveness of its coordination mechanisms. The reach of its diplomacy. The potency of its networking. The admiration for its pragmatism. The predominance of the English language.British influence in Europe, it is true, was hamstrung in self-inflicted ways. The UK’s decision to opt out of some key policy areas diminished British influence in other areas. London governments, partly driven by a jingoistic media, often favoured short-term tactics over long-term strategy. If the UK had put as much heart as it did head into its European policy, its influence would have been much greater. David Cameron’s decision to pull the Conservatives out of the EPP Group in the European parliament diminished British influence there a development compounded by extreme British Eurosceptic MEPs more interested in throwing shapes rather than in shaping policy.Every member state has its strengths and weaknesses. But there is a wide measure of consensus across Europe that British influence on the EU has been exceptional and immense. The EU today looks more like the one the UK wanted a quarter of a century ago than the one France had in mind.Brexit will change all that. Europe will be the poorer for the loss of British influence. But Britain itself will be diminished even more. It is important that our British friends understand the influence they once had in Europe so that they also know what they are giving up. As an EU, without the UK, continues to shape the legislation and regulatory standards that will affect British business, France will be delighted to find that it has more scope to “tell the UK what to do” than was ever possible when the UK significantly influenced every decision.• Bobby McDonagh was Ireland’s ambassador to the UK from 2009-2013"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab09daea537fcb7aa8dcaddb57bcfa7871d6cff3/0_65_4601_2760/master/4601.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e358436d5b1b0e7af08fe7c93f280949","title":"summer job wet wales ice cream parlour childhood","story":"In the first of a series, our writers reflect on the lessons they learned from a summer encounter with workIt was the summer after my first year of university, and I was back in uniform for the first time since school. The blue baseball cap and polo shirt combination was not glamorous, and I hated wearing my hair up, but the ice-cream parlour in the Snowdonian village of my childhood was hiring, and I needed the work.These sorts of summer jobs are on the decline among young people with technology at their disposal, but I didn’t have the option to become an influencer or an internet millionaire. Back home, everyone I knew worked a summer job, but my distinctly posher university friends were off on adventures: backpacking around South America, repairing to their families’ houses in the south of France, Interrailing. I had already wasted a substantial wodge of cash on a quixotic attempt at a law degree that had me begging fervently to transfer courses before the tedium of property law actually killed me. Back in the village I had worked so hard to leave, I was doubting whether I could afford university at all.The ice-cream parlour was a fairly new addition to the high street, but in a village with a thriving summer tourist economy it seemed like a good bet. Other friends were stacking shelves at Tesco or doing gruelling kitchen shifts, while the parlour was a friendly family business adored by my ice-cream-loving autistic brother, who would pop in with my mum before his walk around the lake. They treated their staff with kindness and we responded with enthusiasm and respect. Furthermore, they were happy for us to try out the ice-cream, which was homemade. I can still recall the creamy mascarpone-infused strawberry cheesecake the richness of the dark, milkless chocolate. Access to the counter’s rainbow array of flavours would have been the fulfilment of any child’s dream.What the family hadn’t banked on was the summer being one of the wettest any of us could remember. Sheets of torrential rain swept the high street, and even the most foolhardy of amateur climbers took one look at Snowdon and packed off home. (We have a local saying along the lines of: if you can’t see Snowdon, it’s raining. If you can, it’s still raining.) Occasionally a family of tourists in kagoules would drift in reeling from the deluge, but for long periods of time the shop was empty. This must have been extremely worrying for the owners, whose business was fairly new, but what it meant for me was silence and solitude. Hours of it, sometimes.In hindsight, I was depressed. Not because of the job, which gave me some structure and routine (in between shifts, I mostly lay on the sofa), but because of life events. I had dropped out of my course, had no money, and had had a bad breakup. London felt lonely and expensive, infested by privilege. Despite being in a sort of despairing fugue state, I spent my days serving up, with a smile, marshmallow pink ice-cream to children.“I don’t know why you’d want to live in London,” my boss said, after which I merely glanced pointedly to the biblical gale twisting its way down the high street. A boy I had known since primary school slouched past and we shared a fag on the pavement outside. “I have to get out of here before I become someone’s dad,” he told me, taking rapid puffs. I knew what he meant: Kirsty MacColl’s twist on the Billy Bragg line “All the girls I knew at school were already pushing prams” came to mind. The fissure between those who leave and those who stay had already opened, and I had not yet picked a side. I had entered the adult world without a backwards glance but here I was again, immersed in childhood.What did I learn? That a boss who allows you to read in the quiet moments is invaluable. I made my way through my new course list: Calvino, Elsa Morante, Levi, Pirandello, John Berger’s Ways of Seeing. I read the classics my mother had left in my room two years before as a gentle nudge that law might not have been the right choice: Tess of the D’Urbervilles (things could be worse), Mansfield Park, little taster scoops of Ulysses. But before too long I had jettisoned them all for children’s literature: The Georgia Nicholson books by Louise Rennison, Just William, all the Harry Potter books.A part-time or summer job is a crucial stepping stone to adulthood, but what I hadn’t realised at the time was how it helped me accept my childhood. The children of the ice-cream parlour’s owners, and those who came into the shop, were in heaven. The Welsh mountains provided them with the freedom and adventure that I had come to take for granted.It would be the last summer I went home for the vacation. Not long afterwards, one of the kindly owners died, leaving behind a young family and a business that is thankfully thriving to this day. London was not to his taste, but it was to mine, and I came to make a success of it. But I owe my job at the ice-cream parlour for helping me get there, and for teaching me that becoming an adult doesn’t mean leaving the whole of your childhood behind.I dropped in there not long ago, with an old friend who has been very ill. There was some other teenager behind the counter. I asked for dark chocolate, and my friend chose bubblegum, and I teased her for choosing like a kid would. We walked around the rim of the lake and talked about who was dead and who was in prison and who had had another baby, as we always do. I wanted to tell her that I regretted leaving so abruptly, that she would always be like family to me. But it felt mawkish, so I made another joke about her cone. She stuck her tongue out at me in response. It was bright blue.• Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a  columnist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b983e3b8becc7992baaf1e01d56df66e8301c6bc/0_80_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=574e7e6a56ecd4bab3495ea3a6e2262f","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of climb","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘climb’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘climb’.Share your photos of what climb means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 24 July at 10am.

He’s exactly the sort of well-spoken, charming, scrubbed-up home counties boy you’d expect to find at Latitude festival, although he’s brought chirpy chart smashes with his tent. With its highfalutin foods, “enchanted garden” and luxury camping with “pamper parlour”, it’s the most middle-class (and, shh, loveliest) festival, but it isn’t without edge.Louisa Roach of Liverpudlian psych-popsters She Drew the Gun raps about food banks, and Primal Scream’s set is packed with hits, politics and Glaswegian sarcasm. Giant Trump images give Swastika Eyes a powerful new relevance before Bobby Gillespie comically urges the cheering audience to “Get your rocks off, country bumpkins!” There’s drama, too. Sunderland spiky guitar types the Futureheads’ return to the circuit after seven years is cut short after three songs by an electrical storm the festival’s cutesy pink dip-dyed sheep prompt a Peta protest and social media outrage.After Snow Patrol’s withdrawal in the wake of medical issues, late replacements Stereophonics surprisingly pull the weekend’s biggest crowd as their unfashionable but catchy post-Britpop anthems unite the Latitude demographic: parents and their teens. Most remain in place for electronic dance giants Underworld, whose blistering, career-ning set is perfectly timed as the crowd’s mood shifts from singalong to party.Elsewhere, you can stumble across Simon Armitage reading poetry, Frank Skinner or Michelle Wolf doing standup, or dream away to Sigrid or Aurora’s mellifluous Scandi-pop. And indeed, women dominate Sunday’s main stage. Pale Waves, Cat Power and the joyously exuberant Chvrches steadily up the ante before Lana Del Rey brings her classic, fatalistic take on Americana to a moonlit Suffolk field.Eschewing her studio ennui, she sings Pretty When You Cry writhing on the floor, Video Games from a trapeze and poses with front-row fans for selfies.

What I found was a completely charming province, and one that’s very erse, too, with so many different experiences you can have. You’ve got city life in Halifax, then sprawling national parks, and so much of life here is led on or by the water. I came here with the challenge of creating a mural on a building in Halifax, and I found so much inspiration along the way. The result was amazing – I left a little piece of myself on the harbour front.As there are year-round direct flights from London to Halifax and they only take six hours, you can get right into the Halifax swing of things without long transfers or bad jet lag. Spend your first morning walking along its historic harbour front to get a feel for the city. It has great cultural experiences where you can learn more about the region’s past, like the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, and the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic. The Titanic exhibit at the Maritime Museum is particularly moving – while ship’s survivors went to New York, all who perished came to Halifax, and you can learn about their poignant personal stories here.One of the absolute gems of this region is the quaint, colourful village of Lunenburg, a Unesco world heritage site. Established in 1753 by the Brits, it’s just an hour’s drive from Halifax, and is best known for its beautiful, multicoloured 18th- and 19th-century buildings. There are so many shades, from tomato red, to deep purple and peppermint green ... strolling around and taking it all in is a delight, especially along King St, which has been nicknamed “the Unesco fresco”.Lunenburg is the perfect place to go kayaking. Set off from the bay at Blue Rocks, a spectacular 10-minute drive along the coast from the town of Lunenburg, and paddle through dozens of little channels out to the open sea. There’s plenty of nature around - I saw an osprey, and a huge heron. And I do love that people here spend so much time outdoors – they have everything on their doorstep.Back in Lunenburg, lunch at the Beach Pea Kitchen \u0026amp Bar  – they have some cracking fishcakes. Most restaurants here serve fish and seafood, and it’s all so beautifully fresh. Spend the rest of the day hanging out in town, just walking around and taking in the scenery and the slower pace of life. For dinner, treat yourself to lobster at the Old Fish Factory restaurant, one of the best places in town for it.Kejimkujik national park and national historic site, about an hour from Lunenburg, has got an incredible collection of petroglyphs, stories carved on rocks by the Mi’kmaq, a First Nations people, thousands of years ago. Our guide was great, and told us all about their history, and the people who’d created the carvings. The Mi’kmaw people, for instance, are credited with inventing the ice hockey stick – they are recorded as having played the game as early as the 18th century. Today, October is celebrated as Mi’kmaq history month, and the entire Mi’kmaw Nation celebrates Treaty Day annually on 1 October – the date when the Peace and Friendship treaty of 1752 was signed by the Mi’kmaq of Shubenacadie and the Brits.Peggy’s Cove is the perfect place to stretch your legs on the drive back to Halifax, and take in some amazing views of sea and sky. It’s got a strikingly elegant lighthouse, but what impressed me most were the rocks which covered the whole area – it looked like the moon, a completely alien landscape.Finish the day back in Halifax dining with locals at Edna, which stands for “eat, drink, nourish, always”. It does a mix of fish, meat and veggie dishes, and you eat at communal tables, which is fun.Start your morning with a sail around Halifax harbour on the stunning schooner Bluenose II. It’s a faithful reconstruction of the first Bluenose, a 1920s racing and fishing ship that, unfortunately, sank in 1946. We set off at full sail and got amazing views of Halifax from the water. The captain, Phil, is a great character, with a huge beard!Then it was time to do my mural the space was a stairwell at the back of the Marriott Harbourfront hotel. Normally it would take me around three days to do a piece this size (it’s around 7 x 10 metres) but we only had a day! I used inspiration from all the places I’d seen, so there were lots of muted greens to represent things like moss on the rocks at Peggy’s Cove, and mustard colours for the seaweed at Blue Rocks, then lighter notes like peppermint green for the houses in Lunenburg.For dinner, try the Bicycle Thief, a lovely, laid-back Italian restaurant. The spaghetti with meatballs is massive and delicious!The next day, before I left for the airport, I spent a few more hours finishing the mural. A lot of people helped, like a guy from the crew of the Bluenose II, who’s also a street artist. It felt great to give something to the community I hope they like it! I’d love to come back and spend more time in Nova Scotia – hopefully that’ll happen soon.Inspired to visit?

They certainly don’t need a lecture from Ofsted about how to manage relationships with parents when this is something they do on a daily basis,” Barton said.“It is vital that we support the wellbeing of teachers and leaders, and ensure that we retain the staff we need to give pupils an excellent education. Schools put a great deal of effort into this. However, Ofsted and the government are the source of much of the stress and anxiety on staff through an extremely high-pressure accountability system.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef466f132d79cc5354f26880d6d458633f8423cf/0_33_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2561be310a0001a0f005310ae796a5a1","title":"air travellers may have to pay carbon charge to offset emissions","story":"Planned tax will make public more aware of climate harm caused by flying, ministers hopeAir passengers may have to pay an extra “carbon charge” on flights as part of a government initiative to reduce CO2 emissions and tackle the climate crisis.Passengers could choose to pay more for travel tickets, which would then be used to offset greenhouse gas emissions. Or the scheme could work on an “opt-out” basis and also be applied to trains, buses and ferries.Ministers hope the plans will raise awareness about the effects of public transport on the environment. The extra funds could be used to spearhead eco-friendly projects such as planting trees to reduce the carbon footprint.The government said it hoped the initiative would “drive consumer choices towards less polluting journey options”.However, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has launched a call for evidence on offsetting carbon emissions produced by public transport. In addition, the government has expressed concerns consumers may not trust that their payments are supporting worthwhile causes.Grayling said on Thursday: “Climate change affects every one of us and we are committed to ensuring that transport plays its part in delivering net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.“An offsetting scheme could help inform travellers about how much carbon their journey produces and provide the opportunity to fund schemes, like tree planting, to compensate for those emissions. However, our focus remains to target the development, production and uptake of zero emission technology across all modes of transport.”A report by the Department for Transport said: “One way to increase uptake could be to follow an opt-out rather than opt-in model, under which the cost of offsetting carbon emissions would be automatically included for consumers.”In the past year, a third of carbon dioxide emissions came from transport alone in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f70fee9f5616fd15d1362e92e626127c55eec74/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c60c3b9c7fb6795ce171e5fd5ca66868","title":"kicking hollywood ass are stuntmen taking over the film industry","story":"With action in high demand, David Leitch, director of Hobbs \u0026amp Shaw, and Chad Stahelski are dominating cinemaTo state the obvious: one essential ingredient for a good action movie is … good action. And in an age when any old slob can be made to look like a superhero with a bit of green screen and CGI, unadulterated old-school stunts such as fist fights and car chases are in high demand. So who are you gonna call? Increasingly, the answer seems to be Leitch and Stahelski.Far from household names, David Leitch and Chad Stahelski are very well known in Hollywood. Both from martial arts backgrounds, they went into movie stunts, establishing their own company, 87eleven, in 1997. They are the people who design the stunt sequences, provide the personnel and train the actors – from Scarlett Johansson to Keanu Reeves – the latter of whom Stahelski stunt-doubled for in the Matrix movies.After doing second-unit directing on movies such as Captain America: Civil War and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, they realised they had everything they needed to make movies by themselves. So did Reeves, who asked them to direct the first John Wick in 2014. Detractors might sneer that the movie was basically one giant action sequence with a few dialogue breaks, but Stahelski and Leitch knew how to make that work, tempering the machismo with Reeves’s inherent soulfulness, and providing the slick, inventive, mordantly violent thrills that audiences crave. Stahelski went on to direct the Wick sequels while Leitch has directed Charlize Theron’s Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, and now the Fast \u0026amp Furious spin-off Hobbs \u0026amp Shaw, with Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham.Stunt performers often take pride in their unsung heroism but certain insiders have always recognised their value. No surprises that Quentin Tarantino is a stunt aficionado. His forthcoming Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood hinges on the co-dependent dynamic between a washed-up TV cowboy, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and his laidback stunt double-cum-chauffeur, Brad Pitt. Pitt has regularly required stunt doubles, specifically for Mr \u0026amp Mrs Smith where his tricky action work was performed by David Leitch.Rumour has it that Tarantino based DiCaprio and Pitt’s characters on Burt Reynolds and his long-time stunt double Hal Needham. The two were so close that Needham lived on Reynolds’s property for nearly 12 years, then directed him in action movies including The Cannonball Run and Hooper (about a Hollywood stuntman). Tarantino gave a speech when Needham became the second stunt person ever to receive an honorary Academy Award in 2012. It could be a while before Stahelski and Leitch reach such heights but things are heading in the right direction: Stahelski’s next gig is a reboot of Highlander Leitch just signed a “first-look” deal with Universal. If anyone has paid their action movie dues, it is surely them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4bffc90a00c9c0943f36f2837c0d99b534fb37e/0_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57dcba3b375d0b79f1477f9db502c534","title":"lion king disney remakes live action","story":"As The Lion King roars into cinemas, the CGI spectacle continues an ever-expanding line of flashy new takes on the studio’s library of animated classicsDisney’s new remake of The Lion King roared into theaters over the weekend, arriving as the culmination of a decade-long endeavor to revitalize (or at least squeeze a few more dollars out of) the studio’s deep library of beloved animated classics. Simba’s lesson in the art of hakuna matata marks the 10th such release, the new doctrine having been launched back in 2010 with Tim Burton’s vision of Alice in Wonderland.Going purely on dollars and cents, it’s been a fabulously successful experiment, though the question of whether it all passes muster on the grounds of entertainment merits a longer and more involved conversation. For as much as this new wave of polished-up favorites has bewitched audiences by droves, it has often left critics and more discerning viewers cold. Are these films innocently refurbishing cherished parts of our childhoods so that they might be adored by a new generation, or is this the work of a corporate colossus intent on wringing every last dollar out of its stable of characters no matter the creative compromise required?To land on an answer – as with most things, it’s somewhere in the middle – the  took a deep e into the current era of Disney and compiled the ranking below. From the most dismal cash-in to an exhilarating rework inspiring hope for the future, here’s the full lowdown:If 2010’s previous adventure with Alice represented a new low of creative coasting for director Burton, its sequel marks the complete cannibalizing of his technique as an auteur. James Bobin steps in to fill the vacuum of talent left behind when Burton shifted to producer, mostly by aping the most superficial elements of his predecessor’s work – goth-lite flourishes, outré couture, a possibly fatal overdose of whimsy – in a diluted form. Piling on mythologies that even Lewis Carroll might have found a touch convoluted, Bobin sends Alice on a bland time-traveling journey through a realm of incoherent digitized glop to save Johnny Depp’s Mad Hatter, a character the film greatly overestimates as worth saving. The six-year gap between installments really emphasizes how little this was needed, and lays bare the money-minded imperatives fueling Disney’s collective remake project.After spinning a massive payday out of The Jungle Book, Jon Favreau returned to the House of Mouse for another photorealist fantasy with a core cast out of the kingdom Animalia. Chalk it up to laziness or reverence for the original, but this time around, Favreau nearly went shot-by-shot in his recreation of the 1994 masterpiece. The result of this experiment in boundary-pushing animation technology is an eyesore utterly devoid of imagination, exuberance or any signs of life. The simple inability of the animal characters to emote causes plenty of trouble add to that a sleepy voice performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, the fact that Can You Feel the Love Tonight? takes place during the day and a disappointing paucity of Beyoncé. It’s an unattractive and joyless film, seemingly for no one.The harrowing sight of a gigantic cerulean Will Smith will haunt youngsters for years to come, and yet there’s little else memorable about Guy Ritchie’s take on the Arabian Nights folktale. He stages the musical numbers that haven’t been tossed by the wayside with some panache, but directs the intervening passages with minimal distinction. Ritchie’s spent his whole career choreographing and capturing fleet-footed chases, and now that he has got the full arsenal of Disney’s resources at his disposal to follow Aladdin (Mena Massoud), he pulls off the throttle? Saturday Night Live alum Nasim Pedrad’s amusing supporting turn as a handmaiden pretty much cancels out a dull and creakily pseudo-feminist slant on princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott), leaving little else to savor. Meanwhile, Smith’s streetwise genie pales in comparison to Robin Williams’ nonstop barrage of schtick, one big shape-shifting flaw in the new film’s comedic bedrock, though the end credits rap from the former Big Willie Style straddles the line of being so bad it circles back to good again.Emma Watson took one of her infrequent acting jobs to breathe new life into Belle, making the kept woman into something sturdier. Even so, her princess-in-spite-of-herself can’t hold a singing candle to the original, and her nonhuman companions don’t come off looking much better. This is where we start to see Disney losing its way in terms of CGI design, even as the studio made its execution more sophisticated than ever Cogsworth, Lumiere, Mrs Potts and the rest of the domestic-furnishing crew lose all their visual warmth and charm in pursuit of a more realistic standard. Not to mention the Dan Stevens-played Beast, looking less like a mammalian hunk and more like a failed genetic experiment. Both he and Watson put their best foot forward, and despite their sincerest efforts, the film often feels like an imitation at once chintzy and overly expensive. Burton’s first dalliance with Disney stands out as the patient zero to which this whole trend can be traced back, its highly lucrative transmogrifying of intellectual property putting dollar signs in executives’ eyes for the rest of the 10s. But to make this deal with the devil, the one-time ambassador to the morose Hot Topic set made some glaring artistic concessions placing him in line with a much duller channel of the mainstream. The German Expressionist influence has vanished, replaced by torrents of garbled digital imagery and washed-out color schemes distorting light’s brilliance and the shadows it casts. As young Alice turns warrior in the Joseph Campbell mode, Mia Wasikowska lets everyone know how good she could be in a vehicle making proper use of her skills and screen presence. The rest of the colorful supporting turns shake out as hit-or-miss, with more in the former category (Alan Rickman’s hookah-smoking caterpillar, a hysterical Helena Bonham Carter as the bigheaded Queen of Hearts) than the latter (Johnny Depp’s grating Mad Hatter, Anne Hathaway’s miscalculated White Queen).Burton got a little bit of the old spirit back with his most recent Disney collaboration, undoubtedly aided by the casting of regular pal Danny DeVito as the grumbling manager of a barely solvent circus. The milieu, with its vertical stripes and elaborate outfits and harsh footlights, came well-suited to the director’s house style. Regardless, he could do little to salvage a thoroughly mangled script foregrounding two exquisitely annoying human kids while shunting Dumbo himself off to a tertiary role. (Though the film’s glaring subtext – that corporate conglomeration is bad, kiddos, killing art and precipitating cutbacks – comes as a bracing tonic in the wake of Disney’s gobbling-up of Fox.) While clearing the bar he had set for himself with his take on Alice and Co, Burton gave away just how low it had been placed, as his film contains scarcely an iota of the original’s frightening surrealism. The high-gloss approximation of the pink elephant scene does a disservice to the nightmarish quality of its forefather.Casting Angelina Jolie and her superhuman cheekbones as the nefarious queen tormenting Sleeping Beauty qualifies as a stroke of genius, though it’s not quite enough to carry this revisionist take on the fairytale. She offers an alternative portrait of the villain steeped in the tragic, a backstory in which she’s wronged by a cruel man, defamed as a vindictive woman, and only restored to power through embracing the reputation assigned to her. It all sounds significantly more interesting than it turns out to be, possibly because this is a grown-up character study forced to contort itself into the shape of a fun-for-the-family blockbuster. The interior character work that undoubtedly attracted Jolie to the job takes a back seat to flashy trailer-ready moments, though the idea it leaves behind (that some of history’s most loathed women were secretly the victims behind the scenes) can endure.Another Favreau production with lifelike talking animals, a dearth of musical numbers, and a verdant setting overflowing with life – what did he do right here that would go so horribly awry just three years later? For one, this film illustrates the tantamount importance of having a human actor in the lead, his expressive appearance a crucial mirror reflecting back the tone of the animals’ dialogue. With newcomer Neel Sethi as Mowgli, the reaction shot (a fairly fundamental unit of film-making) becomes a possibility. There has been more thought put into the voice casting as well, from Bill Murray’s lackadaisical delivery as Baloo to Scarlett Johansson mesmerizing croon as the hypnoserpent Kaa. But the film truly excels by allowing itself to slow down and take it easy, adopting the leisurely pace and emphasis on the easy life that entrenched the earlier film in its year of 1967. Even if Favreau overwrites the look of the film, he has the good sense not to dispose of its spirit.Kenneth Branagh’s no stranger to spectacle, it’s just that he usually gets his grandeur from the backlog of the Bard instead of Walt Disney. His style of stately opulence fit the storybook subject matter like a glass slipper, revitalizing the kingdom and its inhabitants with ravishing costumes and production design befitting the monarchy. Lily James holds it together as our riches-to-rags-to-riches-again heroine, but the real star of the show has to be Cate Blanchett, who spices up the role of the evil stepmother with a dash of Norma Desmond and a sprinkle of the Wicked Witch. While the computer-animated pumpkin carriage lacks the magic of the genuine article, the additional attempts to update or otherwise modernize do little to disrupt the bedtime fable atmosphere viewers can still feel nostalgic about.Director David Lowery may be the only one to have realized the full potential of Disney’s remake campaign, starting from square one to completely reshape the given property into a fully-formed work with its own fresh themes and aesthetic – you know, a real movie. Lowery followed the studio’s marching orders to swap out the 1977 live-actionanimation hybrid’s hand-drawn creature for a CGI creation and ditch the songs, but he still tapped into the spirit of youth with a purity unseen in the rest of this small canon. His film exudes such tenderness, such kindness, such freeness that the experience of watching it makes the viewer feel like a child at play.In the Pacific north-west (a lush prelapsarian Eden in cool greens and browns, as depicted through cinematographer Bojan Bazelli’s earthy lensing), an orphaned boy escapes into the beckoning forest and finds refuge with a gentle reptilian colossus. The bond between them, developed in a handful of scenes wisely left free of any dialogue to get in the way, resembles that of a boy and his dog, offspring and parent, kid and best friend. It’s threatened by a logger (gamely played by box-chinned Karl Urban), a harbinger of environmental destruction in direct opposition to kindly old man-of-the-woods Robert Redford. Their clash claims the survival of the natural world as its stakes, an analog for the eternal push and pull between our better angels and the darker sides of ourselves. It’s mature content packaged in a way children can understand, kiddie entertainment done right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96fb66c79369dbb98941f070620007a0e676c6bc/144_103_2995_1796/master/2995.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d033e8e6e9076754cf7097c784a6ab33","title":"natalie portman confirmed as mighty thor in marvel sequel","story":"Actor will reprise Dr Jane Foster character who takes on Thor’s powers in Thor: Love and ThunderNatalie Portman will take up the mantle of Thor in the upcoming Marvel sequel Thor: Love and Thunder, announced on Saturday.Stars Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, and director Taika Waititi, will also return from 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok, and Portman will reprise her character of Dr Jane Foster, who debuted in the 2011 original.

Press into a flat disc and wrap with clingfilm. Chill for 30-45 minutes. If you have to chill it longer, it will be fine but you will need to let it soften slightly before rolling out. When you’re ready, roll the pastry out to a few millimetres thickness. I like to roll rye pastry thicker than normal pastry because it is more brittle but also because it can handle being thicker without seeming stodgy.Heat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4.

Remove and make the filling.Whisk together all of the filling ingredients except the cheese. Pour through a sieve and set aside.Fill the pre-baked rye pastry shell with the roasted tomatoes. Dot with large chunks of the cheese and pour over the strained custard mix. Drizzle with any remaining tomato juices. Place on a tray in the middle of your oven (still at 180Cgas mark 4) and bake for about 25-30 minutes. This is a shallow quiche so it bakes quite quickly.

Cool slightly and serve with a leafy salad.Claire Ptak is the owner of Violet Cakes, London E8 Traditionally, for pan con tomate people used bread that was a day or two old, which would come to life with the juice of the tomato. My favourite is pan de coca (a Catalan flatbread) or alternatively pan de payés (country loaf), or a slice of sourdough. In the Basque country they often use a baguette, though this wouldn’t be my first choice, as once rubbed with tomato the soft texture can become too pasty. Look for bread with a good crust and quite an open airy texture – not dense and solid – that will crisp up nicely if you are toasting it. Industrial sliced bread won’t do, as it will just become a mush.You also need good olive oil, something fruity but not overpowering, such as Arbequina, which will complement the sweetness of the tomato. Use as much as you like, but remember that you might end up with oil running down your arm as you eat.Inevitably, there is always an argument over which of the few ingredients should go on to the bread or toast first. At home the way we do it is to toast a pile of good bread, then put out the halved tomatoes, cut cloves of garlic (for those who want them), a bottle of good extra virgin olive oil and some sea salt, and let everyone help themselves. If you are happy using your fingers this is really the best way, however messy.If you are using garlic I would say only do so if the bread is toasted, and then rub it on before the tomato, as the roughness of the toast’s surface gives you something to grate the cloves against, and it will embed itself better if the bread is not already soaked in tomato. Next I would squeeze the juice into the toast until it is coloured bright red and all that is left of the tomatoes is their skin. Ideally, you will have more juice than flesh on the toast, so it looks as if it has been painted red.Some say salt should come next, then oil, as this helps the salt to impregnate the bread, but I like to drizzle on the oil first and rub it in, then scatter on sea salt, as I love the crunch it gives.Eat straight away, neat, or with whatever topping you like, from slices of cured ham or sausage to anchovies, or manchego cheese. Freshly cooked kippers are good too.From Brindisa: The True Food of Spain by Monika Linton (Fourth Estate, £29.95)When the Chinese of the coastal provinces first encountered the tomato, it reminded them of more familiar fruits and vegetables, which is why it became known as a “barbarian aubergine” or a “Western red persimmon”. Here, then, is a recipe for “barbarian aubergines” stir-fried with eggs, which I ate every other day when I lived in Sichuan. It’s beautiful, with its vivid mix of red and yellow, and seems much more delicious than the sum of its parts. I’ve given a recipe for two eggs and two tomatoes, which you can increase by an egg and tomato or two if you please. The potato flour mixture, if added, gives an extra luxuriousness to the juices, but isn’t strictly necessary.Serves 1ripe tomatoes 2, similar in volume to the eggseggs 2 saltcooking oil 4 tbsp caster sugar ½ tsp potato flour ½ tsp mixed with 2 tsp water (optional)Cut each tomato in half, then into sections the size of tangerine segments. Beat the eggs evenly together with a little salt.Heat 3 tbsp of the oil in a seasoned wok over a high flame. Add the beaten eggs and swirl them around. Use a wok scoop or a ladle to nudge the edges of the egg towards the centre, so the uncooked egg can run out. As soon as the egg has set (it may be a little golden), remove it from the wok.Return the wok to the high flame with the final 1 tbsp oil if you need it. Tip in the tomatoes and stir-fry until they are hot and smell cooked and delicious, adding the sugar and salt to taste. Then return the eggs to the wok and mix everything together. Add the potato flour mixture, if using, and serve.From Every Grain of Rice by Fuschia Dunlop (Bloomsbury Publishing, £25)The year-long warm climate in Mexico means plump, sun-ripened tomatoes are always available so you will see fresh tomatoes – never tinned – used.

Remove the cooked chicken from the broth and, when cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin and bones. Tear the chicken into shreds. Set aside. Strain and reserve the stock.Finely slice the remaining onion. Add 100ml olive oil to a pan and sauté the onions until translucent. Remove from the heat and reserve.Prepare 1kg of tomatoes by removing (and reserving) the centre and the seeds of the tomatoes. Slice the rest of the flesh into short thin strips and set aside for later. In a blender add 500ml of reserved chicken stock, the remaining 4 garlic cloves and the reserved tomato centres and seeds. Roughly chop the remaining plum tomatoes and add to the blender.

This is the effect known as jet lag. Symptoms include tiredness, headaches, nausea and diarrhoea.It takes our bodies one day to adjust to a time difference of one hour, so Gardiner recommends pre-emptively adjusting our clocks at home: one hour a day towards the time zone to which you are travelling, no more than three days before travelling. “If the duration of travel is less than the number of time zones you travel across, you need to plan – getting your body used to the new time zone will help you adjust much faster.”“Diet plays a large part in setting the body clock,” says Lisa Artis, an adviser at the Sleep Council, which promotes healthy sleep habits. “Once you are on the plane, set your watch to the local time at your destination, then eat according to normal meal times at your destination.” Heavy meals increase our sleep drive, so a balanced diet helps kickstart our body clock into its destination timings.Be sure to drink plenty of water. Gardiner says that our body clocks can be set off-kilter by dehydration. “People don’t drink enough water on planes and often replace it with alcohol, which is a depressant and dehydrating, or they drink too much caffeine, which keeps you awake,” she says. “Your body needs to re-adjust naturally to its new time zone and it’s not advisable to manipulate it.”Dr Guy Meadows, a co-founder of the insomnia treatment service Sleep School, recommends getting 20 to 30 minutes of natural light exposure the morning after arriving at your destination. “Our body clocks are connected to light-receptive cells in our eyes, so making sure to darken down throughout the day is a very powerful way of synchronising with your new environment,” he says.If you are adamant about avoiding jet lag, travelling west – and therefore lengthening your day by going backwards through time zones – will alleviate the symptoms. Timings your flights is also important – Meadows says that we need at least 10 hours of wakefulness to induce a restful sleep. Factoring this into your flight time, and arriving after sunset, will help adjust your schedule."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce8390412a8690ffc32d4f06019cc9dcc1645fb9/1_0_3273_1964/master/3273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66cf8971b6ecf70bd8b34c5313281a28","title":"my oestrogen levels were all over the place when men have sympathy pregnancies","story":"From morning sickness to a swollen belly, some expectant fathers say they share their partners’ symptoms. But how is that possible?Kirsten, 22, knew something strange was happening at about eight weeks into her pregnancy. The classic first trimester symptoms, such as weight gain, food aversions and nausea, were all arriving as expected – but she wasn’t the only one affected.Her partner, Silas, 23, was experiencing similar physical shifts. He started gaining weight and felt repelled by familiar foods. As Kirsten’s morning sickness took hold, he was struck with equally debilitating nausea. “I felt sick every day for weeks,” he says.Initially, Kirsten was sceptical. She worried that Silas’s symptoms were an elaborate joke, or that he was being insensitive. “But, as time went on, I realised he was truly suffering,” she says. “The nausea was the worst of it. He had it much worse than I did. I ended up sharing my morning sickness medication with him so he could get through the day.”Silas’s experience was no freak phenomenon. He had Couvade syndrome, otherwise known as a “sympathy pregnancy”. The mysterious – yet surprisingly common – condition causes pregnant women’s partners to manifest the physical and psychological symptoms of pregnancy. Those with the syndrome report abdominal pain, morning sickness, bloating and lethargy, as well as mood swings, memory loss and depression. In more extreme cases, they can even experience pseudocyesis, in which their stomach swells throughout their partner’s pregnancy, only to begin retracting after the birth.For Kalu, 25, the symptoms were brief, but all-consuming. During the first trimester of his partner’s pregnancy, he struggled with extreme anxiety and nausea. “My stomach was twisting and turning,” he says. “I was throwing up for days. The only thing I could eat were liquids, such as water and fruit smoothies.”It is easy to dismiss these men as simply being melodramatic, especially when you compare Couvade syndrome with the intense physical strain of a real pregnancy. Perhaps that is why there has been so little research into the causes.“I don’t think that people understand the nature of the disorder,” says Dr Arthur Brennan, a senior lecturer in nursing at Kingston University, who has written several research papers on the condition. “It sort of straddles the boundaries between a mental disorder and a physical disorder. It doesn’t fit tidily into one or the other category.”Couvade syndrome may not be limited to heterosexual human couples, although they make up the majority of the reported cases. Dr Bartlomiej Piechowski-Jozwiak, a neurologist at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, says the most severe case of Couvade syndrome he has ever heard of came via a vet: “A woman developed a variant of Couvade syndrome triggered by her dog’s pregnancy: she had all the symptoms of the syndrome, and she knew she was not pregnant.”So what does cause Couvade syndrome? For a long time, it was believed to be purely psychological. Some early explanations, rooted in psychoanalytic theory, suggested that the symptoms were born out of a man’s envy of the woman’s ability to procreate. Others suggested it could be a way of erting attention back to the man, who can feel irrelevant or marginalised during pregnancy.But more recent studies have suggested that Couvade syndrome could be linked to empathy and attachment. Symptoms, it seems, are more prevalent in men with greater investment in their unborn baby, and increased involvement in the pregnancy.This was the case for Mike, 32. The tattoo artist had Couvade syndrome with all three of his partner Amanda’s pregnancies, experiencing morning sickness, pseudocyesis, exhaustion and heightened emotions. He believes it may have been down to the couple’s closeness. “We breathe each other’s air constantly,” he says. “We own a couple of businesses together, we live together, we work together and we have children together, so we’re very close. We also spend a lot of our free time together, too, because we’re friends.”There are potential physical explanations for Couvade syndrome. What we know from the very few studies that have been carried out so far is that men’s hormonal levels shift significantly during the antenatal period. Testosterone tends to diminish, while oestrogen and prolactin rise.“I’d say my oestrogen levels were all over the place when Amanda was pregnant,” says Mike. “I was an emotional wreck.”“My training regime practically stopped because I didn’t feel like I had the urge or energy. I’m quite a testosterone-y bloke: I’m mad on the gym, and I train hard and often. But when Amanda is pregnant, that just stops. My ‘want’ just disappears. I just get emotional and lazy, and eat cake.”“A number of studies have found that testosterone is lower,” Brennan agrees, “whereas prolactin tends to rise. The link, or the apparent trigger, is found in men who had the greatest concern or responsiveness to the unborn baby. Possibly, this could be to do with empathy, but it could be due to anxiety as well.”But for those with Couvade syndrome, it’s not really about finding answers. Instead, the priority is removing the stigma that surrounds the condition, and for it to be acknowledged as a legitimate part of the pregnancy process.“I don’t really think it’s a cause for research,” says Mike. “Obviously, some people may take the piss, or say I’m trying to steal the thunder from Amanda’s pregnancies. And, yeah, they are her pregnancies, but I can’t deny what’s going on.”If anything, he says, the syndrome should be celebrated as a symbol of intimacy between two parents (the couple are now working on a book about how to stay close during pregnancy, which they credit to the experience). “Couvade syndrome taught me to be more compassionate to have more understanding of what it was Amanda was going through – not just physically but mentally,” he says. “Maybe Couvade syndrome will give men more of an understanding of what a woman goes through when she pushes her body to its limits.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59e50977069728d6155d217c88e141aa2501ce0/0_18_4904_2944/master/4904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc1052292384ee91932455652a219d97","title":"has brexit saved the lib dems","story":"The Lib Dems have made an extraordinary comeback in 2019 because of their anti-Brexit stance.

As well as receiving the latest updates from ministers and officials, the meeting will discuss the maintenance of the security of shipping in the Gulf. Hunt is due to make a statement to MPs on Monday afternoon.Senior Tory backbenchers including figures close to Boris Johnson, who is expected to become prime minister this week, are angry at the government’s reluctance to accept an offer from Washington to protect British vessels in the region. The capture of the Stena Impero on Friday was widely seen as an avoidable error for which ministers had ample warning.Iain Duncan Smith, a former minister tipped for a cabinet post in a Johnson administration, said the government needed urgently to answer the charge that it had made an error. He said genuine questions had been raised about the UK’s contingency planning after the UK seized the Iranian tanker, Grace 1, on 4 July. “If something didn’t send an alarm signal that we needed to have serious assets or protection and convoying of our vessels in that area then I want to know why not.”Duncan Smith said his sources had suggested Washington had invited the UK “to use US assets to support British shipping and they were not taken up at that point.” He said he wanted to know why additional UK assets were not speedily dispatched.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran resuming higher uranium enrichment.The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast \u0027were subjected to sabotage operations\u0027.Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.Saudi Arabia blames Iran for the drone attack on its pipeline.A rocket lands near the US embassy in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, without harming anyone.

Never threaten the United States again!\u0027Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom\u0027s south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift. 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US \u0027spy\u0027 drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDonald Trump reportedly gives approval for the US military to launch strikes on Iran in retaliation for the loss of the drone, before pulling back at the last minute.The Iranian and US presidents trade insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a “mental disorder” and Trump once more threatening Iran with “obliteration”.Iran summons UK ambassador over an incident off Gibraltar as Royal Marines seize a tanker the UK suspects of carrying oil to Syria.The UK government says three Iranian boats were warned off by the frigate HMS Montrose after Iranian boats \u0027attempted to impede\u0027 a British oil tanker in strait of Hormuz. Tehran denies involvement.In a major escalation, Iran seizes the Stena Impero, a British-flagged tanker, off its coast. Iranian officials later make it clear that the capture was in retaliation for the capture of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 earlier in July.Hunt is expected to announce limited sanctions directed against members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and to say that the UK is willing to join an international protection force on the right terms. It will also send air assets to the region.On Sunday evening, the Foreign Office confirmed Hunt had spoken with his French and German counterparts who agreed that a “safe passage for vessels” through the economically significant Strait of Hormuz was “a top priority” for Europe.The Foreign Office is seeking a diplomatic solution to the conflict but has advised all British-flagged ships not to enter the Strait of Hormuz.Bob Sanguinetti, the chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, said: “We must restore confidence in the security of ships passing through the strait, and if this necessitates the deployment of more naval vessels from the international community, we would welcome that.”The Iranian government said the length of detention of the mainly Indian crew on Stena Impero depended on the degree of their cooperation. “We are required by regulations to investigate the issue,” Allahmorad Afifipour, the head of ports and maritime in Hormozgan province, told Iranian state TV.Afifipour said all 23 crew members from the ship were “safe and in good health”. The ship’s owners have asked to visit the crew.Iranian MPs meeting on Sunday welcomed the ship’s capture and made calls for the government to consider imposing tolls on all British and US shipping heading to the Strait, a move that would lead to naval confrontations since the strait is considered international waters.Iranian officials were explicit that the capture on Friday was in retaliation for the capture of Grace 1. The speaker of Iran’s parliament, Ali Larijani, said the British “stole and got a response” from the Revolutionary Guards.Britain privately admits it worked in conjunction with the US in the capture of Grace 1 but says it had independent intelligence that the ship contained oil bound for Syria, in violation of EU sanctions. It says the ship could not have been stopped had it not entered Gibraltarian waters.The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst \u0027chokepoint\u0027In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.It is possible ministers underestimated the reaction, particularly since Iran did not attempt any reprisal when the British – unlike the French or Germans – blamed the Revolutionary Guards for an attack on two tankers last month.One Whitehall source admitted the government had considered turning a blind eye, admitting that an unworthy part of him had thought: “Let this cup pass from my lips.”Ellwood again demanded the release of the Stena Impero, a call echoed by Oman in whose waters the ship was captured.Speaking on Sky News, Elwood also made a stark call for a reversal of defence cuts. He said: “If we want to continue playing a role on the international stage – bearing in mind that threats are changing, all happening just beneath the threshold of all-out war – then we must invest more in our defence.”Britain has been nervous of the rules of engagement of the US’s long-touted plan for an international maritime security force, nicknamed Operation Sentinel. There is already a UN-endorsed anti-piracy operation off the coast of Somalia, while combined taskforces already operate in the Gulf, dedicated to security and fighting drug-smuggling.There are also issues about the funding of any new larger operation proposed by US Central Command. But, most of all, Britain fears US-led convoys in the Gulf could by accident turn from something passive and defensive into something more volatile.Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, said on Sunday that the US national security adviser, John Bolton, “having failed to lure Donald Trump into war of the century … is turning his venom against the UK in hopes of dragging it into a quagmire.”Iran’s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, said on Twitter that Britain needed to contain “those domestic political forces who want to escalate existing tension between Iran and the UK well beyond the issue of ships”. There is an awareness in Iranian circles that the a Johnson premiership could lead to the UK weakening its support for the nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew last year.Meanwhile Iran said it had arrested 17 Iranian nationals allegedly recruited by the CIA to spy on the country’s nuclear and military sites. Some of them have already been sentenced to death, Tehran claimed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2947f3087a8292e14525d943b1f9811dd509e9c8/0_330_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f7ff4422dedf1dc8fdd2a6461189a0e","title":"mystery of chedworth 1800 year old roman glass shard solved","story":"Find sheds fresh light on wealth and influence of ex-inhabitants of National Trust propertyA fragment from a Roman bottle so exceptionally rare that it has taken glass experts from around the world two years to conclusively identify it has been discovered thousands of miles from where it was made.The discovery at Chedworth Roman Villa in Gloucestershire of the small shard of patterned green glass, part of an 1,800-year-old fish bottle, has astonished archaeologists.Nothing like it has ever been found in Britain. It would have been made in an area around the Black Sea in what is now Ukraine and was possibly used to hold exotic perfume.For it to travel all the way from the Black Sea to the Cotswolds sheds new light on the wealth and influence of the people who occupied Chedworth, a National Trust property regarded as one of the grandest Roman villas in Britain.Nancy Grace, the National Trust archaeologist who led the work to investigate the find, said it had puzzled lots of people. “People have been enchanted by it, but it has also been a long and difficult journey,” she said. “To have found that it is the only one of its type so far discovered in Roman Britain adds to our knowledge of the importance of Chedworth Roman Villa.”It is known that the villa was home to somebody of wealth and status. The fabulously exotic fish bottle from so far away “underlines that the occupants were in touch with the furthest regions of the Roman Empire and wanted to show off that influence. It is amazing that a small fragment has told us so much.”The shard was found in the summer of 2017 but it has taken until now to identify the type of bottle is came from because of its rarity. It was sent to one of the leading experts in Roman glass, the late professor Jennifer Price, who in turn sought advice from other glass experts around the world.The distinctive profile of the glass indicated it came from a long bottle with an oval shape and a sharp taper at the end. Price eventually found it matched a restored fish-shaped bottle in the collection of the Corning Museum of Glass in New York.In an indication of its rarity, the only other example of a Roman fish bottle comes from a 2AD burial at Chersonesus in Crimea.Price died in May but Grace said she could tell how much she was enjoying solving the mystery of the Chedworth glass shard. And she solved it, with her research published in the latest edition of the specialist newsletter, Glass News.The fragment was found by Peter Moore, an archaeologist and masters student at the University of York who was helping with a dig at the villa. He said he would never forget the moment he found it, realising straight away it was something special.“Knowing that you are the first person to gaze upon it for at least 1,800 years is a feeling that never tires,” he said. “Recovering such a unique find is incredibly humbling.”The trust commissioned the archaeological illustrator Maggie Foottit to produce an impression of how the complete fish bottle may have looked.The fragment is going on display at the villa from Tuesday as part of the villa’s festival of archaeology and will remain on display throughout the summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ccfcc48300254953530c8e890a9fa488dadbb8a/0_348_1903_1142/master/1903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3182cc9786d13c25bad70deda936c6de","title":"why nba stars like james harden and lebron james invest in football clubs","story":"Even though MLS clubs cannot compete with the other US sports leagues in terms of income, soccer is seen as a growing market for wealthy athlete-investorsJames Harden’s summer of soccer continues. Earlier this month, the 2018 NBA Most Valuable Player had a kickaround at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium. And he was at NRG Stadium in Houston on Saturday, enjoying Bayern Munich’s 3-1 win over Real Madrid while his new club picked up three points in Toronto. Two days prior, the Houston Dynamo and Houston Dash announced that Harden has purchased a minority stake in the group that controls the MLS and NWSL clubs and their 22,000-capacity stadium.In simpler and less lucrative times, sports stars might have been content to open a memorabilia-filled steakhouse or bar in the cities where they became local legends. Now they are so wealthy – Harden’s salary for the coming season is $38m – that they have asset managers and strategic investment portfolios.Harden sees the Houston deal as a way to deepen his relationship with the city where he became a megastar while tapping into a growing league in the world’s biggest sport. “It was time,” Harden said in a message recorded in the Dynamo’s locker room. “I’m invested, this is my city and I’m here, I’m here to stay. I know I need to bring a championship in basketball and I will, that’s coming very, very soon, but I just had to show my appreciation and let you guys know that I’m a part of the city and I’m here forever, so I’m a part of the Dynamo, we’re going to take this thing to another level.”The deal is “another opportunity to expand my brand globally, over these last four or five years I became very passionate about soccer so it made perfect sense,” he told Fox local news on Saturday.Harden was traded from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Houston Rockets in 2012, becoming the face (and the facial hair) of the franchise. He is not known to be a regular at Dynamo or Dash matches, but has long been a fan of the Fifa video game series, which helped deepen his interest in football. So has his link with Adidas – he met Paul Pogba at Old Trafford in 2016 on a marketing trip to Europe.The Houston deal has strong Californian links. The Dynamo’s majority owner is Gabriel Brener, a Mexico-born businessman whose investment company is based in Los Angeles. One of the other owners is Oscar De La Hoya, the former boxer, who, like Harden, was born in LA. Among Harden’s advisors is True Capital Management, a wealth management firm headquartered in San Francisco that has more than 200 current and former sportspeople as clients. The company helped set up a meeting.“Really it started with a get-together between the ownership group and him and just feeling out if there was a mutual connection to put a partnership together. They offered him the opportunity to invest in a minority position in the team and we were instrumental in the process of helping to pull the terms together,” Doug Raetz, the CEO of True Capital Management, told the . He declined to discuss the details of the agreement.Harden has earned more than $148m in wages during his decade in the NBA, while in 2017 he signed a then NBA-record $228m contract extension to the end of the 2022-23 season. Endorsements add significantly to his wealth: in 2015 he agreed a long-term shoe deal with Adidas worth a reported $200m. The Dynamo, meanwhile, have the lowest annual payroll in MLS, as of June – under $8m for the entire squad. It is easy to see why the Dynamo are excited about the potential for Harden’s star power to lift the club’s profile – he has 9.8m followers on Instagram and 6.3m on Twitter, dwarfing their own 423,000 and MLS’s 3.3m. Houston’s 3-1 win over Toronto FC on Saturday keeps them firmly in playoff contention, but their crowds have declined in recent seasons and the current average, 15,557, is 19th in the 24-team competition. That number looks especially modest given that Houston is the fifth-biggest metropolitan area in the US, with about seven million residents.With rising player wages but only four teams with average attendances over 25,000 so far this season and broadcast income still paltry by the standards of the top European leagues, it is hard for MLS teams to make an operating profit. But franchises are increasingly valuable, with demand so high that the league is charging new entrants a $200m expansion fee.Stadiums, like other pieces of real estate, can soar in value. And perhaps most importantly, MLS’s commercial arm, Soccer United Marketing, is likely to become even more powerful and profitable in the run-up to North America’s hosting of the 2026 World Cup.“MLS we believe has a huge future here in the US and we think it’s on the early runway of something very, very big. I think the trends of youth soccer are looking unbelievable and it’s early in the league’s history but the trend is going in the right direction and it’s being supported by the valuations that you’re starting to see in these various teams and the new franchise fees that are out there,” Raetz said.“A number of retired athletes have been around the space and have showed interest but for an active player like James to get involved I think is groundbreaking.”As LeBron James put it to the Wall Street Journal in 2011: “The first time I stepped on an NBA court I became a businessman.” Whether or not Harden’s MLS gambit pans out, there’s always the sports drinks, the skincare range and the socks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abf3f5aa0b0ca7327c7b4962a2151c2e7e6a8e65/0_368_2128_1277/master/2128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5768ed8989c7a083492c801bfb0fc60c","title":"shane lowry wins open","story":"They were nervous at the 1st, and so was he. The ovation they gave Shane Lowry when he stepped out to begin the final round of the 148th Open soon settled down into an uneasy silence. Lowry is an anxious man. He has said it himself. Back in 2016 he got so stressed about organising the guest list for his wedding that he and his fiancée decided they were better off eloping to New York instead. It was later that same year he blew a four-shot lead in the last round of the US Open at Oakmont. Everyone remembered that one and, even if they had tried to forget it, Brooks Koepka, seven shots back, had made a point of reminding them what happened “the last time Shane had the lead” on Saturday night.And then Lowry flared his opening drive wide left into the ugly rough while his partner, and good pal, Tommy Fleetwood, whistled his straight down the middle. Fleetwood’s second was even better, and set up a 12ft putt for birdie. Lowry, on the other hand, lumped his into the cavernous front bunker, so deep that he disappeared into it. His escape shot looked, for a second, as though it would run on right up to the pin, but it caught on a ridge in the middle of the green and spun right back down the way it came. It left him needing to make a long putt for par, which he missed, and then a shorter one, from 8ft, just to make his bogey.The night before, in the moments after his magical 63, Lowry had tried to explain how his game had changed in the months since he missed the cut in the Open last year. It wasn’t what he was doing, he said, but the way he was doing it. “I play golf now like there’s no consequences,” he explained, “like, what’s the worst thing that can happen? If I swing the club here and hit the ball, no matter where it goes, what is the worst thing that can happen to you?” Well, as he stood over that bogey putt, facing up to the prospect of a two-shot swing, it felt like he was about to find out.Lowry needed this one. And when he got it, the crowd erupted around him. There can’t have been a bogey‑five that has ever been celebrated quite like it. In that moment Lowry had confronted the worst, come close enough to it to get a good look, and now he had faced it down. With that, everything began to turn around. He would not play so badly again all day – and Fleetwood would not get so close to his lead again, either.So four hours later, Lowry arrived on the 18th six shots clear, followed by the raucous thousands, who came in pell-mell behind him as the stewards dropped the ropes and let them flood on to the fairway to watch the big finish. It was not the largest crowd the Open has ever had – there was one bigger, at St Andrews in 2000 – but it was surely the loudest. But then they have been waiting for this a long time. This was the first time they have had the Open here in 68 years. It would have come sooner, but for the Troubles. And without stretching the point, it felt significant that the Open ended with all those Northern Irish fans cheering on a golfer from Offaly, the son of an All-Ireland title-winning Gaelic footballer, no less.They were generous to Fleetwood, too. They had been cheering them both on all day long, like it was a Ryder Cup tie. Fleetwood and Lowry are good friends, and they had been looking out for each other. They started the round with a firm hug, and finished it the same way. And when Fleetwood, utterly dejected, made his way on to the 18th green, Lowry’s caddie Bo Martin ordered all the merry Irish fans to pipe down their singing and chanting with a wave of his hand. They fell entirely quiet and let Fleetwood play out the last two strokes of his round, and gave him a loud round of applause when he had.The miracle was that there was so many of them there to watch, because by the middle of the afternoon the weather was so atrocious you could not necessarily have guessed where they were playing, or which part of the country it was in, since the town all around had disappeared into the low, black rainclouds that had blown in.All you knew was that it was clearly some place where the locals were so crazy about the game that they thought these were fit conditions in which to be out watching golf. Any place, were they sensible, they would all have been shut up indoors with the curtains drawn, but here there were plenty striding about in shirts and shorts.A lot of them did not even have tickets but were up on the sand dunes, or along the roads running over the nearby hills – there was, astonishingly, even someone bobbing about in the sea who seemed to be trying to film it all on his mobile phone. They filled every last spot where they could feasibly catch a glimpse of this unlikely victory. It was only last year that Lowry lost his PGA Tour card because he had had such a bad run, six missed cuts, and not so much as a single top‑10 finish. “I failed in America,” he said then. Back here at home, he has succeeded in the most brilliant fashion, and, for this one week at least, brought a lot of people here together to watch him do it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e12f9b3d676fdd915ae359a2c9086c72c7ec1772/0_166_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbab3fdc288cc1d52d6d19075632fe7e","title":"talking horses bookmakers accused of offering unrealistic odds on enable","story":"John Gosden says odds of 4-6 on his star shows that bookmakers ‘don’t want anyone backing’ her at the King GeorgeJohn Gosden has said that Enable faces “a tall order” in trying to win Saturday’s King George VI \u0026amp Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, despite being a hot favourite in the betting.

He thinks that this is partly a consequence of her jockey, Frankie Dettori, winning four races on a single day at Royal Ascot last month, when bookmakers lost heavily to punters backing his mounts in accumulators. It could have been still more expensive for bookies, had Dettori won the Britannia on Turgenev, as briefly seemed likely.“I was told that if Frankie hadn’t got carried away down at the two and a half furlong marker in the Britannia that day, we could have had a couple of institutions with rather a large hole under the waterline,” Gosden added. “So I’m sure that pricing her where she is, is not realistic to her chances. But it is realistic for them trying to protect themselves, I suppose. I see here more as an even-money shot, with the quality of that field.”Enable won the King George two years ago but Gosden explained why she faces a stiffer task this time. “She won it as a three-year-old filly, getting the weight from the others, just as Taghrooda won it as a three-year-old filly. It’s a little different when you’re older and suddenly you’ve got a Derby winner coming at you and he’s getting the weight from you. And you have a wonderful old horse, Crystal Ocean, who ran a blinder in it last year and won the Prince of Wales well. So this is no penalty kick, absolutely not.”But he added that everything had gone smoothly for Enable in the three weeks since she made an impressive comeback success in the Eclipse. And he is pleased by Dettori’s continued excellent form.“I suppose, like Lewis Hamilton, you get in the zone and you get your confidence, you’re not frightened of anything. It doesn’t mean that there’s not a banana skin around every corner. But having said that, he is riding well.”Referring to Dettori’s front-running tactics that sealed victory in Saturday’s Irish Oaks on Star Catcher, Gosden said: “He was concerned that they might go forward and then pull the pace up. We discussed it before and I said, ‘You know, with me, you’ve got a blank canvas, you paint the painting any way you want.’ And he went out there and thought, no, I’m not happy with what’s happening here, I’m going to set my own fractions.”I’m trusting that the forecast overnight rain at Ayr has actually turned up and made an impact, as that would be splendid news for Tadaany (2.00), not least because the expected favourite wants fast ground. All three of Tadaany’s turf wins have come on ground with some cut and he was beaten just a head on heavy going last month.I’m encouraged by the booking of Paul Hanagan, who has not ridden him before and is flying along just now. Tadaany is available at 10-1.A winner at Dundalk in April, this chestnut has since dropped to a mark 2lb below the one he had that day, following defeats at Killarney and Naas. Soft ground is an unknown but his pedigree gives hope. He’s 8-1.The nap runs at Windsor tonight. Gallic (7.50) loves fast ground and put up a big effort when beaten by a well-treated rival at Newmarket last month. She comes from the Ed Walker yard that is having one of its best ever months, with 10 winners so far. She’s 9-2 because the market prefers Birdcage Walk, whose recent win was on heavy.Earlier, Junior Rip (5.45) looks big at 13-2 from the Roger Charlton yard that might finally be hitting some form. Leo Minor (7.20) could be overpriced at 9-1 for the sprint series final, having dropped a stone in three months and been unlucky in running last time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6170529807a02fb4593c34e0a3f4b99503e48ff/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5939503d6dcb0e5591863215e30e899d","title":"blue hags and spanish booty the legends of mull","story":"Tales of witches and doomed pipers, plus the promise of hidden treasures beneath the waves, fuel a creative spirit on the Isle of Mull that expresses itself through music, art and whiskyVisitors to the Isle of Mull – Scotland’s fourth-biggest island – are mesmerised by its many treasures. Everyone who lives here – be they artists, musicians or whisky makers – lives in symbiosis with their surroundings, feeding off the folklore embedded in the island’s soul.The story of MacKinnon’s Cave, said to be one of the deepest sea caves in the Hebrides, will chill the heart of many a musician. A piper who was walking his dog in the cave came to a sticky end when a female ogre (or fairy, depending on your folklore source) became unimpressed with his performance. The dog survived, but emerged crazed and hairless with fright. Some claim to have seen the doomed bald canine walking along the top of the caves – and if you’re brave enough to go inside, his harrowing howls can apparently be heard whistling in the wind.Then there’s the ancient Lochbuie stone circle: nine granite rocks that sit silently in their own natural amphitheatre, overlooked by the slopes of Ben Buie. Although most visitors find it a place of tranquility, legend has it that the area is haunted.More chilling still is the tale of idyllic Loch Ba, reputed home to Cailleach Bheur, one of Scotland’s most powerful witches. Once every 100 years, before any other creature had awoken, the blue-faced old hag would submerge herself in the water of the loch, and be transformed into an enchanting beauty. The spell was broken by the bark of a dog who had awoken before she’d finished bathing. The witch, also known as the queen of winter, is said to have created the beautiful rolling hills on the isle by striding across the land and dropping rocks from her basket to form her own stepping stones.The sporadic appearance of valuable artefacts in Tobermory Bay, meanwhile, have convinced many that a sunken Spanish ship from 1588 – either the Florencia or the San Juan de Sicilia – lurks beneath the waves. Having fled the Channel in the wake of the Armada’s defeat, it’s thought to have sunk in the bay, taking its rumoured cargo of £300,000 of gold bullion – which would now fetch more than £30m – with it.There are more riches in the bay than Spanish booty, however. In a town built as a fishing port – that has since developed an acclaimed arts scene, with its own gallery and theatre group – one thing you can count on is fresh seafood the many quaint restaurants and pubs serve crustaceans that go from boat to plate in minutes.You could even be lucky enough to see dolphins, whales and basking sharks just off the shore. Golden and white-tailed eagles have also made this picturesque island their home, as have otters and an abundance of other birds and mammals.The island is also home to the famous Tobermory Distillery, established in 1798. One of Scotland’s oldest distilleries (and the only one on the island), it produces single malts with a captivating charm that are expressive by nature and inspired by the bright, Instagram-perfect buildings that line the waterfront.With its kaleidoscope of colour, culture, wildlife, eerie legends and fine local whisky, Mull could be the place for you to conjure up your own story.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers, visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f237ebad83038a6bad5935f35a776a8028da3c4/0_109_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c109570b99853b96241bb64772302847","title":"send tip off the tourist trail europe twin 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"You might know a hidden-but-wonderful village, town, historic site, landscape or beach.

A half dozen people packed inside but despite the heat, most wore long pants and boots, and several sported black hoodies. The atmosphere was subdued, except for the occasional joke. It wasn’t so much tension as seriousness – there was work to be done.The people in the van are members of the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club (PSJBGC). Their stated aim is to fight white supremacy and build community defense in America’s Pacific Northwest, and their presence has become a fixture of protests in the Seattle and Tacoma areas, where the group is often invited to provide security against rightwing aggression.The night before, several of them had been called to a library in nearby Renton, Washington, where a Drag Story Time Hour, an event series in which a local drag queen or drag king reads to children in a library or bookstore, was being disrupted by rightwing protesters. The protesters, who opposed the event as “immoral”, held up signs equating drag with pedophilia, and screamed “Shame! Shame!” at parents and their kids. Among them were members of the Proud Boys, a violent rightwing street gang, and Three Percenters militia, who were open-carrying firearms. The north-west has been at the center of tense political clashes over the last two years. The area is an adopted home base for far-right groups like Patriot Prayer, Identity EvropaAmerican Identity Movement and the Proud Boys, who have organized numerous marches that have ended in violence. In response, a range of leftist groups have organized self defence groups and, in doing so, present gun ownership as a way to protect themselves and others.Now, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club was en route to Seattle’s Trans Pride March.In the weeks prior, word spread that a number of white supremacist groups had planned to disrupt the celebration. Hearing this, the club reached out to the organizers of the event, the Gender Justice League, and offered to assist with security or to provide escorts.Brooke Wylie, the head of security for the Gender Justice League in charge of overseeing the 101-person security detail for the event, did some research on the club. She told them the event had a policy of having no open carry (that is, no visible weapon), which they were fine with. She accepted their offer. Police were also present, but many marginalized groups do not trust them to provide protection at public events, especially when far-right groups are involved.Each member showed up with a concealed handgun. “We do our actions proportional to the threat, so when other people are out with rifles, we’ll be out with rifles,” Nick, the group’s de facto spokesperson, explained. “In this case, we don’t want to appear threatening for the people that we’re trying to protect and support we want this to be a happy atmosphere, especially for a population that may have faced gun violence on the street just for being who they are.”This scenario – in which armed community groups are working together to patrol a Pride event and protect it from other malicious and potentially armed groups – is becoming more and more common. There are more guns than people in America – approximately 393 million in a country of 328 million people. An average of 34,501 people died each year from firearms in 2018, 992 of those deaths were the result of police shootings.And the memory of the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016, when 49 people were killed at a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida, is still hanging heavily over the LGBTQ community.Throughout the day, Puget Sound members stood watch oversections of the park, staying connected via walkie-talkies. “Thank you for being here!” was a common refrain from march-goers, as were inquiries on how to join (the group has a several-month long vetting process and probationary period for prospective recruits.)Unlike some of the other masked antifascist groups at the march that day, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club considers themselves to be an “aboveground” organization, and chooses not to cover their faces.“Part of the reason we don’t cover our faces is that we don’t want to present as though we are a militia,” Fozz, a longtime member, explained. “We are not. We want to build relationships with people in our community, we want to appear approachable.”While the group has not used deadly force, a former member of the group, Willem Van Spronsen, recently made headlines when he was killed by police after trying to set fire to Ice vehicles in a parking lot outside the Northwest Detention Center In Tacoma, Washington, a private immigration detainment facility.Washington state’s relatively loose gun laws mean that even those with minimal training are able to show up to public events armed, which has potentially lethal implications. At a Milo Yiannopoulos rally at the University of Washington in 2017, an antifascist protester was shot in the stomach by a Trump supporter named Elizabeth Hokoana, who then claimed self-defense if convicted, she faces up to 15 years in prison.This is the context in which an armed community defense group has been invited to protect a trans pride event. The thinking goes that, since there are already guns everywhere, and the people who want to hurt minority groups are often heavily armed, their side may as well have guns, too.When asked about how they would react if a survivor of gun violence came up and confronted them about their decision to bring guns into a public protest space, the Puget Sound Club members say that they would approach the situation with empathy. A member named Seraphiad pointed to their own history with gun violence as a starting point.“The reason some people decide to carry is because they too have been victims of gun violence and other forms of violence,” they explained. “I would relate to them based on my own experience with violence and share my choice to protect myself.”For many other left-leaning organizations, guns remain a difficult topic. The second amendment has attained almost religious significance to some conservative gun owners, while gun control has become a defining issue for centrists and liberals, the opinions of those on the more radical left vary. The Democratic Socialists of America, for example, responded to an interview request for this piece by saying, “the DSA has no comment on gun controls or the second amendments. Our members represent a ersity of viewpoints on this topics.”Others have been more forthcoming. Patrick Blanchfield, the author of a forthcoming book on guns and the left called Gunpower, doesn’t specifically oppose the idea of armed self-defense, but he sees its as a potential danger to both the inidual as well as a broader group or community, referencing the government’s brutal assaults on the Black Panthers as a historical example.Blanchfield also sees an issue in the way armed groups have the potential to inadvertently replicate existing oppressive structures. “You don’t want to be the antifa cop,” he explains. “For example, I would need some convincing that armed leftists didn’t shoot partners at a rate substantially lower than non-leftists.”The Puget Sound chapter is part of a long American leftist tradition of armed groups, from the Black Panthers to current groups like Redneck Revolt, the Socialist Rifle Association, Trigger Warning Queer \u0026amp Trans Gun Club, and the Los Angeles Black Coyote Collective.Twenty one members turned up that day. Nick, Fozz and a member who goes by Reverend were joined by Kat, a diminutive, self-described “soccer mom” quiet, serious Vixen, with strawberry blonde hair and orange knee socks Duke, the group’s stocky, bearded founder and Shannon, a civil rights attorney and constitutional law professor.There are plenty of anarchists among their ranks, but there are also people like Shannon who feel strongly about the second amendment and who are more interested in working within existing frameworks than tearing them down.“There’s power in knowledge of the constitution,” she explains. “It’s okay to be a knowledgeable person whose politics are left of center, and be willing to understand and fight back with the legal framework.”Duke, a lifelong anarchist who founded the Seattle chapter in 2017, describes himself as having retired from activism following the birth of his son in 2012. He did “normal progressive Seattle dad” things like taking his family to Black Lives Matter and Fight for 15 rallies until 2017, when he was inspired to act following the election of Donald Trump – and more specifically, by the proliferation of hate crimes that plagued Seattle during its lead-up.“I really got active in John Brown Gun Club because there were swastikas in my kid’s park,” he says. “I knew a lot of people at that point who were organizing with Redneck Revolt across the country, so I was like, this is something I can do. So I formed this chapter, and members started flocking to us.”The rise of white supremacist violence since 2016 served as a flashpoint for many members’ decisions to arm themselves. Fozz, who is Jewish, told a story about sitting down with his wife after Trump’s election and deciding which of them was going to learn how to use a gun, “because we’re going to need it.”For others, it was the shock of violence at the fatal 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville that sparked their interest in armed self-defense.For Vixen, the decision to join came from the threats right-wing extremism poses to her identity. A trans woman who grew up shooting guns off her front porch in Indiana, she spoke about the toxic culture she had encountered at many gun ranges, and of the obligation she felt to protect her queer community.“Today, I’m a trans woman at Trans Pride, so I feel like I’m personally able to step in front and put myself in front of people who are being attacked or harassed and just try to de-escalate the situation – which is always the goal,” she said. “Obviously, you don’t ever want to celebrate having to use force on someone, but completely throwing it away as an option is really self-defeating.”So far, none of the members have had to use their weapons in this context, and the hope expressed is that they never will.The day after the march, Kat, Nick, Duke, Reverend and Fozz gathered at a coffee shop to debrief. The club views gun control through a specifically leftist political lens. As Duke sees it, the root cause of American violence isn’t the guns themselves it’s inequality.“It comes out of not wanting to arm former slaves and people in poverty who are struggling and organizing, and so when we talk about gun control in America, what we really should be talking about is capital control. If you read the Dred Scott decision, there’s a line in there that says ‘We don’t want to grant citizenship because Black people might get guns,’ and I think that says an awful lot about America and gun control.”White privilege is something that is repeatedly brought up throughout the weekend (while there are people of color in the organization, the membership is majority white). Shannon says that, due to her “middle aged white lady veneer,” she knows she will be treated differently by police when she open carries at a protest.Fozz, a union organizer by trade, has been on suspension for the past four months after his involvement with the PSJBCG during his off hours was made the subject of an investigation at work. His supervisors identified a photo of him open carrying at a protest according to Fozz, the suspension was framed as a workplace safety issue because his bosses believe that he is capable of violence.“It’s very disappointing as well as deeply concerning that an organization like a labor union would actually be critical of someone that takes the time and resources and expenses to stand up to people that would attack its membership,” he says. “I asked them the question, why do you guys have such a problem with a Jew standing up to neo-Nazis that are threatening his neighborhood?”That weekend, none of the Proud Boys or other fascist provocateurs did show up to Trans Pride. For now, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club was off the clock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e3544356208e7072c9edb9833bf0ce0f649904c/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68dce3c08e2315e037aa6806e3e43704","title":"china denies uighurs turkic descent and says hostile forces trying to split country","story":"The government said ‘hostile forces’ wanted to break China apart and called the region of Xinjiang an ‘inseparable’ part of China The far northwestern region of Xinjiang is an “inseparable” part of China despite efforts by extremists to distort history and facts in a bid to split the country, the Chinese government said in a document published late on Sunday.The government said in a white paper published by the State Council Information Office it was wrong to suggest members of Xinjiang’s minority Uighur Muslim community were descended from Turks, noting they had become the political tool of pan-Turkic and pan-Islamic groups.The paper said “hostile forces in and outside China, especially separatists, religious extremists and terrorists, have tried to split China and break it apart by distorting history and facts”.Beijing has been accused of persecuting Uighurs, with at least a million believed to be detained in what China insists are vocational centres aimed at reducing the spread of Islamist extremism.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo branded China’s treatment of its Uighur minority the “stain of the century” on Thursday.The government white paper said Xinjiang has been a part of China since the Han dynasty in the third century and its people and ethnic cultures were formed by a long process of migration and integration.It also said Islam was not the indigenous or sole belief system of the Uighurs but was imposed by the expansion of the Arab Empire, and that “theocracy” and “religious supremacism” were a betrayal that needed to be opposed.“Hostile foreign forces and separatist, religious extremist and terrorist forces that have colluded to distort history ... will be cast aside by history and the people,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06e0624fa03df3c9c1c4190f787c3b8f72d14d0c/0_161_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fbbed5d26a07c187c8ec6b3812a4c86","title":"goo look lovely thai farmers milk snails to cash in on beauty craze","story":"Industry has boomed in Thailand, with more than 80 snail farms in one province alone feeding cosmetics demand For years, they were the unwelcome slimy plague on the farmers of Thailand. But a global cosmetic demand for snail secretions, thought to offset ageing and give the skin a dewy glow, has led to a growing new business for snail farms, where the molluscs are “milked” for their slime, known as mucin.Over the past three years, Thai farmers and opportunistic locals have begun keeping the creatures they once desperately tried to rid themselves of, as snail slime has become worth more than gold and the global slime industry has boomed to be worth an estimated $314m.There are now more than 80 snail farms in the Thai province of Nakhon Nayok, two hours east of Bangkok.Phatinisiri Thangkeaw, a teacher, said she had begun her business by purchasing snails from the nearby rice farmers, who were glad to be rid of the creatures who desecrated their newly planted crops. She pays local farmers around $1 for a kilogram of snails and now has more than 1,000 snails that she milks for their mucin and then sells.“Farmers used to throw them on the road or in the rivers,” said Phatinisiri. “But now they sell them to me to earn extra money.”The process of harvesting the slime is seen as humane, involving dripping water over the snails to encourage them to secrete the mucin, which does not kill or harm them. To keep the quality high, in Thailand the snails are fed vegetables and grains and are only milked once every three weeks.In Thailand, the raw mucin is sold to a single cosmetics company, Aden International, which was established after Kitpong Puttarathuvanun saw a gap in the market. He sells the slime both as an expensive serum and a dried powder.It was in the 1980s that the potential of snail secretions were noticed by breeders in Chile, who marvelled at how soft their hands became after handling the molluscs. The first cream containing snail mucin was produced in Chile, but in recent years it has boomed as an ingredient in Korean and American beauty products, and snail mucin face masks can cost upwards of $300.Their mucin contains ingredients like glycoproteins, hyaluronic acid, and glycolic acid, and the snail creams and serums are sold with the promise of stimulating collagen, slowing the onset of wrinkles and healing acne and reducing scar tissue, though dermatologists are ided on the benefits.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4838b130d61913c01544f27ac42aa4dac04f7690/0_1_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef1054014ece5d83e11addec95a2da48","title":"indias chandrayaan 2 moon mission lifts off a week after aborted launch","story":"With first mission to land on lunar south pole, India aims to join club comprising Russia, the US and ChinaIndia’s mission to the moon has blasted into space one week after a technical glitch forced scientists to abruptly halt its scheduled launch.Thousands gathered to watch Chandrayaan-2 takeoff at 2.43pm local time (0913 GMT) on Monday from Satish Dhawan space centre in Sriharikota, north of Chennai. Last Monday, the unmanned mission was aborted 56 minutes from takeoff. The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) blamed a “technical snag”.In a speech after the launch, Kailasavaoo Sivan, chairman of Isro, said the agency’s staff had worked tirelessly to fix the fault and had “bounced back with flying colours”.“It is the beginning of a historical journey of India towards the moon, and to land at a place near the south pole to carry out scientific experiments to explore the unexplored,” said Sivan.Chandrayaan-2 aims to become the first mission to conduct a surface landing on the lunar south pole region, where it will collect crucial information about the moon’s composition. It would be India’s first surface landing on the moon – a feat previously achieved by only Russia, the US and China.The $141m (£113m) mission is a “demonstration of the growing sophistication of India’s space power,” said Dr Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, head of the nuclear and space policy initiative at the Observer Research Foundation thinktank in Delhi.India launched its first lunar probe in 2008, and guided a spacecraft into orbit around Mars in 2014.In March, Modi, announced the country had successfully shot down one of its own satellites with a missile. Though celebrated by Modi as breakthrough for India’s national security, the missile test was criticised by Nasa for creating hundreds of pieces of orbital debris and threatening astronauts onboard the International Space Station (ISS).The launch of Chandrayaan-2 follows the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, and comes amid renewed interest in returning to the moon among states and private industry. In January China landed the Chang’e 4 spacecraft on the previously unexplored far side of the moon, while in April the Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, the first privately funded mission to the moon, crashed after an apparent engine failure. Donald Trump has also said he wants to put astronauts back on the moon by 2024.Chandrayaan-2, whose name is Sanskrit for “moon craft”, is India’s most ambitious space mission yet. Its first lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1, helped confirm the presence of water on the moon, but did so without landing on the lunar surface. Kailasavaoo Sivan, chairman of Isro, said carrying out a soft landing will be “15 terrifying minutes”.At the forefront of the Chandrayaan-2 mission are two women. It’s project director Muthayya Vanitha, an electronics system engineer, was named by science journal Nature as one of five scientists to watch in 2019. It is also being navigated by Ritu Karidhal, who helped lead India’s Mars mission in 2014.The four-tonne spacecraft has a lunar orbiter, a lander and a rover that will be deployed in early September. The rover, named Pragyan which means “wisdom” in Sanskrit, will spend two weeks traversing the moon’s surface. The six-wheeled vehicle will collect crucial information about the mineral and chemical composition of the lunar surface, and search for water.As well as Chandrayaan-2, India has said it aims to send three astronauts into space by 2022."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11da9e3b2c2d8400e8e0ce33d1b69d67cfe2411c/0_186_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7c980df82d9a203fdc71d3d033d6a8a","title":"six months on juan guaido supporters hang on to fading hope in venezuela","story":"Fresh protests to mark half a year after he declared himself interim leader, but Nicolás Maduro remains in powerSol Castro Sánchez was a picture of elation as she took to the streets of Caracas in the days after Juan Guaidó launched his dramatic bid to topple Nicolás Maduro on 23 January.“I guess this is what people in Germany felt in 1989 when the wall came down,” the retired professor enthused as she marched through Venezuela’s capital with tens of thousands of jubilant protesters and a homemade placard that read: “Enough is enough! We want them out!”Six months later, that excitement – and with it Castro’s conviction that change is nigh – is fading.“At that time, I felt you could reach out and you could grasp it,” the 63-year-old caraqueña admitted this week. “I don’t have that feeling any more.”When Guaidó declared himself Venezuela’s rightful interim leader on 23 January – and was recognised by dozens of foreign governments, including Britain and the US – the young opposition leader and his backers believed Maduro would fall within days.But half a year later, a massive show of domestic dissent and international pressure has failed to dislodge Hugo Chávez’s unpopular successor.“This was a very high stakes gamble … and it hasn’t really paid off,” said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based expert for Crisis Group and author of a  report on possible solutions to Venezuela’s crisis. “Plan A has certainly not worked.”That reality has forced Venezuela’s opposition to begin exploring alternatives, particularly after a botched bid to spark a military uprising on 30 April.This month, Guaidó and Maduro representatives met on the Caribbean island of Barbados for the latest round of talks optimists hope could lead to free presidential elections in 2020, but which pessimists dismiss as a stalling tactic from Venezuela’s wily authoritarian leader.Guaidó, meanwhile, has busied himself touring his crisis-stricken country – he has visited 13 of Venezuela’s 23 states since January – in an effort to keep his campaign alive.“We are getting close to a real solution,” he claimed last week.Some have already given up on the 35-year-old politician, amid reports that even Donald Trump – Guaidó’s key backer – is losing interest in his crusade.The commitment of another crucial regional supporter, Jair Bolsonaro, is also in doubt, after Brazil’s far-right president recently dropped a mention of Guaidó from a speech for fear of upsetting Russia’s Vladimir Putin who, along with China’s Xi Jinping, continues to support Maduro. (On Friday, Bolsonaro said he hoped Russia would “help resolve the Venezuela question”.)Rengifo – who lives in a hotel near the border town of Cúcuta with hundreds of other stranded defectors – said it was time to up the ante. He hoped a more radical leader, María Corina Machado, could take the lead in toppling Maduro.“Guaidó can keep calling protests but people have stopped caring,” he said.Valentina Landaeta, a 23-year-old businesswoman who joined pro-Guaidó protests at the start of the year, said she had also lost faith. “Probably we are not going to have change,” she conceded. “It’s a little sad. We put our hopes in him.”In February, Landaeta recalled feeling sure Venezuela was entering a new era. “We were wrong,” she said.But Castro, who has continued to attend Guaidó’s dwindling demonstrations, rejected such pessimism and said she still saw him as the only person capable of defeating Maduro. “It has to be Guaidó,” she said.Of Guaidó’s doubters, Castro complained: “We love heroes. But once they are defeated, or perceived as defeated, we throw them in the trash. It happened to Henrique Capriles. It happened to Leopoldo López,” she said of two other prominent opposition leaders who have tried – and failed – to defeat chavismo. “And I feel it has happened with Guaidó.”Juan Andrés Mejía, a close Guaidó ally, said he understood public frustration and accepted there was “always a risk” the international community would be distracted by crises such as Iran.“Obviously people are anxious, people are desperate … But it is wrong to say that all is lost,” Mejía insisted, claiming “huge progress” since January.“We all wanted this to end sooner. But we are dealing with a dictatorship that kills, that tortures, that robs,” added Mejía, forced underground by a crackdown on opposition politicians supposedly involved in April’s failed insurrection. “Defeating such an opponent is much harder to do than most people may believe.”Gunson agreed there were things for Guaidó’s camp to celebrate even though January’s “fervour” had fizzled.Guaidó – who will mark the six-month anniversary of his challenge on Tuesday with fresh protests – has retained widespread support. Venezuela’s notoriously fractious opposition has yet to fall apart, despite constant “sniping from the wings” from more hardline rivals.Maduro remains in power but is weakened – to the extent that it was conceivable the military might “elbow him aside” and replace him with a junta, Gunson said.But if talks come to nothing, Venezuela’s economic and humanitarian catastrophe would worsen and the future would be bleak. “There is a real danger this could escalate into some kind of long-term low-intensity armed conflict within Venezuela,” Gunson warned.As her long wait for a brighter future drags on, Castro said she sought solace in the past. “History tells you that this is not going to last forever. It is not going to last 100 years,” she insisted. “I know it’s going to end – sooner or later it will.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Owner of miniature chihuahua Gizmo issues appeal after seeing him carried away by gullCommon toad named Trevor becomes face of herpetological society campaignThree others taken to hospital following Sunday night crash in OmaghOwner expresses relief after he captures marsupial near Kilworth villageBrief warm spell could see highs of up to 28 degrees in some areas, says Met \u0026EacuteireannBar Council calls for \u0026lsquorape myths\u0026rsquo to be combated in its submission to review bodyFarmer Thomas McKeown says campaign will be a much-needed shot in the arm for the industryManagement at service provider for people with disabilities told HSE of \u0026lsquolegacy\u0026rsquo practicesBord Bia study reveals millennials buy potatoes \u0026lsquofar less\u0026rsquo than rest of the populationEvolution of soft drinks and their sweetening content may explain shortfall in tax yieldTipperary council seeks removal of unofficial site as condition of deal to house six familiesAn audit will value memorabilia relating to Beckett, Swift, Bram Stoker and many othersDublin City Council has lodged planning application for two southside sitesCockroaches were found in \u0026lsquoclothes and food\u0026rsquo, according to one complainantBuilding will be in a compound in Abuja with embassies from other EU countriesFor a mother of young children, not being able to take them anywhere is \u0026lsquodraining\u0026rsquoCharity highlights burden of keeping children occupied in straitened circumstancesGovernment moves to introduce minimum employment standards for sectorHiqa warns of \u0026lsquoimpending risk\u0026rsquo of multiple closures due to unsuitable premises"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3963242.1563735597!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nearly 50 000 children waiting to see a paediatrician","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMore than 19,000  children in Ireland were waiting longer than 12 months to see a specialist. Photograph: iStockThere are nearly 50,000 children waiting to see a paediatrician for an outpatient appointment, hospital consultants have said.The Irish Hospital Consultants Association (IHCA) said on Sunday that a shortage of consultant paediatricians across all paediatric specialities was restricting children from accessing high-quality medical care.“This is also contributing massively to growing waiting times where we have seen an increase of 14,965 in the last 36 months, more than a 46 per cent increase in the number of children waiting to see a paediatrician for an outpatient appointment .”It said more than 19,000 children were waiting longer than 12 months to see a specialist.Professor of paediatrics at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and consultant paediatrician at Temple Street Children’s Hospital Dr Alf Nicholson said: “It is very unacceptable to have a waiting time of anything other than three to six months, at most, for a young child or infant to see a specialist. Sadly, at the moment our wait times are well above that, and that is very distressing to be a part of.”He said “the effects that long waiting lists have on patients is significant”.“It is solvable if we bring in new specialists. Specialists that should already be a part the health service system”.It said that collectively there were:– 7,988 children are waiting to see a paediatric ENT specialist– 5,165 children are waiting to see a paediatric cardiologist– 3,735 children are waiting to see a paediatric orthopaedic specialist and– 1,989 children are waiting to see a paediatric surgeon.The IHCA argued that the growing waiting lists were restricting the access of children “to the timely medical care they deserve”.The IHCA said overall the consultant recruitment crisis was having a detrimental affect on the Irish public health service system in terms of waiting times, timely treatment and patient safety. It said that one in every five permanent consultant posts in the country’s public health service were either unfilled or filled by temporary appointments.On Saturday The  reported that the new children’s urgent care centre to be opened at Connolly Hospital next week will only be operational from 8am to 6pm Monday to Friday due to a shortage of medical consultants.The new centre is essentially the first element of the new national children’s hospital project.CHI said on Friday night that the new centre would open on a phased basis from July 31st because of “temporary vacancies in consultant posts”.“There are recruitment challenges nationally and internationally in certain specialities such as paediatric radiology and paediatric emergency medicine,” CHI said in a statement."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3961695.1563564498!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what sort of boris can ireland expect","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson: For a politician about to reach the high office –  nobody appears to trust a word he says. Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergSenior figures in the Irish Government no longer wonder about whether they will be faced with Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt as the next British prime minister. Barring a political earthquake of monumental proportions, they accept that it will be Johnson.However, they do wonder about which Johnson they will get. Irish diplomats have combed through his speeches and articles. They have gathered information, views, opinions and the countless perspectives on him that exist.The Irish Embassy in London has an exceptionally wide and effective network for taking soundings throughout the political and media world in Westminster and beyond, and they have been funnelling reports back to Dublin. Still, the view in Dublin is: we’ll wait and see what he says. The subtext: we have no idea what he’ll do. The wait-and-see stance rests upon a remarkable fact that for a politician about to reach the high office in his land: nobody appears to trust a word he says.Perhaps that’s not surprising. He has promised, repeatedly, to take the UK out of the EU by October 31st, “do-or-die”, with or without a deal. Though he has also said that once the EU sees that the UK is serious about leaving with no deal, it will consent to changes to the backstop, which would enable an orderly Brexit to happen on the agreed October date.Another Irish official puts it slightly differently: are we going to get mayor of London Boris, or foreign secretary Boris?In the mayor’s office, Johnson had strong deputies and gave them the powers to do the work he wanted done. As foreign secretary, he was disorganised, directionless, ineffectual (he eventually resigned from the cabinet over Theresa May’s Brexit policy, having repeatedly endorsed it). Even Johnson’s supporters seldom refer to his time as the UK’s diplomatic and foreign policy supremo. Throughout the campaign for the leadership, he has hardly mentioned it.Warning light here: being prime minister is an infinitely more difficult job than being either mayor of London or foreign secretary. And the stakes – for Ireland and the UK – are a lot higher. The decisions Johnson makes in the coming weeks and months will have a direct bearing on the lives of people throughout Britain and Ireland for decades to come.Brexiteer blusterIn Dublin, Ministers and officials say they are conscious of the need not to let Brexit dominate the business of government to the exclusion of all else, in the way that it has done in the UK.And yet they confess that nothing approaches the issue in importance. That will become clear once Johnson becomes prime minister and the recent otiose phase of Theresa May’s lame-duck period gives way to three months of deal-or-no-deal decision time.Dublin half-expects a visit from Johnson soon after he becomes prime minister, possibly even next week. Then there will be no extended August break for senior politicians and officials: they’ll all be back at their desks by the middle of the month, trying to figure out: which Boris?Patrick Maguire, political correspondent with the New Statesman magazine in London, says that Boris will want to be both Borises – the brash Brexiteer in order to get a new deal from Brussels, and the pragmatic centrist who can govern, and win an election, as a one-Nation Tory.Blair Horan, a retired trade union chief who researches and writes on Brexit issues for the Institute of International and European Affairs think tank, sees this possibility, too, and worries it will end up stumbling into a no-deal.If this is the Johnson plan it hinges on one very questionable assumption: that Brussels and Dublin will be sufficiently impressedintimidated by Brexiteer bluster that they will consent to a change in the backstop arrangements contained in the withdrawal agreement.That might turn out to be the case. But at present there is little evidence that it will. And there is a lot of evidence that it will not. For a start, there is a series of frequent and repeated statements from Irish and EU leaders. There is the fact that it is clearly against the EU’s interests to do so. And there is the fact, attested to by Irish and EU sources, that many people in Dublin and Brussels believe that (a) Johnson is bluffing about a no-deal and (b) even if he isn’t bluffing, parliament will stop him.Their belief in the latter – prompted by contacts with British ministers – has been bolstered by the result of Thursday’s vote in the House of Commons, which seeks to block the suspension of parliament. Even though it is not clear that parliament can effectively prevent a no-deal outcome, it is certainly clear that it will try. Having already endured the fiasco of dealing with a prime minister who could not control her parliament, this will not encourage the EU to negotiate with Johnson.‘Spoilt child’Some sources in Dublin, London and Brussels say that Johnson’s only hope of progress is to approach the EU with a realistic proposal and a conciliatory mood. The EU is not going to tear up the backstop and Johnson knows that. But a change, centring mostly on the political declaration (which charts the direction for the future trade deal) but perhaps involving tweaks to the backstop, might be a different matter. It would at least be more difficult to reject. On Thursday, the Taoiseach suggested that the backstop could be changed from an arrangement which covers the whole of the UK, to one which just related to Northern Ireland. This would, after all, mean reopening the withdrawal agreement. But it is far from clear that Johnson has either the desire or political capacity for such a nuanced approach.And whatever he says about Dublin, Johnson will be dealing not just with Leo Varadkar but with the EU, whose remarkable cohesion on the question shows no sign of slipping.And in Brussels, they think he is simply a liar and a charlatan. Having been subjected to Johnson’s malicious and frequently mendacious journalism, and having watched his championing of Brexit with growing horror, the EU is disinclined to give Johnson the benefit of the doubt.A “spoilt child of a man, who lies like a toddler and has only the vaguest of political convictions” was the description a former EU spokesman, Jean Quatremer. And yet, Quatremer reflected, “a pragmatic buffoon might be better than a fanatic”.“Many in Brussels believe he is capable of any move, even backtracking and shelving Brexit if he thinks it could be turned to his personal advantage,” he wrote.It is this personal and political unpredictability that make the forthcoming Johnson premiership, its Brexit policy and its ultimate direction so uncertain. Everyone will wait and see. But the range of possible outcomes is dizzyingly wide.“I doubt if he is sitting around talking to serious people,” says McDonagh. “My sense is that he acts instinctively . . . He will smell the air and decide where political advantage lies.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

They are often the family matriarchs being left with significant wealth.The ’s Women Mean Business campaign has fought to get better access to funding for female founders, who typically receive less than 10 per cent of start-up funding in this country. According to the UK\u0027s biggest ever study into the female experience of wealth, nearly a quarter of women (23 per cent) see wealth as a symbol of freedom and independence.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It carried Gizmo a fair way as we couldn\u0027t see him anymore. I have no idea if he was dropped or where he is now, Ms Hill told the Devon Live website.She also posted about Gizmo on Facebook. Please, please, please, anyone finds a chihuahua he\u0027s mine, a seagull took him from my garden, she wrote.Ms Hill said her six-year-old daughter is really upset and missing her dog.Fortunately, the child did not witness Gizmo being taken away.Peter Rock, an ornithologist at the University of Bristol and seagull expert has warned owners of tiny dogs to not let them run around in the garden unattended.He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: These gulls are very large and as you know, if you\u0027ve been around gulls, you\u0027ll know they\u0027re very large and are quite capable of picking up small animals, quite commonly they will kill pigeons that look a little bit under the weather.It brings me back to that story a long time ago about poor little Roo in Cornwall who got attacked by herring gulls.He said that he has seen gulls rip the innards out of fully-grown mallards, and that small dogs could be at risk.Mr Rock added:  If you have a very tiny little dog I suggest you don\u0027t let it run around on your garden as it might well become a meal. It would have to be very tiny like this one was.There are several recorded incidents of seagulls attacking small dogs. The problem seems particularly rife in Devon in May 2015 Niki Wayne, 57, who lives nearby watched in shock as her chihuahua was pecked to death by ruthless gulls. As her owner took a shower, Bella managed to nudge open a slightly ajar door and run outside, where she was killed by gulls. An RSPB spokesman said: This must be extremely upsetting for the dog\u0027s owner. Fortunately these types of incidents are very rare and not typical gull behaviour.It is not currently legal to shoot a gull which is threatening or harming a pet. Those who feel they have a case can apply to Natural England for a licence, but it takes around 30 days for a licence to be issued if the application is approved.Some have called for pest birds to be killed if they are causing nuisance or hurting a family pet.Tim Bonner, Chief Executive of the Countryside Alliance said “All humane options need to remain on the table when it comes to wildlife management especially when there are cases such as this that show a direct conflict with humans. “The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The aerobatic display team have been granted formal approval on Wednesday to perform for audiences, known as Public Display Authority (PDA), to mark the official start of the Red Arrows\u0027 55th display seasonThe survey, of more than 4,000 staff in schools and further education providers, found teachers spend most of their week on non-teaching tasks – including communication with parents.Teachers are under huge pressure to respond immediately to “incessant” emails from parents who expect an instant reply, according to the report.Restricting access to staff email addresses and reminding parents of the most appropriate ways of raising concerns, such as face-to-face meetings or phone calls, could be a solution, Ofsted suggests.Ms Spielman has called for an end to what she described as an “instant response culture”.One teacher, responding to the survey on wellbeing, described their email inbox as “like a pit of death”, while another said parents email at night and expect an immediate reply. If you do not reply, the parent will call the head\u0026nbspfirst thing in the morning, they said.‘Aggressive’ parents demand teachers email and message them 247Going straight to the head when a complaint is not immediately answered is part of a rising culture in society of “wanting to complain at the highest level”, the report says. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe findings\u0026nbspcome after\u0026nbspa survey from the\u0026nbspNASUWT\u0026nbspteaching union in April revealed that\u0026nbsp“unbearable” communication from parents\u0026nbsphad led to\u0026nbspstaff considering quitting.The growing use of apps by schools is making it easier for parents to contact teachers directly 247, adding to their\u0026nbspworkload\u0026nbspand affecting their health, the union said.\u0026nbspSome teachers also have “unrealistic” expectations placed on them by parents who want “the highest grades for their children despite their lack of effort”, the Ofsted report says.Ms Spielman said: “Schools have to play their part to improve their staff’s wellbeing and manage the expectation of parents.“It’s high time leaders took steps to end this ‘instant response culture’, that is putting huge pressure on teachers, and allow them to focus on the important work of teaching.”‘Bullying’ Ofsted ‘too test-obsessed to understand Steiner schools’Ofsted: Intimidation of teachers over LGBT+ lessons is ‘unacceptable’Parents must be responsible for protecting children from knife crimeMore than two in three (68 per cent) of teachers feel their profession is undervalued in society – and many blame a lack of funding.Staff say a lack of resources, such as computers and library materials, stops them from doing their job as well as they can.Some teachers describe the facilities as “laughably poor” and they say classrooms are so small or badly equipped that they cannot provide a “good service to students”.Nearly half (46 per cent) of school staff reported low and medium levels of satisfaction with life, compared to just 18 per cent of the general population in EnglandMs Spielman added: “Teaching is one of the most important jobs there is, so we need to make sure it is highly valued by society and a rewarding career to choose.“As the school year comes to a close, I hope parents really appreciate all the long hours and hard work that teachers have put in for their child.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We know that poor behaviour damages teachers’ morale and increases workload and stress, which is why we want schools to instil cultures of good behaviour from top to bottom.“Where staff are struggling, we trust headteachers to take action to address the causes and ensure teachers have the support they need.“We are also tackling excessive data burdens in schools simplifying the accountability system to target the associated burdens and working with Ofsted to ensure staff workload is considered as part of a school’s inspection judgement.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Certainly with an\u0026nbspuncrewed\u0026nbspvehicle I believe we could land on the moon in two years,” he told Time.\u0026nbsp“If it were to take longer to convince Nasa and the authorities that we can do it versus just doing it, then we might just do it. It may literally be easier to just land Starship on the moon than try to convince Nasa that we can.“The sheer amount of effort required to convince a large number of skeptical engineers at Nasa that we can do it is very high...

If it were on the moon it would simply droop. The truth is that it is not waving, rather it is being held in place by a telescopic pole running through the top of the flag and it is crumpled as it had been screwed up for days en route to the moon28 Boot doesn\u0027t match the boot printIt is suggested that this picture of a boot print on the moon is fake because it does not line up with the tread of this boot from Neil Armstrong’s spacesuit. That’s right, it doesn’t38 Boot doesn’t match the boot printThe print does however match that of the outer boots, the ones worn by the Apollo crew when walking on the moon. And while we’re at it: the print is from Buzz Aldrin, not Armstrong.48 No stars in outer space?Why are there no stars in sight when this picture was taken on a rock in outer space that has no atmosphere? Answer: camera settings. In order to capture this photo in direct sunlight, the camera would have to have a very narrow aperture and the shutter would only stay open for a minuscule amount of time. This means that the camera will not take in the light of the distant stars, only that of the much nearer, brighter sun.58 Astronauts couldn’t survive the radiation beltsThe Van Allen belts are regions of extremely high energy charged particles are trapped in the earth’s magnetic field.

If you’ve ever done firewalking, you’ll know the one thing you don’t do is linger around in the middle of the firepit.

You’re absolutely fine.

And you’d have this incredible shot of green plants against a red background,” he said.SpaceX could land on the moon by 2021, Elon Musk claims (SpaceX)“My goal was simply to get the public excited, which would then get Congress excited so that they would appropriate more money and increase Nasa’s budget.”With the increasing success of SpaceX, Mr Musk has since extended his ambitions for the firm. He believes that with innovations like reusable rockets, SpaceX can help humanity eventually become a multi-planet\u0026nbspspecies, with the eventual goal of saving our species from extinction.The SpaceX\u0026nbspand Tesla boss is known for his overly-ambitious timelines, though has also made a habit of eventually delivering on promises.Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspown estimates for returning to the moon are also ambitious, though slightly more conservative.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway.

A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time.

These gentle prey animals are easily stressed and would have been terrified of the loud music and rowdy, drunk festivalgoers.”The Health and Safety Executive advises that sheep should never be dyed for cosmetic purposes, she said.Other social media users also condemned the advertising technique.Some pledged to boycott Latitude, near Southwold in Suffolk, and many said they were protesting to the organisers.Zoos ‘starve birds of prey to make them perform circus-style tricks’Zoo ‘parties’ with alcohol prompt worries animals will be ‘terrified’Zoo euthanises flamingo after child throws rock at itPetting zoos ‘a breeding ground for drug-resistant superbugs’Andrew Kelly, head of the Irish Society for the Protection of Animals, said “Why do people feel the need to do this kind of thing? What does it add to the festival exactly other than to display an odd attitude to animals?”Others went further, saying the festival should be ashamed or should be prosecuted.“Using animals is one thing. Using them as a gimmick is another. Using them around such an unhealthy and unnatural environment such as your event, showed your stupidity. Your PR should be fired,” tweeted Paul Tully, a tourism marketing manager.Latitude, which was best family festival at last year’s UK Festival awards, defended the stunt, saying the animals had been “dip-dyed using natural, water-based dye which they are used to as part of their normal farm life for insecticides and parasites like itch-mite, blow-flies, ticks and lice”.It was a water-based dye which the sheep\u0026nbspare used to as part of their normal farm lifeBut the RSPCA said it was also expressing its concerns to the festival organisers, adding the sight was “very sad to see” but that it was not illegal.It’s not the first time sheep have been dyed to publicise the event.East Suffolk council said on behalf of Latitude that it had “no concerns about the sheep this year or in the 14 years that this activity has taken place”.“We are entirely happy that the water-based dye is completely safe and that the festival organisers have taken all appropriate steps to ensure the animals are content, safe and well looked after,” the council added.It said if it had felt that the sheep were suffering distress of any kind it would not permit them to be dyed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I caught the illness because I was looking after him. I started vomiting and had a headache and flu. I felt so sorry for myself. But I went to the hospital in time to be cured.”“I was really sad because he was the only son I had. Sometimes when I remember everything that has happened, I start burning.

She also explained Ebola survivors, such as herself, face a great deal of stigma within the community.\u0026nbsp“People are somehow afraid when they look at Ebola victims even though they are survivors, she added.\u0026nbspThey believe I can contaminate other people but I can\u0027t. People talk a lot. It is a close-knit community. Especially when they take someone from their home to be an Ebola Treatment Centre for three\u0026nbspweeks. People know where you have gone.”The World Health Organisation declared the Ebola epidemic in the DRC a public health emergency on Wednesday – with the director general appealing for the international community to help with funds.\u0026nbspDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the World Health Organisation was working on a new plan to control the epidemic which would cost “hundred of millions” of dollars.Global emergency declared over Ebola after deadly outbreak in centralKellie Ryan, a spokesperson for the International Rescue Committee’s Ebola Response, estimated the latest death toll for Ebola in the DRC\u0026nbspto be 1,698. She said around 12 new cases are reported every day and there have been 2,522 confirmed and probable cases.She argued women in the country were bearing the brunt of the crisis – with women more likely to get the illness than men due to women being the “primary caretakers” of children, the sick and the elderly, which exposes them more to the virus.\u0026nbspMs Ryan added: “Gender inequality does have something to do with this. More than 60 per cent of confirmed and probable cases are women. Additionally, because women take care of the home, they have to go out to fetch water more often to keep up with more frequent hand washing practices and rigorous cleaning. This makes them vulnerable to gender-based violence as they travelling by themselves more frequently.“Survivors of Ebola face stigmatization by members of their community and sometimes even their families. Neighbours might think they are still contagious and will not want to engage with them or let their children play with their children. A woman’s husband might think she can still pass on the disease. The IRC provides survivors with psychosocial support to help them handle these feelings of isolation.”She said the fragile security situation makes it harder for herself, her colleagues and others responding to Ebola to do their jobs.\u0026nbspWhat is Ebola and what is the risk to travellers?“Due to attacks by armed groups, we are sometimes forced to suspend programming to ensure the safety and security of our staff,” she added. “Ebola is a very complicated disease, and the outbreak is happening in an area and to communities that have faced decades of violence by armed groups. It is easy to understand why the local community distrusts the response. Ebola is a new disease to them, and they can’t understand why a year on, cases continue to rise. There are rumours that health workers are profiting off the outbreak or even brought Ebola to the area themselves.”Since January, there have been 198 attacks against the health response that have led to seven deaths and left 58 healthcare workers and patients injured. Clinics and treatment centres have been torched.The current outbreak in the eastern part of the DRC started back in 2018 and is the tenth to hit the country since 1976 when the virus was first discovered. It is the second biggest Ebola outbreak, after the west Africa epidemic which saw 28,616 cases of disease and 11,310 deaths reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2014 and 2016.The crisis has come to a critical point since the first case of Ebola in the eastern city of Goma was confirmed earlier in the week. The city of two million people is a major transport hub on the border with Rwanda – with transport links to the broader region.Health officials confirm first Ebola case in DRC city of GomaKaswera Flourine, a 45-year-old, had six children but two died. While one died from malaria, another died from Ebola. Ms Flourine was among one of the first people to get Ebola from Mangina – a city in North Kivu province. \u0026nbsp“I went to hospital because I had malaria but then the nurses contaminated me with Ebola while looking after me, she said.\u0026nbspI was afraid because I noticed lots of people were dying from Ebola. I knew it was rare to recover. I was in a coma for three weeks. When I woke up from the coma, I was still sick. Other people thought I had died, I had come out to talk to people to show I was alive.”Kavira Desange, who is 57, had eight children but now has just six due to one dying of poison at the age of seven and the other dying of a stomach ache and different diseases.Ms Desange contracted Ebola while looking after her daughter-in-law who died after getting Ebola.\u0026nbsp“After three days, she passed away,” she said. “My daughter-in-law had a baby but she was not contaminated because she refused to take care of the baby. After finishing the burial ceremony, I returned to Beni to go home but the symptoms started. I began to have a cold, a cough, and get influenza. After some days I\u0026nbspstarted having diarrhoea.”She went to the hospital where they tried to place her in an Ebola Treatment Centre but she ended up going home because she was scared.

The region’s 100,000 residents are incentivised to drop off unwanted items which they would otherwise throw out (or sell online), and then stop to\u0026nbspbrowse their neighbours’ equivalent contributions.“You see people bringing in a dining room table or old computer, then walking out an hour later with a good-as-new bike or a camcorder from the Eighties,” says Anna. “Which is just what we want.“The aim is to make this a unique shopping experience so people don’t just come here because, ethically, it’s the right thing to do, but because they want to because they know they’ll find wonderful things in a beautiful building so, what we do here\u0026nbspis show that a town can reduce its waste without sacrificing its love of retail therapy. These two things can co-exist.”Now, as ReTuna approaches its fifth year, it seems the world is paying attention.World leaders defy Trump’s demand to water down G20 climate commitmentMounds of rotting seaweed spoil pristine beaches in Mexico Anger as May says holidays inspired her to ‘lead’ on climate changeEurope is cooking. Our attempts to outrun climate change are futileA centre modelled on it is to open in Hamar in Norway early next year, while local authorities from Germany, Japan and Switzerland have all sent representatives here over the last 18 months to consider the viability of doing something similar.Significantly, what Anna calls “a handful” of businesses, entrepreneurs and charity officials, though no councils, have also been in touch from the UK, apparently with a view to opening such a centre here.“I cannot say more, because these things are confidential,” she says. “But I am sure this will happen in Britain within two or three years. I think people are beginning to understand it is important: if you are not sustainable in the future – I mean either as a community or business – you will not survive.”ReTuna, it is worth making clear, remains a relatively small-scale experiment.There are just 12 shops\u0026nbsphere, while visitor numbers have stayed stubbornly plateaued at about 255,000 a year since it first opened in August 2015. Total sales are good – some £2.8m worth of goods have been bought since day one – but still fall slightly short of what was hoped for. A plan to expand the centre to more than 5,000 square metres remains on hold until those figures pick up.“It’s a difficult retail environment competing against the convenience of online, and we feel that as much as any other mall,” says Anna.All the same, visiting ReTuna is undoubtedly an experience.Set opposite a nature reserve in a repurposed DHL building 10 minutes from Eskilstuna’s town centre, its high sliding doors reveal an inside that is all glass, polished concrete and exposed industrial piping. An art installation\u0026nbspand communal seating (all made of repurposed materials, of course) welcome visitors, while a glass roof and mezzanine upper floor mean\u0026nbspnatural light floods through the mall. Perfume fills the air. The café does a mean baked potato with salad.“People in Sweden love the idea of sustainability, but they sometimes associate second-hand shopping with flea markets,” says Anna, who has more than 15 years’ experience managing shopping centres. “We wanted to get as far from that image as possible. This is about making pre-loved high-end and desirable.”She mentions the Mall of Scandinavia, a 171-store, 42-restaurant megaplex, which opened an hour away in Stockholm just three months after ReTuna.“But I think we’re the real Mall of Scandinavia,” the mother-of-four says. “That’s just a big version of any other shopping centre in the world. This is an attempt to show the world a new way.”Spenders here today, it seems, agree.One I speak to, Drew Nissen, is an American tourist who has popped in while visiting family in the area.“It’s an incredible place,” the 33-year-old photographer from Atlanta says. “It’s all so visually enticing. It makes you want to spend money. I’d love to see something like it in the States. Second-hand shops there are so depressing. Change that image, emphasise the green credentials, and I think you have a success story waiting to happen.”Logistically, ReTuna – named because the town’s nickname is Tuna – is an ode to Swedish efficiency.Based next door to one of two municipal recycling centres, townsfolk are encouraged to sort and dispose of their rubbish at that facility before bringing items which might be resold or reused to a drop-off point at the back of the mall.There, in a vast warehouse space, a specialist team sorts these donated goods so that the centre’s shop owners – who all run their stores as independent businesses – can come along and choose what they can fix, convert, refine and, ultimately, put up for sale.“So, all these items are given a new lease of life,” explains Anna, as we walk through this backstage storage space, a veritable Santa’s grotto of indoor and outdoor furniture, electronics, clothes, games, pictures, plant pots, lamps, lights, books, bags, crockery and pottery.Some items here are all but antiques – there’s a stunning Seventies record player nestled next to a Nineties Sega Mega Drive – but others are, quite literally, brand new. I see a mirror still in original packaging and point it out. “I’m afraid some Swedes do have a habit of throwing out very quickly,” winces Anna. “We’ll get TVs from the last year. Laptops also. Or settees that just need a reupholster. But this is good for our shops because it means they get a reputation for stocking high-quality goods.”Why don’t people sell such stuff online instead of donating it here, I ask?\u0026nbsp“Some will, of course,” says Anna. “But giving it to the centre like this is good for the community. It keeps money here, helps local people and businesses, boosts our economy. And what is good for a community is, in the end, good for the inidual too. This is what we say.”Perhaps the best items received so far has been a brooch dating back to 1848. “This we have not put on sale yet,” says Anna. “We think we will get it valued first.”The whole idea was the brainchild of a local Green Party councillor back in the early Noughties. “Perhaps he was what you call a hippy,” says Anna. “But he was a hippy\u0026nbspwho was very good at lobbying, and he made the municipality see the value of this, both as a waste management strategy and a commercial enterprise.”Plans for the mall and next door’s recycling centre became a flagship strand in a raft of environmentally friendly proposals – including running local buses on biogas and giving residents seven different bins – designed to make the former steel town’s economy one of the greenest in Sweden.The idea was then rubber-stamped in 2012 and the building converted with a £1.6m subsidy from the council, which is led by the country’s Social Democrats. Three aims were identified and remain key today: increasing local sustainability, job creation (a dozen people work here, along with roughly 30 shop owners and staff), and offering environmental education.That latter one is fulfilled by an onsite classroom and conference facilities. An oil company was one recent organisation to hire both out for a senior staff awayday. “Kind of ironic,” nods Anna.She\u0026nbspherself\u0026nbspcame on board as manager just before opening.To take what she says is her dream job, she rented a flat in the town, while her family continue to live 50 miles away in Nyköping. “Almost my whole apartment is furnished with things I bought from the mall,” she says. “I love it. My only problem is making sure I don’t spend all my wages here.”Shop owners are just as enthusiastic about the project – although keen to emphasise it has not been easy to establish their stores.Eva Meden quit a high-flying job as a prison boss to set up ReModa, a chic homeware store, with sister Anita Patterssun.“Which was harder work?” the 55-year-old ponders, stood among candles, cake stands and teacups. “I think dealing with prisoners is easy compared to running your own business. But this is so rewarding. You take things, you are creative, fix them up, try and improve them, then sell them on. This is a lovely way to make a living.”Their sales curve, the pair say, is on the “right trajectory”: they moved into a bigger unit in April after more than two years here. “I think some people in Sweden still need persuading that second-hand can be beautiful, but we say ‘Come to our shop and see’,” says 51-year-old Anita.A little way along the mezzanine floor is Amjad Al Chamaa, manager of Re:Compute:IT.Here, in a Steptoe’s Yard of electronics, he stocks everything from battered guitar amps and VHS video recorders (popular with people wanting to watch mum and dad’s old wedding footage, apparently) to state-of-the-art laptops and smart TVs. One, currently on sale at £1,200, is a 2018 Philips model.“Nice TV,” nods the 35-year-old. “Although the funny things is people come here looking for something as new as possible but they see the older stuff, see how great it looks and that it still works – things was built to last back then – and end up buying that instead.”He shrugs. “A Seventies TV – you don’t find this in a regular mall.”His shop, he adds, is especially popular with Eskilstuna’s 5,000-strong immigrant population. “I’m from Syria myself so I know this,” he says. “When you’re new to a place, you need bargains.”Bargains, indeed, are something ReTuna, as a whole, is hoping will keep attracting shoppers.Events such as a semi-regular Crazy Monday, when all prices are reduced, opening hours increased and entertainment put on, have attracted thousands through the doors.Yet more perhaps does still need to be done to prove this concept can become a long-term success.Back on the roof terrace with Anna, she reveals she is looking to have a supermarket onsite as an anchor tenant.“Obviously you can’t sell pre-loved food,” she smiles. “But there’s no reason you couldn’t strike a deal with Aldi, for instance, to have a supermarket here specialising in sustainable goods. For them, it is an experiment of something they might do more widely in the future. For us, it brings people onto\u0026nbspsite.”A salon and an ethical shoe shop are also tenants she is specifically aiming for next. “The key is to keep being imaginative and thinking big,” she says.Talking of which, I ask her about that possible speaking engagement for the International Council of Shopping Centers. Will she do it, I wonder?“Well, of course, it would mean speaking in English, which is not always easy,” she says in near-perfect English. “But I think it would be worthwhile.

The international community considers both areas to be occupied territory, and the Palestinians seek them as parts of a future independent state.\u0026nbspSur Baher\u0027s location has placed it in the centre of these disputes. Parts of the village lie inside the municipal boundary of Israeli-occupied east Jerusalem and parts outside the barrier, in the West Bank. But some lies in between: just outside the Jerusalem line but still on the Israeli side of the barrier.Palestinian owners say their buildings lay within areas run by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. But Israel’s Supreme Court rejected a final appeal from residents of Sur Baher this month, clearing the way for the demolitions. \u0026nbspGilad Erdan, Israel\u0027s minister of public security, said the Supreme Court ruled the illegal construction constitutes a severe security threat and can provide cover to suicide bombers and other terrorists hiding among civilian population.\u0026nbspPalestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh described the demolitions as a “grave aggression.”Sur Baher (EPA)This is a continuation of the forced displacement of the people of Jerusalem from their homes and lands — a war crime and a crime against humanity, he said.The European Union criticised the demolitions, saying in a statement that “the continuation of this policy undermines the viability of the two-state solution and the prospect for a lasting peace.Jamie McGoldrick, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator, and other UN officials called on the Israeli authorities last week to halt the demolition plans. They said 17 Palestinians faced displacement from the plans to level 10 buildings, including dozens of apartments.With additional reporting by agencies\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So will Ireland’s and the continent’s. Jobs will be lost.But what alternative is therethe EU and the Irish PM refuse to confront reality and make the deal palatable And taking as gospel the official forecast of a year-long recession costing £billion neglects three crucial things:That will need a dynamic new Chancellor. The existing one, Philip Hammond, is too busy shamefully betraying his own Government and scorching the earth for the incoming regime.If No Deal IS a disaster, his miserable defeatism will be partly to blame.THE BBC’s betrayal of old folk becomes yet more sickening.Not content with stripping them of their free licence while paying millions to the likes of Gary Lineker, it intends to send out enforcers to demand the cash.These goons hammering on the doors of traumatised and confused OAPs are absurdly described as an “outreach team” carrying out a “support visit”.But the BBC’s self-harm doesn’t stop there. It turns out its breach of the funding deal with the Government will trigger a stampede of pension credit claims to qualy for an exemption from the fee.Cost to taxpayers . . . £.billion.This PM has given up.

The defendant was a few steps away from the mother.At that stage the mother said what are you doing, this is my son and that caused the defendant to let go of the sons hand.The court heard how Shepherd had several problems and had been prescribed an opiate-based painkiller.She had taken more than her prescribed amount earlier that day and had no recollection of the offences taking place in December last year.Shepherd told police she couldnt remember having any contact with any children and didnt intend to kidnap anyone.She was shown the footage and said that it was bad. She was apologetic and couldnt explain why she behaved the way she did and expressed remorse for scaring the children.During the hearing, a victim statement from each of the mothers was read out.Mr Kemp read the statement out from the mother of the first incident: The incident left me in shock.She wouldnt let go of my hand.

secretions are thought to stave off signs of ageing as well as giving skin a “glowing” quality.As a result a raft of new snail farms have sprung up in the Far Eastern country as demand for the slippery shell-dwellers “mucin” rises.Over the last three years, farmers and entrepreneurial locals have begun keeping the snails that were once regarded as a plague on the crops.Snail slime has become worth more than gold with a snail mucin face mask costing upwards of £.Altogether the global slime industry is worth an estimated £ million.There are now more than  snail farms in the Thai province of Nakhon Nayok, two hours east of Bangkok.Phatinisiri Thangkeaw, a teacher, said she had begun her business by buying snails from nearby rice farmers, who were glad to be rid of them because they wreak havoc on newly planted crops.She pays local farmers around  for a kilogram of snails and now has more than , snails that she milks for their mucin and then sells.She told the : “Farmers used to throw them on the road or in the rivers but now they sell them to me to earn extra money.”The process of harvesting the slime is seen as humane, involving dripping water over the snails to encourage them to secrete the mucin, which does not kill or harm them.To keep the quality high, in Thailand the snails are fed vegetables and grains and are only milked once every three weeks.In Thailand, the raw mucin is all flogged to one cosmetics company, Aden International, which was established after Kitpong Puttarathuvanun saw a gap in the market.The businessman sells the slime both as an expensive serum and a dried powder.It was in the s that the potential of snail secretions were noticed by breeders in Chile, who marvelled at how soft their hands became after handling the slimy critters.The first cream containing snail mucin was produced in Chile, but more recently it has boomed in the Korean and American beauty market.The mucin contains ingredients like glycoproteins, hyaluronic acid, and glycolic acid.These chemicals are said to stimulate collagen, slowing the onset of wrinkles and healing acne and reducing scar tissue, though dermatologists are ided on the benefits.Other bizarre beauty treatments to hit the headlines recently include creams made from circumcised foreskins and “vampire facials” which involve rubbing your own blood on your face."},{"url":null,"title":"iran uk tanker picture crew news latest","story":"The image, taken on board the Stena Impero, shows the terried crew members currently being held captive in the Persian Gulf.A pile of shoes can also be seen in the foreground, while what looks like makesht bedding is scattered around the room.The picture was taken yesterday and released by Fars News Agency, a news agency with close ties to the Iranian regime.Other images show an Iranian soldier patrolling one of the ships walkways and the ship seen from a distance down the barrel of a rle.Iran launched a gunboat and helicopter raid on the UK-registered ship last week, claiming the vessel had turned off its tracker and ignored warnings after hitting a fishing boat.Irans Revolutionary Guard later said on the countrys state television that the ship had been boarded for violating international maritime rules.But Stena Bulk, which owns the ship, said it was in “full compliance with all navigation and international regulations”.The firm said Iranian authorities had told them the crew were in “good health” and being held at Iranian port Bandar Abbas.But in a further taunt to the Royal Navy, Iran last night hoisted an Iranian flag over the vessel.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called the seizure illegal and said that British shipping “must and will be protected”.Dramatic footage released on Saturday showed the moment Tehran troops abseiled onto the ship the night before.The clip is thought to have been filmed in the southern port of Bandar Abbas, where jet boats have been sailing around the British ship.It has also emerged Tehran wants to impose a toll on all ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz, saying it would be used to protect the safety of the vessels.Any move to create a toll is likely to be met with hostility as a fth of the worlds oil passes through the strait.On Saturday, state-funded Press TV published an article, entitled From Piracy to Impotence, criticising British activity in the Gulf.Diplomatic spats aside, any objective review of the facts will not fail to recognise that in recent events in the Persian Gulf and the Gibraltar Strait, the UK has engaged in illegal, and destabilising, activities on at least three occasions, it said.Audio has also emerged of radio exchanges between the British warship and Iranian armed forces before it was taken.In the recording, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard can be heard telling the Impero: If you obey, you will be safe. Alter course to  degrees immediately, over.After that, HMS Montrose can be heard telling the crew: This is British warship F.I reiterate, that as you are conducting transit passage in a recognised international strait, under international law your passage must not be impaired, impeded, obstructed or hampered.The frigate then asks the Iranian vessel to confirm it is not intending to violate international law by attempting to board the tanker, in the recording obtained by security firm Dryad Global.Moments later, Iranian special forces stormed the ship by abseiling down from a helicopter.Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, said that HMS Montrose had been an hour away from the Impero, too far to physically stop the seizure.Montrose is the only warship Britain has in the Gulf to cover the -mile strait.However, the government has not arranged fixed times at which civilian vessels from the UK could sail through the Strait under the protection of the frigate, as it has done previously to guard against Somali pirates.It can also be revealed that in April Britain withdrew two Royal Navy Wildcat helicopters, which were based close by in Oman and provided surveillance of the Strait for hostile Iranian activity.It said at the time they were “no longer needed”.A nuclear-powered submarine and Royal Marine Commandos could now be sent to bolster Navy defences in the Gulf.The moves were discussed at emergency meetings of the Government’s Cobra security committee after Friday’s hijacks.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned Iran it was choosing a “dangerous path” with its “totally unacceptable” actions in the Gulf.He said he had spoken to Iran’s foreign minister to voice his “extreme disappointment”.Last night Mr Hunt announced he had raised the maritime threat level to “level three” — or “critical.”The Tory leadership candidate is expected to use a Commons statement today to announce a package of diplomatic and economic measures.The UK could also push for EU and UN sanctions to be reimposed on the regime after they were lted in  as part of a deal on Irans nuclear programme.The UK and the EU have so far shown a willingness to help Iran ease the impact of sanctions reimposed by the US last year after President Trumps decision to withdraw from the deal.Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood today warned the Royal Navy is too small to protect British ships from Iran.He also threatened to freeze the countrys assetsit doesnt release the UK tanker.Askedthe drastic move was being considered, Mr Ellwood said: Cobra was taking place yesterday, so were looking at the operational responsibilities from that but, yes, we are going to be looking at a series of options."},{"url":null,"title":"britains new prime minister boris","story":"NewsBritains new prime minister: Will it be Boris Johnson and when do we find out Boris Johnson is widely-expected to take over from Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the UKShareCommentsByTom DavidsonSenior Reporter:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video nigel-nelson-could-four-prime-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain will have a new Prime Minister this week as Theresa May steps down after a tumultuous three years in office.

Weaposve taken a look back at how Prince George and Princess Charlotte have celebrated their birthdays so far.  Prince George First birthday Kate and Wills threw a aposlow-keyapos tea party for their first born to mark his birthday at Kensington Palace. Guests began to arrive from pm, with Kate’s parents Carole and Michael pulling up first, followed by Kate and William’s former Principal Private Secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, who is one of George’s seven godparents, carrying a brightly wrapped present. Kate’s brother James and sister Pippa, William’s cousin Zara Phillips and her husband Mike Tindall also attended. But great-granny the Queen was the guest of honour, arriving an hour after the party started in a green Bentley. As you do. Prince Philip was unable to attend, but Kate and Wills took little George to Buckingham Palace in the morning so he could see his great-granddad on his special day.  Wills and Kate issued a statement on the eve of their son’s birthday to thank everyone for their good wishes for George. They said: We would like to take this opportunity on George’s first birthday to thank everyone over the last year, wherever we have met them, both at home and overseas, for their warm and generous good wishes to George and our family. They also shared adorable new photos of him, taken at the Natural History Museum just before his big day. Second birthday Another year, another very royal party! By this point, Kate and Wills have moved to Anmer Hall in Norfolk, so held the celebrations there. They invited about a dozen youngsters to the party, as well as their close family. Many of the royals had to miss the event as they were on official duties, but William was given time off to celebrate. Prince Philip also managed to make a surprise visit having missed the previous yearaposs celebrations. The party lasted for about an hour and a half. And of course, another gorgeous photo. This time the family picked a picture of William holding George, who is leaning towards the camera with a huge cheeky grin on his face. Third birthday Kate and Wills released a series of new photos of the growing prince to mark the big number three. The royal family released four lovely pictures of George with the caption: Canapost believe itaposs been three years already! In one of the photos, George is feeding the Cambridgesapos dog Lupo an ice cream.  Fourth birthday The prince spent the run-up to his big day on an official tour of Poland and Germany with his parents. During the trip the little royal was spotted beaming from ear to ear as he sat in the cockpit of a helicopter. Kate and William shared a photo of Prince George with a huge smile on his face to mark the birthday. Kensington Palace said in a statement: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to share a new official portrait of Prince George to mark His Royal Highnessaposs fourth birthday tomorrow.    The photograph was taken at Kensington Palace at the end of June by Chris Jackson, Getty Images Royal Photographer. The Duke and Duchess are very pleased to share this lovely picture as they celebrate Prince Georgeaposs fourth birthday, and would like to thank everyone for all of the kind messages they have received. Fth birthday Prince George celebrated his fth birthday on holiday in the Caribbean - lucky kid! It was believed to be the familyaposs first holiday as a five, after the birth of Prince Louis in April, and weaposre sure they had a lovely time. They reportedly went to Mustique, an island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Sixth birthday George is celebrating turning six with his family at their country estate Anmer Hall in Norfolk and weaposre sure Kate and Wills have got some lovely things planned. There have also been reports that he will be having a small party with some of his school friends when he gets back to London.  The family also released three new photos of the little prince to mark the occasion, including two of him wearing his England football shirt. Princess Charlotte First birthday The little princess celebrated her first birthday with a party at Anmer Hall in Norfolk. Guests included grandparents Prince Charles, and Carole and Michael Middleton. Kate and William released four new adorable photos of Charlotte playing happily at home to mark the occasion. One of the pictures, taken in the garden, shows her standing up while holding onto one of her toys.  A Kensington Palace spokesman said: The Duke and Duchess are delighted to share new photographs of Princess Charlotte. The Duchess took these pictures of her daughter in April at their home in Norfolk.  The Duke and Duchess are happy to be able to share these family moments, ahead of their daughteraposs first birthday. We hope that everyone enjoys these lovely photos as much as we do. Second birthday During her second year, we only saw little Charlotte a handful of times as her parents were keen to keep her out of the public eye. However they released another adorable photo of her to celebrate her birthday.  A spokesperson for the royal family said: Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank everyone for all of the lovely messages they have received, and hope that everyone enjoys this photograph of Princess Charlotte as much as they do. The photo was taken by mum Kate. Third birthday Princess Charlotte celebrated her third birthday just days after her little brother Prince Louis was born, so we imagine it was quite a quiet affair. A few days before her birthday the Queen fly to Kensington Palace in a helicopter to see her - and meet baby Louis. The family didnapost realise a new photo to celebrate, instead posting an old photo of the her on her first day at Willcocks Nursery School, taken by mum Kate. The tweet from the official Kensington Palace account said: Wishing a happy third birthday to Princess Charlotte – thank you all for your lovely messages!

At the age of just  Clinch became one of the youngest children in Britain to get an ASBO after he terrorised locals in his neighbourhood. But despite him being named and shamed by a court, Clinch has clocked up  offences on his record including criminal damage, harassment and assault. He was arrested again last November after he gave a man an unprovoked beating whilst drunk following a house party near his home in Little Lever, Bolton, Greater Manchester.    Victim Paul Cauldwell suffered a broken nose, bruising and swelling to the face plus two lacerations to the left side of the forehead and a nasal fracture in the attack and feared losing his job due to time he took off work. At Bolton Crown Court, Clinch, who admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm, faced jail and he even brought an overnight bag with him in the dock.But he escaped with a suspended sentence a judge said the community would aposaposbenefitaposapos from him addressing his behaviour with probation officers.

Police received a string of complaints about Clinch spitting and swearing at passers by, making sexual remarks at teachers after being expelled from Little Lever High School. He was also accused of stealing lead from the school roof, smashing a bus station window, stealing a case of lager from an off licence and even assaulting his own aunt and driving her Fiat Brava off her driveway and into a road after she refused to take him to a friendaposs house.  He was later issued with an ASBO banning him from behaving badly for two years and officers issued a mugshot of his baby face describing him as a one-boy crimewave and a aposaposwalking timebomb.aposapos At the time Clinchaposs mother Victoria blamed her sonaposs behaviour on him having ADHD and smoking cannabis and said: Itaposs ridiculous to write someone off at  years old when they havenapost tried other solutions. aposaposThe stigma of this will be with him forever and I donapost think he can come back to Bolton and lead a normal le after being labelled.What was said in court was unfair - itaposs wrong to brand a child of that age an animal.

Prosecuting, Robert Smith said: “They’d known each other for some years and decided to go to a party where alcohol and drugs were being consumed. “After leaving the party the pair decided to go back to Mr Cauldwell’s house and continued to drink. This is where the assault occurred.The defendant attacked Mr Cauldwell punching his jaw and kicking at him with the victim falling to the floor. The defendant continued to punch and kick Mr Caldwell whilst he lay in a ball on the floor trying to protect himself. aposaposThe defendant has  separate offences on his record, criminal damage, harassment, common assault, disorderly behaviour, drunk and disorderly, theft and threatening behaviour.” In a statement Mr Cauldwell said: “I was in a lot of pain following this incident. There was no explanation for the attack.I offered him somewhere to stay and that’s how I was repaid. I had to take time off work I was in so much pain. At one point I thought I may lose my job.”  In mitigation defence lawyer Simon Gurney said: “He does have antecedents but he thought he had put that past behind him. He has not been in trouble recently.This offence is isolated against that background - a couple of old friends drinking to excess and then play fighting which got out of hand. aposaposMy client concedes he used excessive force and accepts this offence crosses the threshold. But he has had five years without offending and he hopes this has not undone the good work done in those five years.” Clinch was given  months jail suspended for two years and will be electronically tagged as part of a four month curfew from pm to am.

Kelly Shepherd tried to snatch the children while their mothers were shopping inside a toy shop at Intu Derby. Derby Crown Court heard how the -year-old was acting out of this world in the Entertainer store at the mall, last December. A judge described her actions as terrying. CCTV footage showed how she approached two children in two separate incidents at the mall on the same day - grabbing one of them by the hand, before their mothers pulled them back, reports Derbyshire Live .    Both children were affected by the incidents, with one of the youngsters becoming clingy ever since, .  The court heard how Shepherd had several problems and had been prescribed an opiate-based painkiller. She had taken more than her prescribed amount earlier that day and had no recollection of the offences taking place. Judge Robert Egbuna, who presided over the case, described the offences as terrying, but said this was not a classic case of attempted kidnap and that it wasnapost pre-planned. He handed Shepherd a community order for her actions.    Stephen Kemp, prosecuting, said the first incident took place on December , and involved a mother and her daughter who were Christmas shopping. He said: The mother described seeing a woman in the toy shop and described her as being aposmentally unstableapos. The daughter was playing with some toys and the defendant came from behind and told her to put the toys down.

Mr Kemp said: The mother described a woman she didnapost know reaching out and taking hold of her sonaposs hand. The defendant was a few steps away from the mother.

Called the Cognitive Reflection Test, the quiz isnapost new, but was originally part of a research paper published in  by MIT professor Shane Frederick. This paper has recently resurfaced online, leaving many keen to give it a go. As part of his research, Professor Frederick had more than , participants from a range of educational backgrounds complete the test - and even those attending top American universities such as Yale and Hard struggled to work out all the answers. Of all those who took part only  percent managed to score three out of three on the test, meaning  percent of people failed - how will you fare     Speaking about the test, Professor Frederick, said: The three items on the CRT are aposeasyapos in the sense that their solution is easily understood when explained, yet reaching the correct answer often requires the suppression of an erroneous answer that springs aposimpulsivelyapos to mind.

And Aberdonian Campbell was thrilled to mark his first start in Europe with a win.He said: “It is a dream come true to play in a European competition and to play my part in a win in my first start which takes us through to the next round is fantastic.“I really appreciate the gaffer’s trust in me by putting me into a game like that.“It’s down to me after that to prove why he shows the faith in me and as long as he keeps doing that I have to keep working hard and do as best as I can when I get the opportunity.”Campbell was given the chance to play due to Craig Bryson missing the first round with an ankle injury.With Bryson due to resume training on Sunday and new signing Funso Ojo also joining the squad for next week’s second qualying round tie at Chikhura Sachkhere of Georgia, Campbell faces a fight to keep his place in the side. But he will use team-mate Ferguson’s success in holding down a regular place in the team as inspiration.]He said: “I’m comfortable in this team and feel I can cope with first-team games and European games. I just have to keep working as hard as I can and the manager will keep his faith in me.“Fergie had a terric season last year and will only kick on. He’s a fantastic young player and I enjoy playing alongside him so hopefully this is a partnership which we can develop.”Campbell, a product of the club’s youth system, has grown up watching the first team try to reach the group stages of the competition. This campaign, the sixth in a row under manager Derek McInnes, represents as good an opportunity as any.The importance for the club and the team in making it to the group stages has not been lost on the teenager.Huge clubs such as Premier League Arsenal and Manchester United as well as Italian side Roma lie in wait.The Aberdonian, a lelong Dons fan, is living his dream in being involved in European competition with his home city side.He said: “It’s always been an ambition, even as a little kid, to play in a European competition.“To get my first start is brilliant.I’ve watched the Real Sociedad games, the Groningen games as a fan so to be part of it is great.“All Aberdeen fans know of the glory days against Real Madrid and Bayern Munich but times have changed due to the money in the game now.“We’ve just got to do all we can to get to the group stages and that starts with the next round in Georgia.“It would be absolutely brilliant to get there.“That’s our aim every time we go into this competition and to get through would be fantastic for the players and financially for the club. It’s huge. I want to test myself against the best competition that is out there.“European competition is the cream at the top of the game.”The last time Aberdeen played in the group stages was during Jimmy Calderwood’s reign. The Dons reached the last  of the Uefa Cup in  before being eliminated - on aggregate by German giants Bayern Munich.Campbell was still at primary school during that run but the memories remain vivid today.He said: “I was a season ticket in the South Stand. I used to sit next to the away fans and I loved it. I was at the Bayern game in  and I remember that one and the Copenhagen game.“I would have been seven years old watching games like that so it’s great to be here  years later.“Hopefully I can kick on.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44246950-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44246950-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44246950-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44246950-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"mcinnes started homework early","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes began preparation for the Europa League clash with FC Chikhura Sachkere on the flight back to Scotland after defeating RoPS Rovaniemi in Finland.McInnes studied scouting reports of the Georgians’ two games against CS Fola Esch of Luxembourg in the previous round on the flight which touched down early yesterday morning.He will also study extensive footage of Sachkere who the Dons face at the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, Tbilisi, on Thursday .McInnes said: “We had match reports to read on the Georgians on the plane on the way home and will start to get a grip on them over the next few days.“We had our scouts out for both their games against Fola Esch.

It’s going to let us put names and inidual people to the story of this still.”The record also includes suggestions about where the still may have been located – with the spot believed to be on a street already associated with whisky.Dr Armstrong added: “Andrew Gray had property in a street known as Guestrow.“Today just a small section of Guestrow remains and it is home to the appropriately named ‘Illicit Still’ pub.“The name recalls a later age when whisky was crafted for sale undetected by the taxman, but it is possible that its location has a connection to the history of Scotch going back much further.“This is a very signicant find in the history of our national drink. It reframes the story of Scotch whisky and suggests new layers of complexity in Scotland’s urban history.” vw, px\"  Dr Hawes said: “All references to aquavite or whisky from this period are signicant because its early development is largely unrecorded.“This could signicantly change our understanding of the origins of our national drink.”City archivist Phil Astley added: “This incredible find illustrates what an amazing resource the UNESCO-recognised Aberdeen Burgh Registers are for the study of Scottish urban history.“The detailed picture of late-medieval society that emerges from these records is one of a developing social structure increasingly influenced by the cultural, scientic and educational forces of the Renaissance period.”Researchers have now been awarded £, by Chivas Brothers to fund research into the still.Head of heritage and education Alex Robertson said: “This is a truly signicant and exciting discovery for Scotch whisky.“Given Chivas Brothers’ historical ties with Aberdeen, we did not hesitate to lend our support to the furtherance of this important research.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

already addressed any issues that were raised in the consultation and therefore problems raised by the CAR were no longer applicable.There was also a question over whether the premises planned for the new pharmacy at  Bridge Street would be large enough to support the planned two consultation rooms and dispensary area, which the committee felt raised the issue of whether appropriate confidentiality was possible.Letters of support for the pharmacy were submitted by Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council and ward councillor Kenny McLeod among others however, the committee felt that none of these letters ldquospecied needs which were currently not being met.Pharmacy applicant Niamh Morrison visited the community council to thank members for their support over the process and to assure them that she would be launching an appeal.She said: ldquoI am of course very disappointed.ldquoI really believe that this community needs this, and I have developed a real soft spot for the area.ldquoThe appeal process unfortunately wonrsquot be quick, it could take years.ldquoI just wanted to thank you all for the support that you have given us.The rejection comes not long after Tranent Medical Practice announced that it would be suspending advanced appointments due to a shortage of GPrsquos.Robert McNeill, a member of the community council, said: ldquoFrom a personal point of view, Irsquom very disappointed.ldquoTranent surgery is not unique in its problems and the pharmacy could have added extra services within the community.David Forrest, chairman of the community council added with regards the letter that the group had drafted to support the application: ldquoThe letters that we wrote came from the heart, we really feel that this was what was best for our community.ldquoWe are incredibly disappointed with the decision, and fully support Niamh in her appeal.ldquoWe will be writing to our local MP and MSP to register our frustration at the situation.ldquoThe decision is very short-sighted.The decision comes as planning permission in principle has been approved for  houses at Windygoul South, though the committee determined that both Lloyds and Well Tranent were able to increase capacity should ldquoproposed housebuilding occur locally.Ward councillor Kenny McLeod said: ldquoWith the new houses on their way, the town will need extra pharmacies and more GPs.ldquoIrsquom so disappointed that the pharmacy has been rejected, I really think we need one."},{"url":null,"title":"matt-kuchar-among-four-players-tied-scottish-open-lead-first-day","story":"Kuchar shot an eight-under-par  in todays first round, leaving him tied with Frenchman Romain

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9948769.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

But that is not expected to take long.Malcolm Leslie, director of country house sales in Strutt  Parkerrsquos Edinburgh office, said: ldquoFundamentally, demand outstrips supply and buyers are frustrated at the lack of properties on the market.\"As a result, prime properties which do come to the market are met with exceptional demand, particularly rural family homes within striking distance of urban centres.\"One property recently marketed had more than  viewings in two weeks and attracted several offers at a closing date. It is now under offer.Further north, a sporting estate in one of the most remote locations on the Scottish mainland is being sold for more than pound million. Straddling the western end of Loch Monar in Ross-shire, ,-acre Pait and West Monar Estate is mostly only accessible by boat stis in the shadow of three Munros Sgurr a Chaorachain, Sgurr Choinnich, and Lurg Mhor.But buyers should beware - the main property on the estate, a Victorian hunting lodge, only received electricity in  and is mostly still lit with oil lamps.For househunters whose dream home would boast more environmentally-friendly measures, a specially-constructed four-bedroom family dwelling in Stirlingshire ticks all the right boxes.Muir Estate, near Thornhill, was designed by the Swedish architect Maumlrtha Wachtmeister and the current owner Jimmi Enevoldsen and is now on sale for offers over pound. million.Surrounded by a Christmas tree farm, the lodge was built on the site of a ruin with some of the old stone used in the construction, and is heated through a ground-sourced system while the insulation has been built made  per cent thicker than standard.:From Bigfoot to mermaids and Mars attacks - how hoaxes have fooled the worldMr Enevoldsen said: ldquoWe have enjoyed the secluded nature of the estate and the peace, quiet and wildle that comes with that. The loch is very much as it was when we bought it, an oasis of tranquillity.\"Buying up property and land to help protect the environment is another factor attracting investors to Scotland. Dane Anders Povlsen recently became the countrys largest landowner, after a series of piecemeal acquisitions saw the -year-old has become the owner of  Scottish estates with plan tothem to the wild.Robert McCulloch explained: \"The opportunity to buy large expanses of wild and beautul terrain for the purposes of pursuing a range of objectives relating to natural capital including re-establishment of native species of flora and fauna - lsquorewildingrsquo - and carbon-off setting related to industrial activity where are an increasingly prevalent factor amongst prospective estate buyers whether they are iniduals, corporations or conservation bodies and charitable trusts.\"Closer to home, and on the market for pound. million, the -acre island of Inchmarnock in the Firth of Clyde comes with its own farm and centuries of historyFittingly described by a th century surveyor as a ldquoproper habitation for one in love with a hermetical le, the island is rich in history and natural heritage. A farmer discovered the remains of a local Bronze Age woman, the Queen of the Inch, in the s. She lay in a stone cist wearing a black lignite necklace and carrying a flint dagger.The remains form part of an exhibition in the Natural History Museum in Rothesay. An archaeological project commissioned by the current owner uncovered ious artefacts including carved stones and the largest collection of slate in the British Isles, important because of its implications for monastic schooling. The excavated remains point to the existence of an early Christian centre of some importance.The eighth century saw the island fall prey to Viking raids and it is believed victims of the th century Battle of Largs between Norway and Scotland were buried on the island. Additionally, Inchmarnock is rumoured to have been popular with smugglers, its woodland and craggy shoreline an ideal hiding place for contraband.Meanwhile in the th century, legend has it that an alcoholic from Bute was banished alone to Inchmarnock to overcome her addiction.More recently, the island was used as a training ground for D-Day preparations in World War Two and bomb craters are still evident.Inchmarnock was once home to  residents but the final permanent resident, a Bute farming tenant, left the island in .But it is not only windswept moors, Lochside retreats and isolated islands which are being rated as the most desirable property purchases in Scotland. Townhouses and chic urban dwellings also make the list, especially in Edinburgh, Scotlands fastest-growing property market for a number of years.Estate agents have flagged up Northhumberland Street , a six-bedroom full townhouse with private garden in the heart of the capitals Georgian New Town as an example of the type of prime property changing hands with asking prices in the millions.The dwelling, priced at offers over poundmillion, is spread over two storeys and sits close to exclusive schools such as the Edinburgh Academy, Fettes College, St Georges School for Girls.Andrew Riddell, senior associate director in Strutt  Parkerrsquos Edinburgh office, said: ldquoFamily homes in Edinburgh are very, very popular and competition is fierce when prime properties come to the market. The most sought after are in New Town, Stockbridge, the West End, Murrayfield, Morningside, Bruntsfield and the Grange.\"I have recently marketed several family homes which have attracted stf competition and either gone under offer within days of coming to the market or gone to a closing date. They often sell for around  per cent more than valuation.

Any sensible organisation would confirm something as serious as that.

He is taking up more of my free time than I would like him to, trying to build up and collect all this evidence, and theyrsquove done absolutely nothing by the looks of it. Nothing whatsoever.\"Following the members complaint, but before Gregson was suspended from Labour, he brought forward a motion at the Edinburgh Central branch ,meeting calling for the group to object to Labours definition of anti-Semitism,He also called for an \"end to disciplinary actions against any affected member, shop steward, Labourist or employee accused of anti-Semitism under this definition\".The whistleblower said: \"When he brought forward this motion I was even more angry, as I knew I had complained, and others had complained, and yet he was able to just bring forward this motion to the branch.\"Sadly it is situations like this which are causing Labour to lose face. \"I fear the party as it was before the days of Jeremy Corbyn is pretty much lost for a generation now.\"I joined the party because I believed in their principles of wanting to help everyone and treat everybody equally. I joined to fight for things like that, not to fight other members.

The drive to eliminate unnecessary plastic waste meant that kg of waste ndash  per cent of all waste generated ndash was recycled at the end of last yearrsquos festival, which attracted , people.The heavy sum equals  per cent of all waste generated at the event, which last year saw , people attend. Paper, cardboard and other materials were either recycled or sent to a digester and erted from landfill.Ian Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: ldquoHebCelt has been a leader in recent years for more environmentally friendly festivals through the introduction of reusable cups and other measures, such as the decision to ban single-use plastic and use recyclable and biodegradable alternatives instead.ldquoThese moves show a step in the right direction as single-use packaging is often a problem at large-scale events.ldquoThe environmental impact from this type of large-scale event can be reduced by removing any unnecessary item or replacing it with a re-usable alternative.Greenpeace estimates that around . million tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans each year across the world, and green charities from across the country say while festivals play a large part in contributing to plastic waste they also raise awareness of its environmental impact.ldquoIt is great to see Hebridean Celtic Festival continuing to take action to reduce their climate and environmental impact, said climate campaigner of Friends of Earth Scotland Caroline Rance.ldquoAll business and institutions must take steps to signicantly cut their use of fossil fuels and lessen their organisationrsquos contribution to climate change.ldquoFestivals, and the arts more widely, have a really important role in engaging people in these important issues and inspiring them to take action.ldquoHebCelt was ahead of the curve in banning plastic straws and introducing reusable cups five years ago, and banning single-use plastic last year.ldquoPlastic pollution is a huge problem which has really captured the public attention, but plastics are indicative of larger problems of our throwaway society that fails to make products that last.ldquoMuch of a festivalrsquos impact comes from transport, and, whilst a festival in the Hebrides presents unique logistical and transport challenges, we would encourage festival organisers to keep thinking about how to get more people to reduce the impact of their journey.Although HebCelt appears to have been ahead of the curve, Ms Maclennan says there is still more to be done.To this end, the festival has joined forces with Tighean Innse Gall , the housing and energy agency for the Outer Hebrides, to help raise awareness of climate change.ldquoWe want to continue to improve our actions and spread the word amongst our audience, artists and contractors, Ms Maclennan said. ldquoThis year, our partnership with TIG will help get the message out to more people which can only help us in our ongoing aims.Not only were the team on site to talk to revellers about the environment, they also supplied an electric Tesla car to drive main headline act KT Tunstall and others to the festival site. ldquoI applaud HebCeltrsquos efforts to tackle environmental issues and raise awareness amongst an international audience, Tunstall said.ldquoWith the help of TIG this year, they are helping to bring important issues to the attention of thousands of people which can only help in the fight against climate change.And it appears other events across the country are also making the switch to more environmentally friendly alternatives to some of the most damaging materialsZero Wastersquos Mr Gulland said: ldquoWersquove grown accustomed to the pictures of piles of litter and waste left behind after festivals, but we are increasingly seeing it does not have to be this way.Mr Gulland added: ldquoThis year, many organisers have noticeably ramped up their sustainability efforts. Glastonbury succeeded in convincing campers to take their tents home and TRNSMT operated a deposit scheme for cups and bottles.Earlier this month, at Glasgowrsquos TRNSMT festival, a deposit scheme was introduced whereby revellers to encourage used cups, made of paper, back to a kiosk to get their p paid at point of purchase.Annually, those attending Glastonbury go through over one million plastic bottles annually, and this year the festival scrapped the offending materials entirely.In Glasgow, summer festival TRNSMT introduced a cupscheme, wherein revelers were asked to bring used drinks cups ndash made of paper ndash to a dedicated kiosk, in exchange for a p deposit paid at point of purchase.Glasgowrsquos TRNSMT aims to remove plastic from its site completely by  and took signicant steps this year by reducing single use plastics and introducing more water refill points."},{"url":null,"title":"tributes-former-msp-trish-godman","story":"Ms Godman represented West Renfrewshire from  until her retirement in , and was Holyroods deputy presiding officer for eight years.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard described Ms Godman as \"determined and principled\".He tweeted: \"On behalf of the Scottish Labour Party, I extend our condolences on the sad news of the death of former Scottish Labour MSP and deputy Presiding Officer Trish Godman.\"Determined and principled, Trish was a great fighter for her constituents and for the Labour Party.

The House of Commons is now very well placed to say whether or not the concept of Brexit placed before the voters at the time of the referendum is still defensible, and henceone can reasonably refer to the will of the people as expressed at that time as still being relevant. Accordingly I believe that a free vote ndash a vote of conscience ndash by the House of Commons, should be held, with two clear options: either to abandon the process of leaving the European Union, or to continue on a path to departure. This move would place Members of Parliament in their proper position as inidual elected representatives in a representative democracy of deciding on behalf of all their constituents which path to follow. Before the vote MPs should, I consider, be reminded that as they represent all their constituents , they must put aside party and personal predilections, and vote on what they believe, in conscience, is in the best interests of all of their constituents, of all of the people of the United Kingdom and of the concept of a peaceful Europe. An analogy would be the vote on the abolition of capital punishment.As there has been ample opportunity for debate prior to this pivotal point, I suggest that the making of speeches before a vote might be ruled out, other than a statement setting out procedure.Professor John R Hume, Glasgow G.THIS may be too obvious to say, but somebody has to: opposition to the Tories is tragically split. The more people change to the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, the more secure the Tories become.In one General Election, the SNP took all the seats in Scotland except one. Did that get the Tories out Whatever you say about Labour right now, the party is all wersquove got. If it won all its seats, the Tories would be out.We have to accept that some people have curious enthusiasms. I cannot believe that any adult would care where a ball lands, but there it is. I cannot believe anybody would be excited about his inadvertent birthplace, but there it is, and it includes my best friends.Now Labour says it is turning Remain. Its leaders must have been reading my letters.My favourite dream is one huge united anti-Tory party, who would concentrate on socialism and European membership, setting aside meantime, anti-Semitism and kne crime. Oh, and Scottish independence.Mrs Moyna Gardner, Glasgow G.Itrsquos a pity these measures werenrsquot taken right across the th century, when Scotlandrsquos economy was directly controlled from London, and suffered much lower growth rates than the UK. As one banker put it some years ago: ldquoScotland was in recession for  years.GR Weir, Ochiltree.MANY people are critical of our politicians, with good reason, but the underlying causes of their poor performance are not clear.One possibility is that the political approach to decision-making is derived from the legal system. Unfortunately, the practice of deciding outcomes by persuasive argument is not always fit for purpose outside the courtroom. Global warming will dominate le on earth for the foreseeable future and no amount of discussion or debate will change this, yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer insists on pointing out that the costs are very high, with the implication that we should continue burning coal, oil and gas. Of course the costs are high, but the alternatives even in the medium term are much worse.Brexit is a classic example of a decision that should be made following a determined and honest attempt to establish the facts and to make those facts public. Instead we have groups of people who think that they can win an argument, based purely on rhetoric. Evenmany of the outcomes are uncertain, there should be a process of evaluation that is not based on \"winning\" or \"losing\".A second possible reason for Westminster politicians to be so incompetent is that many are very poorly educated. To go from an expensive private school to Oxford, where  weeks a year for three years may be spent studying a subject of little or no practical relevance to le on this planet, is not a useful preparation for decision-making in a technically complex world. This is exacerbated by going straight into politics, buoyed by a high level of self-confidence and not the smallest notion of what le is like for those who have to earn a living. Perhaps the worst aspect of this career path is that the ones who end up leading the pack are those with the most confidence, not the clearest thinkers.A third possible reason is that Oxford graduates tend to go back to their professors for advice. If the professors are purely theoretical in their analyses they will be unable to reflect the realities of le and all the real world uncertainties that affect the outcomes of policy decisions.A fourth potential reason is that le in politics is very stressful. This seems to lead to a kind of febrile state, in which the politician loses all contact with reality le becomes a merry-go-round, based on lies and pretence, with the object to become famous rather than to serve.These observations are not specic to one party or another. Whichever way you look at it, the Westminster system needs to be reformed.Roger Waigh, Helensburgh.FOR months you have given over a complete page to letters on Brexit even though Holyrood estimates the financial impact on Scotland will be around pound billion a year.

Aldrin Jr. Neil had ancestral links to Scotland. The name derives from Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the Moon, and the Gaelic word for cow, Bò.Alex Keen, launch specialist from Sent into Space, said: “Launching at Gilnockie Tower was a real treat. Not only were the team from VisitScotland a great bunch to work with but the countryside we crossed in pursuit of our payload is one of the most beautul and dramatic landscapes we’ve visited. “Once the Coosmonaut was back in our hands, we were genuinely sad to leave and head back to England.”A new tourism map highlighting Scotland’s links to space exploration and the first moonwalk has also been released.On the new trail...among the Scottish landmarks on the new VisitScotland map is the dark sky observatory in Dalmellington, Ayrshire.The Scotland is Out of this World trail is part of the new VisitScotland campaign of the same name.The trail features Scottish connections to each planet in the solar system, as well as fun facts and details of science centres and the best places to stargaze.Highlights incude:data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.berwickshirenews webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"This is what , can fetch you across the UK\"  This is what you can rent for £, per month across the UK viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BERN | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BERN | Article Teaser\"Mars – Glenelg, Highlands: In  the village twinnedwith a geological feature on Mars, called Glenelg.Jupiter – Loch Airigh, Isle of Harris: The loch in the Outer Hebrides portrays the planet Jupiter in the  Stanley Kubrick directed film, : A Space Odyssey.Uranus – Braemar: The birthplace of Johann von Lamont, an astronomer who calculated the mass of Uranus.Neptune – Jedburgh, Scottish Borders: The birthplace of th century science writer Mary Somerville who theorised that dficulties in calculating the position of Uranus may point to an undiscovered planet, which inspired the discovery of Neptune.Venus – Parton, Dumfries and Galloway: The resting place of th century physicist James Clerk Maxwell, whose name was given to Maxwell Montes, the planet’s only feature named after a man.The Scotland is Out of this World campaign marks the th anniversary of the Apollo  mission and US astronaut Neil Armstrong’s historic walk on the lunar surface.But it also celebrates the th anniversary of VisitScotland.Malcolm Roughead, chief executive, said: “For  years VisitScotland has helped position Scotland as a must-visit destination to audiences across the world.“It is therefore fitting that in our anniversary year we set our sights even further and travelled into space in what can only be described as a truly out of this world campaign.“Scotland is Out of this World offered the opportunity to delve into the past and celebrate the country’s contribution to space exploration and its ancestral links to one of the greatest moments in history.“The new trail reveals some of the country’s stellar attractions and locations to visit to firmly cement Scotland’s place in astro-tourism. “After all, our best views aren’t confined to our awe-inspiring landscapes but reach up high into the night sky above as well.”Ohio-born Neil Armstrong was proud of his Scottish heritage.

Managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “HIAL’s commitment to access for all passengers has been recognised for a third year by the CAA, acknowledging the hard work by all our staff to ensure our airports are as inclusive as possible.#As an organisation, we work with local disability organisations and iniduals to ensure we are always improving our offerings to better meet their needs and provide assistance where required.“For Kirkwall to be listed as Very Good in its first year of reaching the required passenger threshold is a testament to the hard work staff put in to accommodate disabled and mobility restricted passengers.“Kirkwall has made several upgrades to its facilities for those with additional needs in recent years including changing the flooring in the security area from carpet to lino and adding additional counter space in disabled toilets.“We continue to invest and improve and will provide staff with additional disabilities training.#The CAA’s framework was introduced to ensure there is a consistent and high-quality service for disabled passengers across UK airports. The CAA assesses airports against a number of measures to establish how well they are performing for disabled passengers.

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. So far Prospect has continued to ask for a pay increase far in excess of what we are able to afford and that unfortunately remains the situation.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute. Our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five year period remains on the table and will continue to explore potential solutions within our affordability.”“The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our passengers, communities and the airlines operating from our airports.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

NorthLink Ferries’ two freight vessels, Helliar and Hildasay, were instrumental in the product development and field testing.Ian Livingstone, managing director of Ankaa, said: “The maritime community has always been challenged with effectively managing, sharing and ensuring validity of seafarer’s data. This has become more dficult with tightening data privacy legislation globally. The maritime world has been slow to adopt digital solutions and reluctant to embrace collaboration. We were very frustrated with the products available on the market being unable to offer a user-friendly but complete approach to industry-wide problems. Ankaa Marine was specically designed by seafarers for seafarers to offer the sector a simple solution.”Stuart Garrett, Serco’s managing director for NorthLink Ferries, added: “We never stand still and are always looking for ways to improve our operations.

During their whistle stop tours of the land, much of the talk has, naturally, been about Brexit, our relationship with the United States and promises of tax cuts for iniduals and businesses.While these issues may capture the imagination of the , Tory party members, who are deciding who will be our next PM, there are plenty of other pressing matters that the next resident of No  Downing Street will need to keep in mind. Ensuring that everybody has access to a good workplace pension is one of them.As it stands, there are more people saving in a pension than at any time in our history. This is down to the success of auto-enrolment pensions – a policy that has welcomed some  million new pensions savers since .It has been a genuine success. So far. But there is more to do. Contributions from inidual workers and their employers have gradually been rising from a low base, reaching eight per cent of salary in April of this year.Monitoring how employees have responded to the April increase is crucial before any further tweaks are made to auto-enrolment policy.Westminster itself recognises the need for improvement. The  Auto Enrolment Review endorsed the case for making pensions contributions count from the first pound of salary, rather than anything after £,. This would have a material effect on the prospects of lower and middle-income workers building up a decent sized pot for retirement. But no timetable has yet emerged for implementation.Politics is in flux of course and commitments can fall by the wayside. But this delay is sensible. Auto-enrolment has worked so far because it has been evidence-based. It would also be important to stage gradually the implementation of a “contributions from the first pound earned” policy because of its greater impact on lower earners.More immediately, the government should consider measures to bring the benefits of auto-enrolment pension saving to more women.Women make up only around a third of those auto-enrolled so far. Reducing the “enrolment trigger” from £, a year from one job to the primary National Insurance threshold level – £, – would bring the benefits of auto-enrolment to another half a million people, three-quarters of whom would be women.This would help auto-enrolment play its full role in tackling the gender pensions gap. As things stand the average woman retires with a pension income £, less than her male counterpart. Women more often take a break from full-time work to raise a family, with a long-term knock on effect on their pension savings. More affordable and accessible childcare would help the four in  women who have said they would like to work more hourschildcare was more accessible.One bright idea is to encourage childcare businesses to open in town centres – a move which would help both Messrs Hunt and Johnson achieve their stated aim of “saving the High Street”.While I don’t believe for one second that either candidate will spend the coming days discussing the vagaries of auto-enrolment pensions, they will do well to remember that people really do need a guiding hand when it comes to securing their future.Gregg McClymont is head of policy at The People’s Pension and former shadow pensions minister.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects.

If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”.

I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example.

The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.IFLAS is a global hub of inquiry, teaching, and dialogue on enabling the transition to more fair and sustainable societies.All that is pure Mikey Mouse to a true Scientist!!!Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green . For women it is only .%. As for shades of green —- no chance for men !Maybe that’s one of the reasons why some of themcan’t resist verbal battles.Green for GO and they can’t stop . 🔴Thanks to Brian for those interesting links. The second, albeit straight from a professor in the field, might also not pass Ian’s test, but both seem to provide plenty of evidence it is more than reasonable for the kids to be concerned.  If we can agree this as a reliable source it might then be possible to make more progress on whether the kids actually are right, and or have a right, to be concerned.The clue to where their bias lies is in the name #statutory Committee for Climate Change# not climate science or climate research but climate#change#Nigel Farage will save the world.I have never claimed the children have no right to feel concerned, just that school strikes are a pointless, stupid action endorsed but fools and the politically motivated, that is my opinion no more no less.Relax kids! Theres no proof of climate crisis worldwide, says self-proclaimed “true Scientist” Ian Tinkler, yet our national climate scientic advisors think there is. Who is right  Hint, Ian hasn’t shared where he gets his reliable info.The government listens to an armsindependent body of expects established by law because it knows there is a problem. Ali, however, spies a plot con. Some of Ali’s previous alien-culture ideas have been shown to be a little further to the right than those most Tories admit to, so we can but guess where he gets them from.John and Ian have both recently had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg. They, with Ian, are strongly pro-Brexit. There is a possible common connection  cause. The far-right internationally have begun to target Greta whilst denying the dangers of global warming. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read thearticle “Germany’s AfD turns on Greta Thunberg as it embraces climate change denial” from June th.The AfD is a extremist far-right racist party which democrats should oppose.

This, she says, will leave her struggling to make ends met.Following their benefits blunder, the department now plans to take the money from Mrs McLaughlin’s existing benefits, which she depends on to survive.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs McLaughlin told how she felt like she had “committed a crime” during her PIP assessment.“When I went for the PIP assessment I went to Citizens’ Advice to help us out and a girl came along to represent me,” she said.“She was talking me through it outside because I got myself up to high doh over it.“When I went in the pressure just got the better of me. I was being asked questions and some of them I found hard to answer. I answered to the best of my knowledge, but I felt asI had committed a crime and I was in front of a  of judges.”Despite winning her appeal, she must now pay back £. per month out of her already meagre benefits. As well as the impact on her mental health, Mrs McLaughlin said she will “struggle” just to make ends meet.“The only thing we had to live off was ESA, which was only £ between us,” she said.“Why are they sending us this letter a year later saying that we have to pay the money back  It came as a complete shock. I rang and explained the circumstances, but I was just told that I have to pay it back by law. I understand that they gave us the money to pull us through, but why did they leave it for a year and let it mount up  At the end of the day the fault lies with them, but we are the ones being penalised. She put me onto a debt management line and I was toldI didn’t agree to pay it then they would start taking it out of my benefits anyway because my money comes from them.“We’re trying to run a house, we have oil and food to pay for, we don’t have a car but we have buses and taxi fares to pay for too. It puts me under a lot of pressure. I was trying to work out what it’s going to cost me and it’s going to take over a year and a half to pay it. I don’t know how I’m going to afford it. I received a letter a few months ago about going back to work. I can’t start work due to my health issues, and I only have another year left on my ESA – I have to re-appeal that. I don’t knowI’m going to get it back or not, so how am I going to make these payments ”She added: “I was only starting to relax and feel a bit better lately. I’m on a lot of medication for it. This has put a lot of pressure on me. I was in a complete state over this letter, but there’s nothing I can do – they’re going to take the money anyway.”A spokesperson for the Department for Communities, said: “Welfare Supplementary Payments are available to existing Disability Living Allowance claimants who experiences a loss of benefit following a reassessment to Personal Independence Paymenthowever depending on a person’s circumstances they may be entitled to more than one type of WSP arising from loss of DLA.“Claimants who do not qualy for PIP and subsequently successfully appeal the decision receive Welfare Supplementary Payments equal to the weekly rate of their previous Disability Living Allowance payments. In the event of a successful appeal and in line with the legislation the Department carries out an adjustment on any arrears due to ensure that an overpayment does not occur hence the claimant does not lose out financially.“However, in some circumstances e.g. where a WSP is paid for loss of a Carers Premium the legislation does not provide for an offset process to allow arrears of Carers Allowance benefit to be adjusted following a successful PIP appeal. Instead all arrears of Carers Allowance must be paid to the carer and recovery of the overpayment of the WSP sought from the person who actually received it however again in these circumstance neither the claimant nor the carer has lost out financially.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rte to broadcast glenanne film","story":"RTÉ is to broadcast a documentary by a West Belfast film-maker about the notorious loyalist Glenanne Gang, believed to be responsible for over  sectarian killings of Catholics during the Troubles, mainly in counties Armagh and Tyrone.Unquiet Graves will air next week, July  at .pm.The Glenanne Gang, which also contained members of the legal British Army UDR among its number, was also responsible for the Dublin-Monaghan bombings which killed  civilians in May , as well as the Miama Showband massacre in .Seán Murray’s film– which is narrated by the Oscar-nominated actor Stephen Rea – has previously been shown at An Chultúrlann and at the Movie House cinema in Belfast.Murray tweeted: “I can now announce that Unquiet Graves will be screening on RTÉ  on Monday the th of July at .pm. “This is of immense importance to the #Glenanne families# and is a major milestone on the road to justice.

The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry. George was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and began a career in banking after emigrating. He enlisted in the th Canadian Battalion at the rank of Liuetenant on November ,  and later transferred to the th Canadian Battalion.  He saw action at the Somme in July,  and in April,  at Vimy Ridge where he was wounded and suffered injuries to his left femur and left foot. He was demobilised in July,  and ed to Canada where he became a farmer.CAPTION: The Reverend Robert William Ross."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group says opportunity lifetime north west must seized","story":"The Derry University Group say that civic society has a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity to build a new, dedicated university in the North West.A spokesperson for the group told the Derry News: “This is the opportunity of a letime. There is currently, after years of campaigning, a genuine momentum of support building in Dublin and in London for a new university here.“We need to harness this carefully and creatively, to deliver a standalone Higher Education institution for our city region.“There is a real chance to redress  years of isolation and alienation and to build hope and prosperity for future generations in northwest Ireland.“We must be careful not to be side-tracked into short-term fixes as we have been before. We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there. This is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. We have a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity and build a new, dedicated university in the North West.”The Derry University Group, which is based at Ráth Mór, was established in  by Conal McFeely, Diane Greer and Garbhan Downey.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"eamonn mccann derry treated contempt nationalist leadership","story":"By Eamonn McCanngoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe neglect of Derry on both university education and rail links has been blamed for  years on sectarian unionism.There is a great deal of truth in this - but it’s not the whole truth.The same neglect has continued under politicians wearing green jerseys.It is half a century since unionism held sway in these parts.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wN1xcXC8xOTE1NTE1N1xcXC9PZmZsZWFkLTEtcGljLTEwMjR4NzY4LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjMyN2UwOTU4ZjdmMDJhNzUzYmRkMDJmYWZiY2ZiZTRjNDY2ZjhmZjUifQ==/offlead-1-pic-1024x768.png","title":"rare breed star cahir launches annual agricultural show","story":"A young boy from Dungiven has helped to launch this weekend’s Co Londonderry and Limavady Agricultural Show.Young Cahir McGilligan, who found fame on the recent series of UTV’s Rare Breed, was on hand to launch the show which takes place tomorrow, Saturday, July .Avid farmer Cahir was delighted to be able to help out and is looking forward to participating himself.The annual show, which will be held at Aghanloo, Limavady, will see a number of events taking place throughout the day.These include horse and pony showing and jumping working hunter classes.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshLivestock showingand a fencing competition will also take place.Other attractions include home industries, crafts, vegetables and flowers, fun and games and numerous trade stands and young farmers tug of war.Updates can be found on their Facebook page.Cahir McGilligan is pictured above with the Chairman Mr Alwyn McFarlane and Mr Stanley Warnock who want to encourage everyone to attend the show for a great family day out.  "},{"url":null,"title":"springtown camp monument officially unveiled next month","story":"A monument commemorating the Springtown Camp in Derry will be officially unveiled next month at a ceremony near the entrance to the former site it has been announced.The unveiling will take place on Thursday, August  adjacent to the North West Regional College Training Centre at  noon and will be followed by a Civic reception at the Guildhall at pm.The art installation will take the form of a Nissan hut in which the inhabitants of the camp were forced to live in deplorable conditions because of a policy of housing discrimination in operation at the time against the Catholic community.Springtown Camp was originally a Second World War United States military installation which was vacated after the end of the conflict in the mid-s. Over  families once inhabited Springtown Camp and occupied it around  because of over-crowded living conditions in Derry.The decision to squat in the former military huts, despite the fact there was no electricity, running water or means of heating, came after many families evaluated that these conditions were actually better than they were enduring.The camp became a focal point of the early civil rights agitation in Derry.Willie Deery, who grew up in the camp, said: “This monument is vital because the camp symbolises the precursor to the civil rights marches.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s also somewhat ironic because  years after our mother’s were evicted from the Guildhall for protesting against the conditions at the camp there will now be a civic reception for us there.“This will be a recognition for our parents who had to raise their children in shocking circumstances.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in ..

It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap.

Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

Ballynahinch is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular and we need to see work on the bypass starting as soon as possible, he said.Cllr Walker argued that the current congestion is hampering new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and believes the provision of the new bypass represents a ldquowin win for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down close in on last four  ","story":"DOWN camogs took another step towards qualication for the semi-finals when they blitzed Carlow at Pairc Esler on Saturday afternoon.The home side started in a hurry and stormed into a - to - interval lead, Carlowrsquos only scores coming from two pointed frees.Down were strong in all departments, but they had the star of the show in Portaferryrsquos Niamh Mallon, who helped herself to -, with only three points coming from frees.Mallon received great support from Castlewellanrsquos Sorcha McCartan who helped set Down on their way with a cracking goal in the th minute to put her side - to - clear.Mallon grabbed Downrsquos second goal just after the break and a double from Catherine McGourty was the icing on the cake as the Downmanagement team emptied their bench.The only negative on the day came when Sara Louise Carr had to leave the action in the first half with what appeared to be a calf injury and she must now be a serious doubt for the big game with Derrry on July .Down sit top of their group alongside Tipperary with Derry only a point behind and a win against their Ulster rivals would surely secure a place in the last four.Down -Carlow -ALL-IRELAND ICC.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C July 17%2C 1979  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN mdash Stormont officials were keeping tight-lipped this week about the prospect of finding new employment for  workers who have been dramatically paid off at two textile factories in the Castlewellan area.Redundancy notices went sent out last week to employees of the Moss Lane Spinning Company in Castlewellan and Standard Mills of Annsborough mdash but there is a chance they may be re-employedmoves to attract a new company to the vacated premises are successful.The official receiver, Mr Noel Stewart, who is the man heading the search for a new owner, said the two factories mdash operating as a joint company mdash had been plagued by ldquocatastrophic losses during the last  months.He stressed that he was optimistic that a new owner will be found and said the Department of Commerce had indicated that it will give every assistance to get the factories open again.A spokesman for the Department would only say that efforts were being made to get factories re-opened, but would not state the level of success.ldquoWe are trying to get another company to move into the premises at Castlewellan and Annsborough, but I am not prepared to say more than that at the moment, he said.Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill, slammed the decision to close the factories and said it was a disaster for the area.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted immediate action to cope with the grim unemployment problem facing the people of Castlewellan and Annsborough.ldquoThe overall situation was poor before this dramatic turn of affairs, but the close of these two factories makes the situation disastrous, he said.ldquoThere is now no worthwhile employment opportunity on any reasonable scale in the area. This is a situation which calls for immediate action by all relevant government departments, public bodies and interested parties to encourage, promote and attract new employment to the area, he added.BRYANSFORD mdash On a day when there were ten separate attacks on Post Office property throughout the province, Bryansford Post Office was the target for a terrorist bomb and several post office cables in the area were cut.Last Tuesday the telephone operator received an anonymous callfrom a male at .am warning that a bomb had been planted at the post office.Local police went to the scene where they found that a booby-trap bomb had been left in a waste paper basket outside. An Army technical officer later arrived and the bomb was successfully defused.Around the same time Post Office cables were cut at Dromara Road and Castlewellan Road in Clough.NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastle would be overwhelmed by a wave of crime and vice during the holiday period proved unfounded, with the resort enjoying an ldquoextremely quiet period.The RUC said before the Twelfth holidays began that they would be swamping the provincersquos major holiday resorts, including Newcastle, in a bid to crack down on the growing problems of teenage drinking and drug-taking.Newcastle had no major incidents or arrests, except for four Belfast youths who are helping police with their inquiries into shoplting at the Gt House of Mourne on July .A police spokesman stressed, however, that patrols were stepped up during the holiday period, especially during weekends, chiefly because the population of the resort doubled during the summer months.Police said violence was the most common side effect of teenage drinking and they had asked publicans, off licence owners and hotels to be extra vigilant.The spokesman added that the police determination to crack down could only succeed with the help of the people who sold the drink.KILLYLEAGH mdash The Dunmore Hotel in Killyleagh changed hands over the holiday period and it may also be changing its name. The new owners are Mr Paul Green and his we Nancy, from Killinchy, and they have taken over the hotel from Mr Harry Briggs.The hotel was sold for an undisclosed sum of money, but it is believed to be in six figures. The new owners intend to extend and renovate the hotel, but hope that all work can be carried out without closing down the hotel.The short term plans include adding nine new bedrooms at the rear and extensively renovating the present accommodation.The owners intend to keep the present name for the time being, but they are contemplating reverting to the original name of the hotel, lsquoThe Treesrsquo.STRANGFORD mdash Shore sports proved every bit as popular as the sailing events at Strangford Regatta last week.Hundreds of holidaymakers flocked to the village to watch people of all age groups taking part in a host of events in the hot summer sun.The wide spectrum of events made it a day of fierce competition and fun for competitors and spectators alike and the organisers say they were amazed at the success of the sporting programme.Events included a fancy dress competition, round the houses race, rowing race and races for married men and women. Amusements were also provided for the children.PORTAFERRY mdash The Strangford to Portaferry swim was one of the highlights of Portaferry Gala Week, which began on Sunday and continues through until Saturday.The swim against the current, which is believed to be one of the fastest in Europe, took the most out of all eight competitors, who ranged in age from  to .But for Jacqui McIntyre, of Bangor Swimming Club, the swim proved comparatively easy.

It concludes this Saturday with the final of the talent competition and an open air dance.MOURNES mdash The Mourne Mountains are alive to the sound of music mdash music with a message which is about building bridges across the world.The area was the cockpit for an international roadshow arranged and rehearsed at break-neck speed around camp fires.

Very worried indeed. It knows that Boris Johnson ‘betrayed’ it when he supported Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreementin March, having assured its annual conference in Belfast three months earlier he could never support the ‘vassalage’ document. Key players admit that ‘betrayal comes easy to him’.Johnson, they hope, will still want their  votes when he wins. But he has two other audiences. The , members of the Conservative Party and the few million voters who shted to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. The problem for the DUP is those audiences don’t really care about Northern Ireland, pan-UK unionism, or the DUP. Johnson treats Arlene Foster and Nigel Dodds to his well-rehearsed mantra about personal commitment to the Union, but I’m pretty sure it is outweighed by his commitment to his own ego and prime ministerial ambitions. Keeping the DUP happy is nowhere near as important as keeping his own members and Brexit Party supporters happy..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Which raises another problem for the DUP. A recent opinion poll indicates a substantial majority of Conservative members – the people who ensured Johnson made it to Number  – believe that letting NI go is a price worth paying for Brexit. Other polls over the last two years suggest an equally substantial majority of Brexit supporters across England also believe that letting NI go is a price they’d happily pay. You can see their argument: NI voted Remain it needs subsidised by the UK Exchequer getting rid of it solves the ‘border problem’ and makes Brexit easier.That said, what PM wants to begin their Downing Street tenure by pursuing a strategy which breaks-up the United Kingdom, leaving them PM of a psychologically politically physically diminished area which would be neither the UK nor even Great Britain  An independent Scotland to the north, a united Ireland to the west and the rest of the EU to the south. That’s a lot of new borders and problems to deal with. On March , possibly sensing that a ‘hard’ Brexit was increasingly likely, Nigel Dodds said: “I would stay in the EU and remain, rather than risk Northern Ireland’s position. That’s how strongly I feel about the Union.” With the prospect of Johnson as PM, Arlene Foster ed to the issue a few weeks later in Margaret Thatcher’s former constituency in Finchley: “As leader of the DUP I have made clear that the protection of the Union of the United Kingdom is more important than any other political aspiration or cause which we may be focused on at a particular time. I would not put forward any cause which I believed would result in a weakening of the Union, but we must always be cautious of how we move forward. We should resist the temptation to pitch one region against another. We should resist the temptation to view the relationship between ious parts of our United Kingdom as give or take.”The DUP recognises that Johnson – determined to woo the % of Conservative members who support a ‘hard’ Brexit or no deal while winning back the millions who have drted to the Brexit Party – could be pulled in a direction which threatens Northern Ireland. Conservatives account for less than % of votes in NI and have no elected representatives meaning that Johnson has no ‘selfish, strategic’ interest in the place. If he wants to win a general election he can’t risk a chasm between his policy and the millions of Brexitvoters across England.Jeremy Hunt acknowledged that he and Conservative members were “passionate about our precious Union but frustrated that Brexit had not been achieved”. When asked which issue took priority for him, he replied, “The Union every time.” That response is much closer to the DUP position than Johnson’s but since Hunt isn’t going to be prime minister on Wednesday morning what he thinks doesn’t actually amount to a hill of beans.Leaving the EU need never have been an existential threat to the UK. It became one because of dithering and ision at Westminster and the constant, relentless efforts of those who seemed intent on thwarting it. What that did – as some of us predicted – was play directly into the hands of Johnson and Farage. The DUP didn’t help matters. It put too much trust in the competence and loyalty of Johnson and Rees-Mogg, instead of also working closely with the Irish government and the NI parties representing the Remain majority. There was no point, either, in blaming the Irish government for ‘playing games’ when it looked to both that government and the Remain parties in NI that the DUP prioritised a ‘hard’ Brexit and,necessary, a deteriorating relationship with the Republic.Foster and Dodds – eventhey won’t say it out loud – are well aware of the huge damage that a no-deal exit would do to the constitutional geographical integrity of the United Kingdom as we now know it. They will be spooked by recent chatterabout a referendum in NI to allow voters to make the call on a backstop. Add into that mix possible Westminster-driven changes to abortion and same-sex-marriage legislation here and you can understand why key players in the party are worried.Royal Portrush proved itself as a natural venue for the Open Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\" Anyway, the DUP has a lot of problems. It will have an even bigger problemJohnson – which I think is likely – opts for an election to get the mandate he needs to push his policy through the Commons. Given the febrile nature of politics, particularly in England, who would rule out a majority built around a Johnson Farage coalition  That would be a nightmare for the DUP and unionism and they know it. Here’s the ultimate irony: it is the Conservative and Unionist Party and government which now poses the greatest threat to the Union.

Despite a strong lead, Mr Newman said he was still afraid until the final moments..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “He’s wonderful, he’s brilliant for this club,” he said.“It’s an absolutely huge achievement.”Mr Newman said the friends Lowry had made when starting at the club two decades ago were still his friends now.“Every time he steps in the door here he is treated like God here. It’s as simple as that,” he added.Mr Newman said it would be weeks before the win sinks in and he couldn’t wait for the homecoming.“It’ll be massive, there’s no doubt about it. Whenever it does happen it will be fantastic,” he added.Club manager Ray Molloy described it as “the biggest day ever at Esker Hills”.“We’re just so pleased, we can’t believe it. Shane said he was pinching himself coming up the th fairway, I’m still pinching myself.“It’s so important to a small community and a small golf course, for him to win the biggest golf tournament in the world this year and to win it so easily,” he said.Open victory best birthday present ever, says Shane Lowry’s father Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“And to think Shane came here as a young golfer and learned his skills on the hills of Esker.”Mr Molloy said the small club, had about  members, and dozens had turned out to watch the final stages on a big screen in the club house.“We’re just so proud of him, we cannot believe our luck,” he added.“I get emotional when I think how far here in the small club to produce such a wonderful golfer.”Mr Molloy’s daughter Michelle likened the atmosphere to an All-Ireland football final day.“The jerseys are out, the banners are out, the colours are out,” she said. “There’s great excitement, and there’s great pride in Shane and how far he’s come.”Ms Molloy said Lowry had gone from winning the Irish Open  years ago as an amateur to claiming The Open, “the creme de la creme of the majors”.“It’s really exciting for us... Everyone is behind him. He’s part of the community,” she said. “He’s such a nice guy, it makes you want to support him even more.”Local man Eoin Flanagan, who played a round of golf with the -year old major winner after his Irish open win, said: “It’s huge for Ireland, it’s huge for Offaly. It’s a huge achievement... He’s up there on the world stage and he’s going to be a name in every household.”Andy Hoctor, who plays in the club, said everyone knew Lowry and loved him.As Lowry stepped up to take some of his final shots, Mr Hoctor said: “Everyone is so nervous, you’re nearly afraid to look at it. You couldn’t say enough to explain how great it is.”Bridget Farrell was also among the crowd watching with her two girls.She said: “The atmosphere is just electric, you can really get a sense of the emotion, the excitement, and just the thrill of it all.“It’s just huge, huge excitement, and pride as well that someone from the local area, someone from this club is on the world stage.”try catch  TrendingThe th Open Championship -

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years. Among the Northern Ireland firms making the last in previous years include First Derivatives and Novosco. A total of  firms from Northern Ireland made the list last year, with Belfast-based Repstor the highest-ranking Northern Ireland business at number  in the rankings. Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
