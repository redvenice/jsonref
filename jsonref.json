It is unclear whether Lee has the support of all his fellow Republicans, with Mitch McConnell saying earlier today that he is not a fan of holding up government funding to fight the mandate.“It’s a normal course of events that people are ready to do something new, they’re ready to spend time with their families, they’re ready to sleep more. That’s to be expected in the first 18 months to two years of any White House,” Psaki said.”  “It’s only natural after a couple of years to be ready for something new.” “We’re not going to go for their anti-vaxxing. If you think that’s how we’re going to keep government open, forget that,” she said. Pelosi also said that she doesn’t think Republicans have enough votes to shut down the federal government.  “How do they explain to the public that they’re shutting down government because they don’t want people to get vaccinated?” she said. “This is so silly.” House Republicans have been pushing their counterparts in the Senate to use the government shutdown as a way to push for exactly that, encouraging them to not pass a stopgap measure unless Democrats agree to defund the mandate. Manchin told reporters that while he supports a mandate for people who work on government payroll, he’s “less enthused” about a mandate for private companies.  The House will put the measure to a vote today, leaving it up to the Senate to deal with the impending government shutdown that will occur on Friday at midnight if a stopgap measure is not passed.  Richard Shelby, a Republican senator from Alabama who is the top GOP member of the Senate appropriations committee, seemed optimistic about a potential deal in the Senate, telling reporters this morning: “I’m pleased that we have finally reached an agreement.”  It is still unclear whether all 50 Republican senators have agreed to a stopgap measure. House Republicans have been pressuring their Senate colleagues to use the government shutdown as a bargaining chip against the federal vaccine mandate for large businesses, though Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell indicated he does not support that plan. “Let’s be clear, if there is a shutdown, it will be a Republican, anti-vaccine shutdown,” Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said on the floor this morning.The US and Mexican governments will announce the resumption of the program on Thursday, according to the Washington Post, following its previous suspension by Joe Biden after he became president. It will initially begin in San Diego and in the Texas cities of Laredo, Brownsville and El Paso next week. Biden had called the arrangement inhumane after it was used by Donald Trump’s administration to return more than 60,000 asylum seekers across the border to Mexico, where they were often preyed upon by criminal gangs. Many people were left waiting for months in limbo in Mexico as their fate was determined. In October, Alejandro Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, said that the program “had endemic flaws, imposed unjustifiable human costs, pulled resources and personnel away from other priority efforts, and did not address the root causes of irregular migration”. However, Republican officials in Missouri and Texas sued Biden’s administration in federal court to prevent the scrapping of the return to Mexico policy, claiming that it would place an undue burden on them from incoming migrants. The supreme court ultimately concurred with the states, placing an injunction on the federal government in August which forced it to resume the program. Since then, federal officials have been negotiating with their Mexican counterparts on how the scheme will resume. Trump brought a 60-year lease to the property in 2013 for $200m and now a Miami-based investment firm is hoping to turn the building into another luxury hotel, sans the Trump name. CGI Merchant, the investment firm, has indicated its willing to pay $375m for the lease, netting Trump a profit of over $100m.  Experts say that the price is in-line with what the lease could be worth, though some question whether the investment firm and Hilton Worldwide, which is hoping to turn the building into a Waldorf Astoria, will be able to make a profit from a new hotel in the building.  This is the first time that McConnell has spoken about the proposition from House Republicans.Some reports from as early as this summer say that Harris’ office has been experiencing low morale and poor communication between aides and top officials.  Sanders sent an email to office staff last night about her exit, with Harris’ chief of staff Tina Flournoy saying that Sanders told Harris “a couple of months ago” she would be leaving her post at the end of the year, according to Politico, which first reported her exit.  Sanders has worked with Joe Biden and Harris for over three years, first working on Biden’s presidential campaign. Ashley Etienne, Harris’ chief of communications, announced her departure in November. Two others – Harris’ director of press operation and her deputy director in her communications department – have also told others that they are departing, according to the Washington Post.  Democrats in Congress are rushing today to make a deal with Republicans that would prevent a looming government shutdown. Talks between House Democrats and Republicans stalled yesterday over a stopgap spending bill that would temporarily extend the current level of government funding.  Another potential stalemate popped up on Wednesday when a group of House Republicans encouraged their colleagues in the Senate to use the potential shutdown as a bargaining chip. They are encouraging Senate Republicans to block the stopgap measure unless Democrats agree not to direct money toward enforcing the federal vaccine mandate for large companies. Republican House and Senate leaders have not commented on the proposal.  Here’s what else we’re keeping an eye on today:  Stay tuned for more live updates.

Three further cases were found in Scotland. Officials said the iniduals who had tested positive and their contacts are all isolating. Work is underway to identify any links to travel, although public health sources told the  that community transmission was now “almost certainly” occurring in the UK. The UKHSA has now identified cases of the new variant in the east Midlands, east of England, London, south-east and north-west. None have yet been identified in Wales or Northern Ireland. “It is very likely that we will find more cases over the coming days as we are seeing in other countries globally and as we increase case detection through focused contact tracing,” said Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UKHSA. “That’s why it’s critical that anyone with Covid-19 symptoms isolates and gets a PCR test immediately.”Speaking on ITV’s Peston, the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said: “We should all be trying to enjoy the Christmas ahead of us” but, “for what it’s worth, I don’t think there should be much snogging under the mistletoe.” Experts agree this would be a risky business – and not the only one. “Kissing is likely to pose a risk as you are inevitably in very close contact with each other,” said Catherine Noakes, professor of environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds, and a member of Sage. “However, sharing the same air and interacting together in a poorly ventilated room with multiple people is probably a higher risk because in most events this happens far more frequently than very close contact,” she said. “Inhaling the virus is a key risk, and so taking steps to reduce the number of people in a space and ensure that it is well ventilated are likely to be of greater benefit.” Full story from Nicola Davis here: Covid: is it safe to kiss this Christmas? It’s a risk, say scientists The concerned Minnesota resident was an adult male, had a recent travel history to New York City, and had been fully vaccinated. He developed mild symptoms on 22 November and sought Covid testing on 24 November, the state’s health department said, adding that his symptoms have resolved. It appears to be the United States’s second confirmed Omicron case, after the first was confirmed in California by US officials on Wednesday in a person who recently returned to San Francisco from a trip to South Africa. The Biden administration is urging all eligible Americans to get vaccines and boosters to fight Omicron, which is spreading quickly around the world, and will increase family vaccination sites and expand availability at pharmacies. More than 786,000 people have died from coronavirus in the United States, including 37,000 in November alone.That is compared to 48,374 infections and 171 fatalities in the 24 hours prior. For more live updates from the UK, here is Andrew Sparrow’s Covid live blog: The seven-day average estimate for UK seated diners fell six percentage points in the week to 29 November, reaching the lowest point since 17 May when indoor dining reopened in England, Scotland and Wales. Although the number of people eating out is typically lower at the start of the week, this was the weakest daily figure since July. It comes as hospitality bosses report a wave of cancellations of bookings for Christmas parties and events following the emerging news, late last week, of the Omicron variant just as pub, restaurant and hotel operators were hoping to welcome many customers during the crucial festive season. The snapshot from the ONS largely covers the week to Sunday, meaning only a handful of days since news of Omicron have been assessed so far. Boris Johnson announced measures at the weekend to limit the spread of the Omicron variant, including compulsory face coverings from Tuesday in shops and on public transport in England, though he stopped short of including the hospitality sector. However, businesses fear tougher measures could soon follow. Full story here: Dining out in UK at lowest level since May amid Omicron fears It was the fourth confirmed case of the variant in Spain, but the first proving that Omicron is already circulating in the country. On Wednesday, the north-eastern region of Catalonia said it had detected potential traces of the Omicron coronavirus variant in sewage samples from late November. The person affected in Madrid had received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and had no history of travel or close contact with another person from countries where this variant has been detected, authorities said. The 62-year-old man, who has shown mild symptoms since 29 November, is isolating at home, while his closest contacts are under quarantine, authorities said. The two other cases being investigated also presented only mild symptoms, and had no history of travels to risk countries. Norway’s health minister, Ingvild Kjerkol, says face masks should be worn in public places in Oslo and other municipalities and has said adults should practise social distancing nationwide. Norwegian authorities said earlier that as many as 50 people could have become infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus after a Christmas dinner party in Oslo. The country posted a daily record of 4,052 coronavirus cases on Monday, according to data from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. “Fantastic. Thank you so much,” he said to the nurse, before receiving a badge that said: “I’ve boosted my immunity.” For more on the Covid situation in the UK, please follow the UK live blogPA Media reports that a total of 51.8 new cases for every 100,000 people aged 80 and over were recorded in the week to 28 November, while 66.8 for every 100,000 were recorded for 70- to 79-year-olds. For both age groups they are the lowest rates of new cases since the week to 11 July. It is the fifth week in a row that rates for these groups have fallen. The figures, from the Health Security Agency, may reflect the impact of booster doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, which began to be rolled out to double-jabbed people in the oldest groups from the end of September. Rates have also fallen among all other age groups, including schoolchildren. Among five- to nine-year-olds, 873.8 cases for every 100,000 people were recorded in the latest week, down from 949.8 a week earlier, while the figure for 10- to 19-year-olds has dropped from 830.4 to 758.3. Rates for both these groups had risen in the previous two weeks, which coincided with the return of pupils to school following the half-term holiday. Across England, rates have dropped in all regions except London, where they have risen slightly from 325.9 to 331.3. The south-east has the highest rate, at 517.7 cases for every 100,000 people, while Yorkshire and Humber has the lowest, at 308.9.Vaccination could become mandatory in Germany from February, with tough extra restrictions also applying to people who are unvaccinated, the country’s outgoing chancellor, Angela Merkel, has announced. Merkel, who met Germany’s 16 state leaders on Thursday with her successor, Olaf Scholz, for emergency talks on tougher measures to stem rocketing Covid cases, said the situation was “very serious” and an “act of national solidarity” was required. She said Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, would first vote on the proposed vaccine mandate, with the country’s ethics council due to issue formal guidance by the end of the year, and the rule – if passed – coming into force from February. The move would follow the example of neighbouring Austria, which is planning mandatory vaccinations from February. Greece has also announced mandatory jabs for the over-60s, with unvaccinated people facing fines if they fail to comply. New daily infections in Germany have broken records in recent weeks, with many hospitals operating at or over capacity and forced to send patients elsewhere for treatment. Authorities said 73,209 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours. Merkel’s outgoing government had previously ruled out mandatory vaccination, but the measure has since won broad political backing. “We don’t have enough vaccinated people,” Scholz said after the meeting. “We now know that this has consequences.” Read the full report here: Germany could make Covid vaccination mandatory, says Merkel The government is expected to accept the recommendation. The institute said the vaccinations could start as soon as Finland obtains approved shots.Germany will also impose sweeping nationwide restrictions on social contact for unvaccinated people, in what local media is describing as a “lockdown for the unvaccinated”.  Unvaccinated people will be barred from non-essential shops and events, unless they have recently recovered from Covid. “Culture and leisure nationwide will be open only to those who have been vaccinated or recovered,” Merkel said. Discos and clubs will have to shut if case numbers reach above a certain threshold, the chancellor also announced. The Covid situationwas “very serious”, Merkel warned, with cases at very high levels and vaccine take-up still lower in Germany than in many other European countries.  “We have understood that the situation is very serious and that we want to take further measures in addition to those already taken,” Merkel told a news conference. “To do this, the fourth wave must be broken and this has not yet been achieved,” she said, adding that a nationwide vaccination mandate could take effect from February 2022 after it is debated in the Bundestag and after guidance from Germany’s Ethics Council.  Austria became the first western country to make vaccines mandatory in recent days, while Greece said it would make jabs obligatory for over-60s. Merkel and her successor, Olaf Scholz, met German regional leaders today to agree a path forward for the country. More on this as we get it.Reuters is now reporting that an outbreak of Omicron has been confirmed to have occurred in Oslo, the city’s authorities said on Thursday. One person was confirmed positive for the Omicron variant, following a company Christmas party in the Norwegian capital. “At the moment one person is confirmed as infected with Omicron but more cases are expected,” the city said in a statement. “We are working actively with contact tracing to limit the spread and prevent bigger outbreaks.” Norway detected its first two cases of the new Omicron coronavirus variant on Wednesday. The prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, is expected to hold a news conference later on Thursday.  For more on this please see 10.39am.The estimate could lend weight to preliminary information about the very high transmissibility of Omicron, above that of the Delta variant, which before Omicron was considered the most contagious of the main coronavirus variants. “Based on mathematical modelling conducted by ECDC, there are indications that Omicron could cause over half of all SARS-CoV-2 infections in the EUEEA within the next few months,” the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said in a statement. There is no conclusive evidence about Omicron’s transmissibility so far but the World Health Organization’s lead person on Covid-19, Maria van Kerkhove, said on Wednesday the agency expected to have data on this within days. Europe has so far recorded a few dozen infections of people with the Omicron variant, which was first detected last month. The European Union and European Economic Area (EEA) include the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Earlier on Thursday, the French government’s top scientific adviser Jean-François Delfraissy said that Omicron could take Delta’s place already by the end of January. Clamor is growing among some conservatives for Republican senators to oppose a stopgap funding bill, which would fund the government for the next few weeks, unless Democrats agree to not direct money towards enforcing a vaccine mandate for larger companies in the US. If the disgruntled Republicans, who reportedly include Senator Mike Lee, from Utah, are successful, the government would effectively run out of money on Friday and could be forced to furlough workers and shut down some federal services. The need for vaccine mandates, which have been introduced by Joe Biden, has taken on additional importance as the US braces for the impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant. The plot by the right comes after some Republican states have already sought to diminish mandates, by expanding unemployment benefits for employees who have been fired or quit over the requirement to get the vaccine.

Photograph: Damien EagersPublic health officials will\u0026nbspconsider new restrictions on Thursday as part of an effort to keep Covid-19 under control over the Christmas period.Several officials said they expect the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) will discuss whether to recommend curbs at its meeting on Thursday, given ongoing high levels of infection and the still-unknown impact of the Omicron variant.It is not expected that harsh lockdown-style measures will form a part of discussions, however, with emphasis instead on curbing socialising and reducing crowding in hospitality settings.Such an approach could see capacity limits for indoor hospitality settings advised, restrictions on booking sizes and reduced opening hours, or enhanced use of the Covid cert. Advice on household visits is also likely to be considered.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told his Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting he was “sceptical” that imposing new restrictions was necessary, as the disease was tracking optimistic projections.He pointed out, however, that coronavirus cases remained at a high level and more people would be socialising around Christmas. Mr Varadkar told Nphet on Monday it should develop a contingent set of additional curbs to be deployed if the situation worsened, rather than enforcing new rules now, it is understood.Taoiseach Micheál Martin told his Fianna Fáil party that a combination of “vigilance, reduced socialisation and an accelerated booster campaign” was needed.There are concerns in political circles that harsher restrictions could be recommended by Nphet after last week’s unanticipated measures targeting children’s activities.First caseIt comes as the State confirmed its first case of the Omicron variant, with the US also recording its first incidence.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said Nphet would be meeting on Thursday to consider whether further restrictions were necessary, “mindful of Delta and the uncertainty around the Omicron variant”.“If we could see extensive use of the vaccine pass, whether mandated or voluntary, all of that would give us greater assurance in relation to protection and prevention of transmission,” he said.Nothing should be “inferred” at this stage about further recommendations from Nphet, Dr Holohan added.While cases have slowed and are stable they are at a very high number, Dr Holohan said, and this leaves the country exposed to the results of a potential increase in socialisation around Christmas, as well as the uncertainty around Omicron.Officials are expected to discuss plans to track the spread of the new variant, which are likely to be hampered by a lack of genome sequencing capacity.The National Virus Reference Laboratory had hoped to rely on information from PCR testing to identify Omicron cases. However, its director Dr Cillian de Gascun acknowledged there is a “lack of association” between the information provided by the test and Omicron cases.Only one of the first eight samples identified through PCR testing as potential Omicron cases actually turned out to involve the new variant. Current capacity only allows for 5 per cent of cases to be sequenced.There were backbench calls at both the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parliamentary party meetings for the restoration of the full rates of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which were cut this week, though no commitment on this was offered by senior Coalition figures.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"eu agrees to phase out fossil fuels in 10 year plan","story":"Green Party MEP Grace O’Sullivan, lead negotiator for the European Parliament, during final negotiations on the Eighth Environment Action Programme to 2030, which reached a deal this weekThe EU has agreed a 10-year environmental programme that includes phasing out fossil fuel and other environmentally harmful subsidies.Known as the Eighth Environment Action Programme to 2030 (8EAP), it guides the EU’s priorities on climate and environment action for the next decade – and aligns with the European green deal.Speaking on Thursday after nine hours of final negotiations on the legally binding programme, the European Parliament’s lead negotiator, Green MEP Grace O’Sullivan, welcomed the outcome.As rapporteur in complex trilogue negotiations with the European Commission and European Council, she said her team have worked hard to secure success, backed by a strong mandate from the parliament. This meant environmental law had been strengthened in key areas, notably phasing out fossil fuel and other environmentally harmful subsidies, she said.This would be backed by a binding legislative framework to monitor and report on member states’ progress towards phasing out the subsidies, she confirmed. “A deadline to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, which is consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, will also be set.”The outcome of the Cop26 climate negotiations and the Cop15 bioersity summit “had shown that ending public funding for activities that destroy our planet is finally on the global agenda, and the EU must lead on their phase out by adopting concrete deadlines”, she believed.“The eighth EAP makes a ‘wellbeing economy’ a priority objective for 2030. This is a first in EU law and marks an important step in moving away from the obsessive, unsustainable focus on GDP growth towards what this pandemic has shown us is the most important thing of all the wellbeing of our people and planet.“This is a positive example of the sort of systemic change required to reach our objective of living well, within the limits of our planet,” Ms O’Sullivan said.This sort of progress was critical in the fight to target emissions and address the climate and bioersity emergency the planet was immersed in, she said.Priority objectives of 8EAP include ensuring climate mitigation to attain the 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target of 55 per cent enhanced adaptation measures to counter the inevitable impacts of climate disruption, and “protecting, preserving and restoring bioersity”.They also include pursuing “zero pollution”, especially in relation to harmful chemicals, and significantly reducing “key environmental pressures related to the EU’s material and consumption footprints”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"germany considers mandatory covid vaccinations as new curbs announced","story":"Outgoing German chancellor Angela Merkel and her likely successor, Olaf Scholz at a press conference in Berlin on Thursday. Photograph: Filip SingerEPAGermany has imposed a de facto lockdown on people not vaccinated against Covid-19, limiting their contacts and excluding them from all but essential shops and services in a bid to break a record fourth wave of infections.In her likely last act as chancellor, Angela Merkel framed the measures on Thursday as an “act of national solidarity” and spoke out in favour of a vaccine mandate, echoing her successor, Olaf Scholz.“We have to break the fourth wave,” said Dr Merkel. “You can see from the decisions that we view the situation as very serious.”After a video conference with the country’s 16 federal leaders on Thursday, Germany’s outgoing and incoming chancellors presented common rules for the entire country. Until Christmas, only those vaccinated against or recovered from Covid-19 are permitted into most shops, restaurants, cultural venues and Christmas markets. Unvaccinated people will be allowed meet only two people from another household.Regions with high infection rates will have tighter rules for all: clubs and discos will close, indoor gatherings will be limited to 50 people and sport events limited to maximum 50 per cent capacity. Bavaria has gone further, allowing soccer matches to proceed only without fans.In a push to boost the vaccination rate, still below 70 per cent of the population, Germany is to allow chemists administer the Covid-19 vaccine, ending a monopoly by doctors.‘No red lines’After weeks of debate, Dr Merkel and Mr Scholz have joined a growing consensus to make Covid vaccines compulsory.“We all hoped that a voluntary approach would be better accepted,” she conceded. “We lobbied, on all fronts, for people to get vaccinated but see there is still a gap in vaccinations, meaning vaccinated people face restrictions and that the health system is at the brink of overload.”After days of high-stakes brinkmanship, against a backdrop of record infections and deaths, Mr Scholz insisted that his government – to be sworn in next week – would accept “no red lines” when it came to tackling Covid-19.That was a clear nod to his liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), which resists any kind of new national lockdown.In an interview with Die Zeit weekly, Mr Scholz made a series of digs at his predecessor’s style of leadership, promising a more open style of cabinet and greater co-ordination regarding the pandemic. He has already set up a permanent central crisis committee of experts to meet with him every day in the chancellery.Asked whether such a committee should have been set up two years ago, he answered: “Correct.”“I want to make my own mark,” he added. “This is about acting, not show.”Dr Merkel was given an official send-off on Thursday evening with a “grand tattoo” by Germany’s Bundeswehr armed forces.In keeping with tradition, the army band agreed to play three requests from the departing leader. Her choices were a hit by East German punk singer Nina Hagen (Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen), a chanson by Berlin singer Hildegard Knef (Für mich soll’s rote Rosen regnen) and a Johann Sebastian Bach hymn (Grosser Gott, wir loben dich). \u0026nbspStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Oil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaints"},{"url":null,"title":"travellers to us must undergo covid 19 test within a day of departure","story":"Passengers travelling to the United States from Ireland and elsewhere will have to undergo testing for Covid-19 within one day of their departure under new measures to be introduced by the Biden administration. Photograph: Emmanuel CrosetAFP via Getty ImagesPassengers travelling to the United States from Ireland and elsewhere will have to undergo testing for Covid-19 within one day of their departure under new measures to be introduced by the Biden administration.The US government has said that as part of a strategy for tackling the disease this winter it will, from early next week, tighten pre-departure testing protocols which currently require all passengers to take a test within three days of travelling.It says the stricter testing timeline will provide an added degree of public health protection as scientists continue to assess the Omicron variant. The plan, announced on Thursday, will also see the existing requirement for passengers on aircraft and public transportation to wear masks continue until the middle of March. Fines for non-compliance with the mask requirement are to be increased to a minimum of $500, rising to up to $3,000 for repeat offenders. Mr Biden’s administration also held out the prospect that new Covid-19 treatments which could help prevent hospitalisation and death may be on the horizon in the winter months. It promiseed that if these are approved by regulators they will be available equally to all Americans regardless of income or location.New boostersThe plan also says the government the will seek to accelerate the development and deployment of new vaccines and boosters if they are needed to deal with the Omicron variant. It says health and medical experts believe the current vaccines authorised in the US provide at least some protection against Omicron and that boosters strengthen that protection significantly. However, it says the adminstration wants to be prepared for all scenarios and is is taking steps now to be able to quickly act if updated vaccinations or boosters are needed to respond to the Omicron variant.Apart from significant moves to improve vacaination uptake and testing in the United States, the president’s plan also involves the provision of large quantities of vaccines to poorer countries.DeliverThe plan says the United States has committed to to donating 1.2 billion doses to the world. It says it will deliver 200 million more of these in the next 100 days to poorer countries. It says these doses will be provided for free with no strings attached. It says the United States will also be the first country to negotiate a deal with manufacturer Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and Covax, the global access programme for vaccines, to send them directly to humanitarian settings and conflict zones to vaccinate displaced people. The Biden plan also commits to ramping up vaccine manufacturing capacity globally. It aims to see capacity increased by an additional one billion doses per year with production starting in the second half of next year.It also involves the provision of Covid vaccine boosters for all adults greater vaccination to protect children and keep schools open and the expansion of free at-home testing.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"army deployed help stranded storm arwen","story":"A person has died after being left without heating and electricity because of Storm Arwen. The first named storm of the winter season has battered the UK with 100mph winds and the north of the country has been worst-hit, with fallen trees and snow cutting off communities.One such community was Rothbury in Northumberland, where local councillor Steven Bridgett said: Sadly, we’ve had a death in this area.The person in question did have underlying health conditions but we believe the lack of powerheating may have been a contributing factor.My thoughts really are with the person\u0027s family. I don’t know what to say. I’m gutted.The Army has been called in to help those left stranded by Storm Arwen, with some households having been without heating, power and water for a week.Around 19,500 homes are still without power due to the damage caused by Storm Arwen, Downing Street has said.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said on Thursday that 7,949 homes had had power restored since Wednesday - meaning 98 per cent of the 950,000 homes originally affected now had electricity.We are in hourly contact with network operators to reconnect power, the spokesman said.We are working urgently to ensure welfare and shelter is provided to those households that need it.We still expect the majority of homes to have their power restored by the end of the week.Boris Johnson told broadcasters the authorities were doing everything they could to help those people affected.Every day we are reducing the numbers of people who have the outages but a lot of people have been out of power for a long time, he said.It was a very, very big storm. We are doing everything we can to to help people. There were about 19,000 homes without this morning. We have got that down to about 16,000.That is no consolation for the 16,000 who are still suffering but we are working flat out to help you.Military personnel will be deployed in Aboyne, Alford, Banchory, Banff, Ellon, Fraserburgh, Huntly, Inverurie, Peterhead, Stonehaven, Turriff and Westhill to support the response to the storm. Alex Burnett, a Conservative MSP, tweeted: They will check on vulnerable people in their homes and conduct door-to-door checks. Please do not hesitate to message me or email if you or someone you know needs assistance.A statement from Aberdeenshire Council said: Following a formal approach to the UK Government for assistance, around 120 military personnel will be arriving in Aberdeenshire this morning to support our ongoing resilience efforts in the aftermath of Storm Arwen.The troops will focus on welfare checks on the ground within those communities still impacted by loss of power and will supplement what our own teams have been doing since the weekend.We continue to appreciate all the wonderful examples of community assistance which continue to be evident across the region – whether it be supplies of hot food and drinks, checking on elderly residents and neighbours or helping to deliver supplies.Thank you for all your endeavours and rest assured we continue to work tirelessly to provide the support our communities require at this challenging time.A resident whose home lost power after Storm Arwen has described feeling inconsolable and scared as she faces a sixth night without central heating.Thousands of people have been left without electricity after winds reaching almost 100mph ripped down power lines, uprooted trees and caused debris blockages on roads.Jessica May Teasdale, 35, whose home in Stanley, County Durham, lost power on Friday evening, described the experience as a nightmare and said her region had been abandoned by the Government.Ms Teasdale, an architectural ironmonger, said: It\u0027s a nightmare... we\u0027re inconsolable and scared, are we going to get even more ill to the point where it\u0027s pneumonia?I was in tears this morning, just thinking, \u0027is it ever going to end?\u0027Our health is deteriorating each day because we\u0027re constantly in the cold.It feels like we\u0027ve been forgotten about. I mean, not to be sad but I don\u0027t even want to wake up tomorrow.Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng described the storm as unlike any other, and promised to do everything possible to restore power to homes affected before Christmas.In Parliament, Conservative Richard Holden told MPs including Mr Kwarteng that a rural surgery in his North West Durham constituency had lost £10,000 of flu vaccines when its fridges cut out.He said some remote communities have been warned it could be a very long time before their electricity supply is fully restored.Mr Kwarteng replied: Being without power until Christmas is simply unacceptable, I\u0027ll say that publicly, and I\u0027ll do everything I can to make sure that that doesn\u0027t happen.Clearly, Storm Arwen was an event the likes of which we haven\u0027t seen for certainly 60 years since the record starts.We have to be prepared for similarly extreme, difficult weather conditions in the future. We have to make sure that our system is resilient in that eventuality.He said it was unacceptable that people were left waiting up to two hours to get through to a power cut emergency phone number over the weekend.Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron said at least 7,000 homes in his Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency have been without power for between three and five nights and feel forgotten.Some have been told they will be without power for another week, and he urged the Government to send in the Army to help.Mary Kelly Foy, Labour MP for Durham City, said the power outages are a national scandal.Welfare centres and hot food have been provided, with energy network companies working with local resilience forums, emergency services, local authorities and the British Red Cross.Engineers from across the UK have been sent to the worst-affected areas.Energy minister Greg Hands visited Weardale, County Durham, on Wednesday and met Northern Powergrid engineers to thank them for their efforts.He said about 3,000 homes in the St John\u0027s Chapel area had lost power, which should be down to the few hundreds by Wednesday night.The minister was also expected to visit Northern Powergrid\u0027s Newcastle call centre, his department said.Mr Kwarteng has previously warned that weather events like Storm Arwen could become more frequent due to climate change.Be informed - via email - about the latest news stories as soon as they break. Click here to sign up to  Breaking News Alerts.More from NewsIt’s not the public who need to pull their weight over the obesity crisisAstrazeneca Covid vaccine Q\u0026ampA: What we know about blood clots, its trigger, the side effects and risksYou have a right to elect a racist or misogynist, says former Tory ministerKamala Harris suffers new setback as second senior aide in a month quitsRoyal College of Midwives apologises after guidance refers to mothers as ‘postnatal people’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"educated young wealthy thousands hong kongers looking move uk","story":"Hong Kongers applying to come to Britain are younger, wealthier and more educated than those planning to remain, an Oxford University study has found.Nearly 90,000 have applied for British visas to escape Chinese rule and are expected to hit 100,000 in the New Year, equivalent to a town the size of Gillingham.The study, by Oxford University’s Migration Observatory, exposing the brain drain\u0027\u0027 from the former British colony found they were predominantly young Hong Kongers, with half born in the 1980s or 1990s.Compared to those who plan to stay in Hong Kong, potential UK movers were also more likely to have university education (33 per cent versus 22 per cent).They were more likely to be in full-time employment (60 per cent against 50 per cent) and 90 per cent had at least A-level or post-secondary education.Dr Peter William Walsh, a researcher at the Migration Observatory, said the UK’s visa scheme appeared to be more attractive to those with the funds and younger Hong Kongers with fewer ties to it.“The BN(O) route to the UK has already generated significant numbers of applications, but it’s not a particularly cheap option. For a family of three to use this route to get citizenship in the UK would take at least five years and cost about £20,000,”  he said.The system, which offers up to 5.4 million Hong Kongers a five-year visa and a path to permanent British citizenship, was opened on January 31 after China’s new security laws were introduced last year.Home Office figures show that 88,000 Hong Kongers have applied for Britain’s bespoke five year visa scheme in the 10 months since it was launched.The survey, the first major study into Hong Kong migration, found that the UK was the preferred option among those who expressed an interest in leaving the country.A third (33 per cent) placed it as  their top destination, ahead of second-place Taiwan (23 per cent), Australia (15per cent) and Canada (11 per cent). London was the most common choice of destination city, favoured by 42 per cent of potential movers and well ahead of second-place Manchester (12 per cent). The survey also found that dissatisfaction with a wide range of political, social and economic factors in Hong Kong was much higher among potential UK movers than those who planned to stay behind. More than half (52 per cent)  of potential UK movers were dissatisfied with the credibility of the police and the trustworthiness of the government (57 per cent). Half (53 per cent) were also dissatisfied with economic factors such as the cost of living in Hong Kong although 63 per cent also said they expected to face a pay cut if they moved to the UK, suggesting better wages were not a primary driver of decisions.Many also cited prospects for their children as a factor motivating a preference for the UK.More from NewsIt’s not the public who need to pull their weight over the obesity crisisAstrazeneca Covid vaccine Q\u0026ampA: What we know about blood clots, its trigger, the side effects and risksYou have a right to elect a racist or misogynist, says former Tory ministerKamala Harris suffers new setback as second senior aide in a month quitsRoyal College of Midwives apologises after guidance refers to mothers as ‘postnatal people’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron covid cases likely three times official figure scientist","story":"Omicron cases in England are likely to already be triple the official number, a science adviser to the Government has warned.Analysis by Dr Nicholas Davies, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), suggests there were around 60 cases already in England by November 28, yet only 22 have been reported by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).The data, provided to the LSHTM by NHS Test and Trace, show the number of samples that are likely to be omicron has risen from around 0.1 per cent to 0.3 per cent in five days.The figures are based on infections picked up by positive Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. About half of labs in England use a type of PCR test that can give an early indication that the infection is omicron.The test looks for three gene targets found in coronavirus, but in omicron, the virus has mutated so much that one of the targets is missing, known as s-gene target failure (SGTF).Dr Davies, who is a member of SPI-M, said on social media: “Given that omicron causes SGTF, while the otherwise globally dominant delta variant doesn\u0027t, these \u0027excess\u0027 SGTFs are most likely omicron cases, at least some of which have yet to be confirmed via sequencing.“Incidentally, these SGTF cases are concentrated in similar areas of England to the omicron cases that have been confirmed so far.“It\u0027s not a perfect signal. Some rare lineages carry SGTF without being a new variant, and SGTF can sometimes occur just because the viral concentration on a swab is low. So in the plot above, the low level of SGTF between August and mid-November is just background noise.“But in the last five days (24 – 28 Nov), the level of SGTF has gone up from its usual 0.1 per cent to around 0.3 per cent. These are not huge numbers of cases — this represents about 60 more SGTF cases than we would expect to see in these data given the background prevalence of around 0.1 per cent.”Previously, experts have voiced their concerns that NHS Test and Trace will miss many cases of the variant, because only around half of cases are ever found and just one fifth of those will be fully sequenced.Although Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said that SGTF would be used to indicate omicron, the new figures suggest that many cases are being missed.The UKHSA said it was developing a rapid new genotyping test to allow local labs test specifically for omicron without the need for full sequencing, but could not say how widely it would be rolled out, or when it would be available.Full sequencing can take up to 48 hours, so if samples must be sent away to be checked, it is possible that people will not know they need to self-isolate in time.However, although cases are rising in South Africa, which experts suspect is being driven by omicron, in Botswana cases are falling, even though cases were detected there from mid-November.Nine cases of omicron were identified in England on Wednesday, taking the total in the country to 22. The variant has now been found in the East Midlands, East of England, London, South East and North West.A further case was also reported in Scotland, bringing the total to 10.More from NewsIt’s not the public who need to pull their weight over the obesity crisisAstrazeneca Covid vaccine Q\u0026ampA: What we know about blood clots, its trigger, the side effects and risksYou have a right to elect a racist or misogynist, says former Tory ministerKamala Harris suffers new setback as second senior aide in a month quitsRoyal College of Midwives apologises after guidance refers to mothers as ‘postnatal people’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal college midwives apologises guidance refers mothers postnatal","story":"The Royal College of Midwives referred to mothers as “postnatal people” in new guidance before issuing an apology hours later for “erasing” women.The RCM published “safer sleep” guidance for those sharing a bed with their newborns and for helping them get to sleep.  However, the guidance, published on Wednesday evening, makes no reference to “women” or “mothers”, instead referring to “postnatal people”. The publication sparked a backlash on social media, and by Thursday morning it had been removed from its website.The guidance described key areas which healthcare professionals should discuss with families during pregnancy and following birth. Referring to sleeping arrangements, it said: “Postnatal people in hospital should have easy access to the call bell system, be shown how to use it and ensure it is working - they should be provided with a bed-side cot for the baby to use while in hospital.”The RCM, whose chief executive is Gill Walton, is a member of the embattled Stonewall Diversity Champion Programme, a paid-for scheme which advises and assesses on creating inclusive workplaces and aims to help firms “become more inclusive of LGBT people”.It released a statement apologising for omitting women from the guidance, stating: “We would like to apologise that women are not mentioned in our recent safer sleeping guidance. However, following the RCM’s u-turn, the freelance journalist, who claims she was “cancelled” for her views on birth, said it was “really important to support the RCM” because “in this highly sensitive area it is very difficult to publicly admit you have made a mistake”. “There may be questions to ask about howwhy etc but in my view today should simply be about 100 per cent support for them,” she said.Maya Forstater, a women who lost her job after saying that people cannot change their biological sex and who went on to win a landmark appeal against an employment tribunal, also replied to the RCM’s statement on Twitter, saying: “Thank you!”The BBC recently said it would leave the Stonewall Diversity Champion Programme because its participation had raised questions about whether it could be impartial on issues which the LGBTQ+ charity is campaigning on.Other organisations including Channel 4, Ofcom, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Cabinet Office have also made similar decisions.Freddy McConnell, a trans man and journalist, lost a years-long legal battle to be registered as his first child’s “dad” or “parent” on their birth certificate. He is now pregnant with his second child and plans to travel to Sweden to give birth so he can be legally recognised as his baby’s father.Responding to the backlash, Mr McConnell said: “It’s a shame when self-styled birth activists use social-media moments like this to further their exclusionary agendas, rather than focusing on approaches that keep all babies, birthing mothers and people, and their co-parents, safe.”More from NewsIt’s not the public who need to pull their weight over the obesity crisisAstrazeneca Covid vaccine Q\u0026ampA: What we know about blood clots, its trigger, the side effects and risksYou have a right to elect a racist or misogynist, says former Tory ministerKamala Harris suffers new setback as second senior aide in a month quitsCustomer isn\u0026#39t always right as manager who stood up to aggressive shopper wins unfair dismissal claimMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pigs hernias as big footballs","story":"Exclusive: Pigs with hernias as big as footballs in squalid farm for frankfurters sold in UKWARNING, DISTRESSING CONTENT: Footage secretly filmed in a farm supplying Frankfurter brand Herta found pigs being beaten and mutiliated - the brand is owned by Nestlé and Spanish food firm Casa Tarradellas and stocked in Asda, Iceland, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco Image: French group L and UK group Open CagesByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | commentsPigs reared by a Frankfurter company sold in major British supermarkets are left to suffer with hernias “as big as footballs” in squalid conditions, as well as being beaten and mutilated, an investigation has found. The brand promises “higher animal welfare standards” but videos secretly filmed inside a farm which supplies Herta, reveals multiple breaches of animal welfare standards, according to L the French campaign group that obtained the footage. It shows pigs being beaten and mutilated and according to L also pumped full of antibiotics considered “last resort” by the World Health Organisation. The farm is contracted to supply Frankfurter brand Herta which is % owned by Nestlé and stocked in Asda, Iceland, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco. Spanish food firm Casa Tarradellas owns the remaining %.The footage, obtained in north-eastern France in August and September, also show animals living on concrete floors appearing to be covered with faeces, sows in cages so small they cannot turn around, and sick or injured animals with hernias that appear to be as big as footballs.The pigs in the video have had their tails docked, a practice outlawed in the EU, other than in exceptional circumstances.  No straw or other bedding is seen and the sheds do not appear to have any natural light. L say they filmed male piglets castrated without anesthetics by tearing of the tissue: a painful technique which is forbidden. Some sows in the video are also beaten, which is prohibited, while some who are pregnant were filmed in cages which do not appear to have permanent access to water, in violation of the law.  Other violations of EU regulations the group say they have uncovered include weak piglets, considered to have poor economical potential, appearing to be slammed on the floor in the footage. The group says this killing practice does not comply with the EU rules of emergency slaughter. On its website, Herta claims that their “Filiere Preference” guarantees “a modern scheme, more respectful of the environment and of animal welfare.  All our suppliers are committed beside us to improve farming conditions.” The new revelations come after Waitrose pulled all Herta products last year following another exposé revealing ‘deplorable’ conditions at a dferent French farm supplying the brand. A trial is set to take place next month after the farm was accused of animal abuse. British charity Open Cages is campaigning for the introduction of explicit animal welfare labelling, including specically pointing out imports from countries where regulations are lower than UK standards. Open Cages CEO Connor Jackson urged British supermarkets to drop Herta products from its shelves. “This is the second time that footage has revealed the depravity hiding behind Herta’s promises of high welfare” he claimed. “The deception is passed onto the British consumer who is buying meat from animals who have been beaten, tormented and pumped full of antibiotics without knowing it.” “Clearly, Herta is not committed to aposimprove farming conditionsapos as they claim. Waitrose did the right thing by dropping Herta from its shelves, and we are urging Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Asda to do the same immediately or risk continued support of animal cruelty.”A spokesperson for Nestlé UK and on behalf of Hertasaid: “We do not tolerate animal welfare abuses anywhere in our supply chain.The scenes shown in this video are unacceptable. We have contacted Herta to ask them to investigate this farm as a matter of urgency and take the necessary action as needed.” An Asda spokesperson said: ‘’We take animal welfare extremely seriously and as soon as we were made aware of these claims we launched an investigation with the supplier.’’ A Sainsbury’s spokesperson added: “Animal welfare is extremely important to us and we’re investigating with Herta.” Iceland declined to comment.

Voters are going to the polls today in the by-election with the result expected in the early hours of Friday. The constituency was created in  and has always been won by the Tories. Former Conservative PM Ted Heath held the seat - and its predecessor, Bexley - for  years. The last time Labour won here was a  by-election.  Local councillor Mr Francis, , said the route to victory “is a dficult path”, adding: “It does rely on Tories staying at home, some Tories voting for us, Tories voting for other parties, people who might support smaller parties voting Labour. “We accept it’s a dficult path, but it is possible.” The by-election was triggered by the death from cancer of former Cabinet Minister James Brokenshire in October. Mr Francis, a dad of eight-year old twin girls, decided to launch his bid to oust the Conservatives from this South East London stronghold on the Kent border after being persuaded by we Emma, a teacher, and parents at the school gates.“Iaposm standing because I had a broad consensus of Labour Party members plus Conservative and Liberal Democrat voters at my daughters’ school gates encouraging me to stand, saying, ‘If you do, we will vote Labour’.“Those conversations made me believe I could bring together a cross-section of people who normally wouldnapost vote Labour, along with those who do vote Labour.  “Those people at the school gates have been natural Conservatives but theyaposre really not happy with what is happening with public services and believe that I was the person that could be arguing for the right direction in Parliament.” Anger at the Government ranges from the failure to tackle rising gas and food prices to Tory sleaze. “People have been talking about bread and butter issues - cost of living, high streets, policing, cuts the Conservative council has made,” said Mr Francis. “But during the course of the campaign, people’s perceptions have changed about the Prime Minister and about the sleaze that has been surrounding this Government.” While realistic about their chances of winning the seat, Labour canvassers have been buoyed by doorstep reactions. Some traditional Conservatives have volunteered they will not back the party’s candidate Louie French - blaming the Prime Minister.  Mr Francis added: “People have looked at the performance of both the main party leaders and seen who they believe is competent and in control of events and concluded that isn’t the Prime Minister, and that under Keir’s leadership they want to look at the Labour Party again and give us another chance.”Tories who defend Mr Johnson point to his electoral successes - twice winning the London mayoralty, leading the Brexit campaign and steering the Tories to their -seat majority at the  general election.But Mr Francis believes the magic has worn off - and Peppa Pig may have played a role. The PM was widely mocked for talking about the cartoon character during a speech to business leaders last month.“When Boris Johnson was the Mayor of London here, he had a very large personal vote and popular appeal,” said Mr Francis. “But one of the key issues people cite as the main reason they are defecting to Labour is the Peppa Pig speech.” He added: “The Prime Minister has clearly become unpopular here and is being cited as a liability. “I’ve had someone who was a Conservative member until last year tell me he had left the party and was voting Labour in disgust.” Labour insiders concede it will probably not be enough to beat the Tories, but they are confident of cutting the Conservative majority. Mr Francis hopes voters will flock to Labour - boosting the party’s hopes nationally. Fuelling hopes Mr Starmer’s leadership will revive Labouraposs fortunes, he cited the midpoint of Tory PM John Major’s reign, when voters were turning to Labour.  “I’ve been in the Labour Party since , I first knocked a door when John Smith was leader,” he said. “I think people are looking at us in a similar vein to that period in our history, that we are beginning a path after a period when we did have a dficult time, of moving back to the people and electability.”Asked about Jeremy Corbyn ’s ongoing influence on voters, he said: “Some people still have that period in their memories, some people feel we have moved on. “Clearly we will see what the result is on Thursday, but there will be a path that some people need a longer time to look back at that period in our history and think that we have changed. “But they are seeing on a number of issues how the party is moving on. “We are moving back to the centre ground and to where the main thrust of the British people are.” What are voters saying Voters on Bexley High Street today made clear their unease with the Tories - and some pledged their support for Labour, while others had advice for Keir Starmer.But they all expected the Conservatives to win on Thursday. Eva Seeley, , a retired estate agent, said: “I’m going to be voting Labour. I have always voted Labour and I’m not very happy with the Government at the moment - I think Boris isn’t doing a very good job.  “Keir Starmer is doing OK. He’s a bright man but he needs a bit more charisma. “I don’t think Labour will win but they might cut the majority.” Susan Berry, , a retired hospitality manager for Lehman Brothers, said: “I will stick with what I always stick with - the Conservatives. “I’m not % happy with the Conservative Party at the moment, but I won’t vote for the alternative.“Labour don’t say anything positive about what they would do - solutions instead of criticisms. “I think Boris has had a bit of a rough ride, myself.” Ashley Johnson, , a plumber, said: “I didn’t know the by-election was taking place.  “I don’t really follow politics but I know a bit about Boris - I don’t think he’s really the best. “He’s more for the rich class. For the working and middle class people, he doesnapost really help them. “I would probably vote Labour, but I would like to know more about Keir Starmer. “I reckon he should help out the people who are working class - not tax them so much, bring living costs down, rent and things like that. “That’s how to help normal people.” John Bowerman, , a pensioner, said: “I’m voting Labour, I always do - but it’s a waste of time.  “The Tories - they could put up a pig in lipstick and they would win here.” Sarah Spencer, , a finance manager, said: “I haven’t seen anything from the Lib Dems through the door - so much Conservative stuff! “If there’s a Lib Dem then definitely I’m voting for them - I’ve always been a Lib Dem supporter, I just wish there was more activity from them in the area, they need to be more vocal.  “Unfortunately, it’s a Conservative borough and has been for a long time.

That appears to suggest Brits could be offered a fourth dose, given the supply would be more than enough to do so. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the buy-up will ensure we can protect even more people in the years ahead and future proof the Great British vaccination effort.And the head of Pfizer today said annual vaccinations are likely. Dr Albert Bourla told the BBC : Based on everything I have seen so far, I would say that annual vaccinations... are likely to be needed to maintain a very robust and very high level of protection. The government said the deals include  million extra doses of the Moderna vaccine and  million more Pfizer BioNTech doses. That is top of million Pfizer doses due in the second half of next year, and  million Novavax and . million GSK Sanofi doses expected in . It means the UK government has now secured early access to .million vaccine doses from six firms. The UK has still not completed its pledge to give million doses to poorer nations by mid-, including sub-Saharan Africa where the Omicron iant appeared.  Minister George Freeman defended the buy-up, telling Sky News “it’s a balance and adding: The British public would expect us to make sure we’re providing the supply in the UK. But Prof Andrew Pollard of the Oxford Vaccine Group said: As we approach the moment when  billion doses of COVID- vaccines will have been administered worldwide, it is scandalous that such a small proportion have been administered in low-income countries. Pfizer boss Dr Bourla also backed the idea of vaccinating children aged  to , telling the BBC: Covid in schools is thriving. This is disturbing, signicantly, the educational system, and there are kids that will have severe symptoms. So there is no doubt in my mind that the benefits, completely, are in favour of doing it. Boris Johnson has imposed new restrictions to buy time for scientists to establish whether the Omicron iant is able to evade existing vaccines.The strain, which was first detected in South Africa and has spread to the UK and a number of countries, is believed to be more infectious than the dominant Delta iant. Masks are now mandatory again in shops and on public transport, with all international arrivals told to take a PCR test and isolate until they get a negative results. Contacts of Omicron cases will be forced to isolate for  days - regardless of their vaccination status. All eligible adults in the UK will also be offered a booster jab by the end of January to boost immunity levels, the PM has pledged.But Mr Johnsonaposs new target - which also sees the minimum gap from second dose to booster slashed to three months - will force NHS chiefs to signicantly speed up the programme.Roughly . million people have had a second dose so far, while .million have had a booster. This leaves some . million people in need of a booster by the end of January. Mr Javid said: Thanks to the Vaccines Taskforce, we have an excellent track record of securing the vaccines the country needs to keep this virus at bay. “These new deals will future proof the Great British vaccination effort – which has so far delivered more than  million first, second and booster jabs across the UK – and will ensure we can protect even more people in the years ahead. “This is a national mission and our best weapon to deal with this virus and its iants is to get jabs in arms – so when you are called forward, get the jab and get boosted.” People are being urged to wait until they are contacted to get their booster as the NHS calls in the army and volunteers to speed up the rollout. Previously only the over-s and people with certain health conditions were being offered a third dose - but the rollout has now been expanded to all over-s. The priority list will move down in five-year age bands. NHS England is due to write to vaccination centres to ask them to invite all over-s by December , according to The Times. The Prime Minister, , is expected to get his own booster jab on Thursday. Labour leader Keir Starmer, , is expected to receive his booster jab next week.His spokesman said the party chief has also been using lateral flow tests multiple times a week.

Heres what the guidance says, and what MPs have added on topBoris Johnson switching on the Christmas lights in Downing Street Image: Tayfun Salci ZUMA Press Wire REX ShutterstockByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Dec | commentsYet again, you’d be forgiven for being confused about Covid rules. With the Omicron iant on the rise, the government imposed new laws on face masks and travel testing in England. But that then triggered a wave of ‘freelancing’ advice from ministers and a top official that wasn’t government policy. No has been forced to deny the Cabinet are at loggerheads amid the flurry of conflicting comments.Officially, the government’s Covid advice in England is as follows.It’s a legal requirement to wear a face maskin shops, public transport, banks and hair salons. It’s also a legal requirement for all arrivals in the UK to get a Day  PCR test and isolate until it is negative. And it’s a legal requirement to isolate for  daysyou’re a close contact of a suspected Omicron case - evenyou’re vaccinated. However, it’s not a legal requirement to cut down on gatherings or close contact, work from home, or reduce travel. Masks also aren’t a legal requirement in hospitality venues. Guidance - which is voluntary - “strongly recommends” that people wear a mask “in crowded and enclosed spaces, where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.” Guidance also says people “may wish to take a rapid lateral flow test” for Covid in certain situations. These include on days when they’ll be “spending time in crowded and enclosed spaces, or before visiting people who are at higher risk of severe illnessthey get COVID-.” So with that out the way, what on earth have Tory ministers - and an advisor to the government - been saying  We take you through it.‘Don’t snog under the mistletoe, much’ Cabinet minister Therese Coffey said Brits should refrain from smooching strangers at Christmas. I donapost think there should be much snogging under the mistletoe,” the Work and Pensions Secretary told ITVaposs Robert Peston. Donapost need to do things like that. But I think we should all be trying to enjoy the Christmas ahead of us and thataposs why weaposre working so hard to get the deployment of as many vaccines as possible, and of course continuing to encourage people who havenapost been vaccinated at all yet, to come forward, recognising that weaposre still trying to understand the impact of Omicron.” Askedthere should be “just no snogging ”, she replied: Well, not with people you donapost already know! No said of Ms Coffey’s comments: “It is down to iniduals to use their personal judgement”. ‘Companies may cancel big Christmas parties’ Science Minister George Freeman turned into Mr Freelance when he appeared to contradict his own boss and No. He said: “For many small businesses, four or five staff working together every day anyway, gathering to have a drink isn’t a big step up in risk. “But some companies might normally bring hundreds of people around the world to a big party. “And they may decide this year ‘is that sensible ’, given the pandemic and given where we are.” Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman responded: “On Christmas parties, we don’t want people to cancel such events.“There is no government guidance to that end.  “It’s right that post Step Four weto the position were people can use their inidual judgement.” Meanwhile Mr Freeman said the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy would not be having a “big” festive bash. But his words came weeks after the Secretary of State Kwasi Kwarteng said a party was already booked. A Business Department source said “dferent teams do dferent things” and no single party for BEIS had been planned.‘Maybe take a lateral flow test, I might wear a mask’ Health Secretary Sajid Javid tracked close to the official guidance - but that only went to show how vague it is.He said there wasn’t “any need to change” Covid rules, but said he’d take a lateral flow test before going to a Christmas party. If you are invited to a Christmas party, thereaposs quite a few people there, maybe you want to take an LFT before you go,” he said. Go to the party, but just be cautious. Askedhe’d wear a mask at the party he replied: “Maybe. “It dependsI’m walking around or sitting down - it depends. If I’m eating. People just need to make a decision based on the guidance.” Mr Javid backed the Prime Minister, urging people to “follow the existing guidance and be sensible about that.” The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: I think he was very clear about what he was saying. He was setting out that we do have a signicant testing capacity, andpeople wanted further reassurance they could use that.‘Go to nativity plays - but obviously wear a mask’Care Minister Gillian Keegan encouraged parents to attend school events - but added they should “obviously” follow non-mandatory guidance. Asked about nativity plays, she replied: “I think we’ve said go about your plans. “I mean, obviously wear a mask, be cautious, you know, all the things that people usually put in place, to be honest. “I think most people have been sensible all along, but we’re not saying to people cancel your plans and I’m sure it would be lovely to go to a nativity play right now.” AskedChristmas would be “ruined”, Ms Keegan replied: “Hopefully not”.‘Try not socialising when you don’t need to’Dr Jenny Harries is the odd one out in this list as she’s a non-political scientic advisor to the government, not a Tory minister. But the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agencytriggered the whole row earlier this week with her comments. She said working from home could be a “key” element of controlling a possible surge in future - despite No resisting the measure. She also said “not socialising when we donapost particularly need to” over Christmas could keep the virus at bay. She told the BBC : Weaposve seen that not everybody has gone back to work and Iaposd like to think of it more in a general way.Which iswe all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the iant at bay. So I think being careful, not socialising when we donapost particularly need to and particularly going and getting those booster jabs which, of course, people will now be able to have at a three-month interval from their primary course. Boris Johnson directly rejected the advice, adding: “On Christmas parties and nativity plays, we don’t want people to cancel such events.”‘We’re not in Plan B yet and don’t cancel anything’Lastly we come to Boris Johnson, who despite enacting mask laws has insisted we’re still not in his Plan B for winter. He has insisted people should not cancel anything and only need to follow the guidance. Despite saying “what Jenny’s saying there is right”, he directly rejected her advice. Askedhe agreed with her he said: “The answer is no.” The PM added: “We’re not going to change the overall guidance, we don’t think that’s necessary. We don’t see anything to suggest that we need to go for instance to Plan B, but what we do need to do is take particular precautions against Omicron until we’ve worked out exactly what kind of a threat it may present.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonCabinetBBCConservative PartyPoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ms Rayner wanted to knowhe would be conducting an internal investigation into the use of Government property for the parties and the role played by Boris Johnson and his officials. The Labour deputy leader wrote: You will no doubt understand the seriousness of the allegations made. This Government is undermining public health messaging with their actions and we cannot let this go on unchecked. It cannot be that the Prime Minister believes there to be a set of rules for the public and a totally dferent set of rules for himself. Mr Johnson and his Downing Street staff have been accused of breaking Covid rules by attending parties at Number  in the run-up to last Christmas. The Prime Minister gave a speech at a packed leaving do for a top aide last November when the country was in the grip of its second lockdown. Then just days before Christmas, with London in tier  restrictions, members of his top team held their own festive bash in Downing Street. It is alleged that officials knocked back glasses of wine during a yuletide quiz and a Secret Santa while the rest of the country was forced to stay at home. The following day the PM aposcancelledapos Christmas for millions of people across the country.Mr Johnson refused three times to deny that the boozy parties had taken place when pressed at PMQs.  No  has claimed that Covid rules were followed at all times. But a Downing Street insider claimed there were often evening get-togethers while millions of people were observing the strict curbs imposed by the PM. The source said: “It was the only place you could get together and socialise. They happened most Fridays.” The Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice group slammed the PM, who faced demands to apologise for what appears to be a clear breach of his own rules. Member Safiah Ngah lost her father Zahari, , to the virus in February. The -year-old said: “Last Christmas is sadly one I will never forget. “One in  people in my borough had Covid- and my family were desperately trying to do what we could to keep each other safe. Unfortunately it wasn’t enough. To think that just a few miles away, Boris Johnson was throwing a ‘Christmas party’, with no care for the rules he had set, is sickening.“In September, he looked bereaved families in the eye and told them he had done ‘everything he could to keep their loved ones safe’. How exactly did breaking the rules himself fit into that  “While he was enjoying an illegal Christmas party, the people he should have been protecting were dying all around the country.” “The first thing the Prime Minister must do is acknowledge the hurt this has caused, and apologise.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour Partypolitan PolicePoliticsCoronavirusBoris Johnson\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We were at the theatre, to see a show my son had been learning about at school, a super special early Christmas treat.Behind us were five women in their thirties who, from the off, talked, and not even in stage ­whispers only during the big musical numbers. They chatted at the top of their voices throughout, as though they were at home in front of the telly rather than surrounded by people, and being incredibly rude to the performers on stage a few feet away. Half-way through the second act, I snapped. Although that makes it sound much more impressive than it was, because obviously I just meekly and incredibly Britishly pleaded with them to be quiet. Please. Thank you. Sorry. It did not go well. I was stupid for trying. What did I think they were going to say, “We had no idea we were disturbing you, please accept our apologies ”  Of course not. They knew they were being loud. They didn’t care. It reminded me of whenever I’ve seen anybody ask someone to wear a mask. The last time, it ended with the personanswering the polite, reasonable request with, “You f***king bitch, mind your own business”.The irony of saying that about a global pandemic – by definition, everyone’s business – seemingly lost here.Now there’s a potentially serious new iant, so we’re being asked to do something. The something that a worldwide study found to be the single most effective public health measure at tackling Covid. Wear a mask.  The reaction to this small ask, and my uncomfortable theatre experience, has left me with a depressing realisation. We’re not living in a Me First society. We’re living in a Me Me Me Me First society. This was impossible to ignore thanks to the amount of maskless people going about their business on Monday – in shops, on public transport , everywhere. They knew the mandate was coming into effect the following day, and why, but still they refused to take part in the communal effort to save Christmas – and, you know, lives – until there was no other option. Admittedly the messaging has been insane over the last few months. There will be some who think you must not need to wear a maskthe man with the most important job in the UK doesn’t. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. But there are others who know this isn’t the case, but don’t want to wear masks, so they just… don’t. Similar to the kind of person who feels like chatting loudly in a theatre, so just… does. Apart from no one diespeople talk in a theatre. The truth is that there are a lot of utterly selfish iniduals out there. We see it on a larger scale with rich countries not doing enough to supply vaccines to poorer ones because they’re too worried about themselves. And what gets lost is that helping them is the best thing we can dowe’re worried about ourselves, becauseeveryone’s vaccinated, spread is reduced and iants less likely to develop. We all need to look out for each other, with masks, with sharing vaccines, with compassion. Only then is there hope for us all.

The pharmaceutical giant’s chief executive Dr Albert Bourla said the virus is “thriving” in schools and “there is no doubt in my mind that the benefits, completely, are in favour of doing it”. It comes as the UK’s vaccine watchdog prepares official advice on whether to offer jabs to kids aged  to . Currently those aged  and over are offered it. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationsaid this week: “No vaccine is currently authorised in the UK for use in children aged  to  years. “JCVI will continue to review data on the potential benefits and risks of vaccination of children aged  to  years and will issue separate advice in due course.” JCVI member Prof Adam Finn warned the “balance” of whether to vaccinate kids was “still quite uncertain”. He told BBC Breakfast the main benefit of immunising children is the indirect protection of adults.He added: The extent to which we can do that and protect adults by avoiding them being infected by children with the current vaccines is still quite uncertain. So, thataposs the balance - we clearly want to protect children as much as possible and weaposve got good evidence now that this vaccine, even at a low dose, produces a really good protective immune response in children and produces many fewer side effects because of the lower dose. The question really is that should that be our focus right now. “Or should we really be focusing on adults who are the ones that much more commonly get seriously ill.  The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved the Pfizer jab for younger children. The boss of Pfizer said immunising that age group in the UK and Europe would be a good idea.

Minister George Freeman weighed in after the French President privately hit out at the straw-haired Prime Minster and his “Johnson circus”. According to the magazine Le Canard Enchaine, Mr Macron claimed his counterpart had “the attitude of a vulgarian”. He said: “BoJo talks to me at full speed, everything is going fine, we have discussions like big people, and then he gives us a hard time before or afterwards in an inelegant way. “It’s always the same circus.” Mr Macron is reported to have added: “It is sad to see a major country with which we could do huge numbers of things, led by a clown.”  Science minister Mr Freeman told Sky News: “I think we’re into pantomime season aren’t we, and there’s a French election coming. “It’s a pretty unhelpful word. “Of course the Prime Minister isn’t a clown, he’s the elected Prime Minister of this country with a very big mandate, leading this country through the pandemic.” He insisted: “I’m confident Anglo-French relations are better than that quote suggests.” Downing Street has not commented on the comments, which have not been officially confirmed by the Elysee Palace. But last night a UK government source suggested things will only improve after the French Presidential election in April - which could oust Mr Macron. The source said: The Prime Minister continues to be a staunch advocate for the strength of the UK-French relationship.“Our approach will not change, evenwe have to wait until the other side of the French Presidential election for a change of tone.”Relations between London and Paris have been in the deep freezefor months over post-Brexitfishing rightsand Channel crossings. The situation worsened after Mr Johnson published onTwittera letter he had written to the French leader, demanding action to crackdown on illegal Channel crossings.On Wednesday night a Cabinet minister said she was surprised and disappointed at reports of the French President’s words.Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told ITV ’s Peston: “I’m surprised to hear that. “I’m conscious that we have a shared mission in trying to make sure that the people smuggling gangs are really brought to justice.” When it was put to her that the development was troubling, Ms Coffey added: As I say, Iaposm surprised to hear that and disappointed, openly. Iaposm sure that we can continue to try and work together to tackle this. “But the Prime Minister wrote to the President last week and... I hope that weaposll get a formal response back. People smugglers, they donapost carepeople live or die. They just want their money. And weaposve got to try and work this through, not only between our two shores, but actually tackling this in the first place. And Iaposve got confidence that Priti [Patel] is trying to make those inroads right across not just Europe, but also in our more international communications as well.

Downing Street did not rule out bringing back pre-travel tests before the end of the year as the Government monitors the spread of the new Omicron iant. Boris Johnson has announced a package of new Covid measures to buy time for scientists who are racing to understand the threat of the new strain.Since am on Tuesday, all internationals arrivals are required to take a PCR test and isolate until they get their result. But a leaked paper from the Governmentaposs SAGE advisors said pre-departure tests would be valuable, adding that the current plan would identy signicantly fewer cases thanpeople were asked to take tests on day  or .  Askedpre-departure tests were on the agenda, Science Minister George Freeman told the Today programme: Weaposre looking at all the data and Omicron is, weaposre literally live work every day on looking at the data, both internationally and domestically. He added: We are watching the data very closely and we will update the guidance as required. Asked to rule out bringing in pre-departure tests before Christmas, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: “I think what I can say is at the moment we have this three week review point… we believe restrictions we’ve put in place … strike the right balance between protecting lives and livelihoods. There are no plans to introduce pre-departure tests, we think the Day  test is the right way.  The spokesman added: It’s not a restriction we’re planning to introduce based on what we currently know.But Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: It is totally unacceptable that ministers are failing to take action at the border when even their own advisors are telling them to introduce pre-departure tests.“It cannot be right that people can travel to an airport, board a busy flight, queue at busy departure gates, and travel on trains and buses in the UK, all without having taken a test. “The government must not repeat the mistakes it made earlier in the pandemic by being too slow to take action to prevent further cases of the Omicron iant entering the UK.” The Scottish and Welsh Governments have issued a joint call for ato tests on day  after people arrive back in the UK.

Adorable Harper Foy, six, has harlequin ichthyosis , which makes her skin grow  times faster than normal - meaning she has to have four showers every day to soothe it. The schoolgirl from Washington is thought to be one of only  people in the USA living with her condition - and for the first few years of her le, her parents were worried she wouldnapost ever go to school at all. However, Harperaposs mum Angie, , said so far, her brave daughter hasnapost let the condition hold her back. “There are other people with her condition that we’re aware of who are home schooled, so the fact that Harper has been able to start kindergarten this September is a miracle for us.”For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Harlequin ichthyosis causes the skin to grow  times faster than normal, making it thick, dry and severely scaly. At birth, it requires intensive care. One of the only things that can soothe her angry skin is a shower - so Harper has to spend around four hours under the water every single day. Since starting her first year of school this autumn, Harper has had to have an hour long shower before heading into class. Then at lunchtime, sheaposs picked up for a pitstop to have a second shower.When she gets home from school, she has her third shower of the day, before a final shower at bedtime.Angie said: “The showers are an inconvenience, but they are essential for Harper to be able to go about her day.  “Because her skin sheds so much, it becomes itchy and sore, so the showers alleviate a lot of that discomfort. Angie and her husband Kevin, , were concerned their daughteraposs condition might stop her making friends at school because she has to come home at lunchtime. But luckily, their outgoing daughter hasnapost let anything stop her. She said: “She has lots of friends at school and they are all very conscious of her condition and help hershe needs it. “Kids are so resilient, and Harper is no dferent.”Although things are likely to get more complicated with Harperaposs schooling as she gets older, Angie hopes her daughter will be able to stay in school up to her teenage years.Angie, who lives with her husband, Kevin, , a project manager, and their three children, Harper, Sam, , and Jaxon, , said: I’m not sure how it’s going to work as Harper gets older, she said.The schoolwork will naturally get more dficult, so it will be harder for her to miss things tohome for a shower.“But we will figure that out when we reach that point. With her attitude, I’m sure Harper will achieve anything she puts her mind to.”Itaposs been a big year for Harper, who lives with her parents and brothers Jaxon and Sam.Sheaposs been scouted as a child model after charming an agency with her sharp sense of humour. Her mum gushed: You can’t help but love her when you meet her. Sheaposs got this unmatched personality, this sense of fun.“She was signed up to a two-year contract with a modelling agency just before the pandemic but, unfortunately, that meant there weren’t any jobs coming in.“Now that the world is starting toto normal, she’s just shot her first modelling campaign.Although Angie has to remain tight-lipped about the nature of her daughteraposs campaign, she hopes Harper will be able to see her face on billboards one day. Due to Harper’s condition, she did not have her hair and make-up done like models usually do, but Angie says she still felt very much part of things on the day of the shoot.“Her skin and scalp are too sensitive to get her hair and make-up done, but they had music blasting and Harper was dancing around the room, said Angie. “She loves Ed Sheeran, so they were playing his music for her too. Harper loves dancing and music. I always say she is an old soul.“The commercial will come out early next year and she is so excited about seeing herself in it.”Angie says her daughter has come a long way since she was born, and is now thriving. She said: “The early days were spent doing a lot of research on her condition and hearing dferent things from doctors on what course of treatment they were going to offer next.  “It was a very scary and uncertain time for us and now, to be out the other side, feels like a dream.“Harper will always be dferent from other people and her skin will always need special care and attention, but we will cross each bridge as we get to it.“I used to worry a lot about how the world would treat a girl like Harper, with her condition.

The code phrase is part of the Ask Angela campaign aimed at helping people who feel unsafe, vulnerable or threatened in bars, clubs and other night time venues, Liverpool Echo reports. Anyone who feels this way, can approach bar or security staff using the special code word Angela, which indicates to staff that they require help or support.This might be in the form of calling them a taxi, reuniting them with a friend or calling security and or the police. Adam Potter has been asked the question several times since he started his job as doorman in Liverpool city centre five months ago. The -year-old said every night at work he is approached by women who ask him to keep an eye on men who are making them feel uncomfortable on the dancefloor. And when Adam has been asked by women is Angela in tonight , he says he has stepped in to help.  Adam told the Liverpool Echo: They basically say aposcan you keep an eye on this guy heaposs making me feel uncomfortable apos I probably get that at least once a night, possibly three or four times a night - thataposs just girls who come up to me. They might say aposheaposs tapped me on the bottomapos, in which case he gets thrown out. Any touching inappropriately they get thrown out immediately. Adam has spoken out in the hope of raising awareness of the Ask Angela campaign and encouraging other bar staff to learn about the initiative. It comes after a post was shared widely on social media about the importance of the campaign in keeping people safe on nights out. Adam said: What happens is,a girl comes up to you and says aposIs Angela in tonight apos you know exactly what she means. What you then do is say aposyes apossheaposs in tonight just come with me.apos You take her behind the bar into the staff area and phone for a taxi. In more extreme cases, bar staff might have to call the police or security. Adam said: I went into this job basically just to help people and I do my very best but when I hear about girls constantly being harassed and not being as safe as they used to be going out it makes me feel upset.

Cordelle Scotland, , had to take time off following an operation to treat her endometriosis and was told by her boss to try and swap her shts. Cordelle, who worked at Heathrow Airport as a customer services representative, complained after failing her probationary period and was told she had been sacked as she had been late to work several times. A tribunal ruled the airline treated her unfavourably by criticising Cordelle for not swapping shts. The airline was ordered she be paid £, compensation for injury to her feelings.  Cordelle suffered from fibroids and endometriosis, which causes excessive bleeding, a hearing was told. Having worked for BA for eight months and had her probationary period extended due to concern over absences and lateness, she told bosses she needed to undergo surgery for the condition. The tribunal heard Cordelle sent an email in November  explaining: I am due for hospital admission on th December for an abdominal myomectomy due to my fibroids and endometriosis reaching the stage of disability which in turn affects my work and le in general greatly.To put it into perspective, my uterus is the same size as a five and a half month pregnancy due to the tumours.The recovery period is about  weeks however I have concerns as to how this may affect my probation. I need to have this surgery on this date as I have been having treatment for the last three months to help shrink the fibroids before surgery and it is not recommended for me to continue the treatment any longer than three months as it has induced me into menopause which can trigger osteoporosis. My third and last treatment will be on the th November. As a result, she was signed off by her GP for two weeks from December . When her probationary period ended in February , Cordelle was told her employment would be terminated as your attendance level is unacceptable and you have been late to work on  separate occasions between March  and February . In an email, Heathrow Services Manager Nicola Drinkwater added: I have taken into account that you had a planned medical procedure on the th December , which you have been recovering from and signed off work by your GP between th December  - nd February .  However the seasonal roster you were working offers vast amounts of flexibility to swap shts and work on available rest days prior or post your procedure. She also cited a further three occasions of lateness which came after a review meeting in October  that extended Cordelleaposs probationary period due to concerns regarding your attendance and performance. Cordelle then emailed CEO Alex Cruz and Tom Stevens, BAaposs Head of Worldwide Airports, and said she made all attempts to ensure my surgery would not interfere with my employment. She added: For Nikki to then make the statement that I should have sorted my recovery time off with sht swaps and leave is completely unfair and discriminatory. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.My surgery was gynaecological for endometriosisand uterine fibroids . Why should I be expected to have covered recovery time from major surgery with leave and sht swap. Ms Drinkwater told the tribunal Cordelle was sacked for the high number of times she was late and that it was not because of her sickness absence nor the need to be on restricted duties following herto work. Cordelleaposs claims for wrongful dismissal, direct discrimination because of race and or sex and or disability were dismissed by the tribunal. It also ruled that BA failed to make reasonable adjustments for her disability. The tribunal further ruled that BA had treated her unfavourably under the Equality Act by considering her absence for the operation when terminating her contract and in criticising her for not swapping shts. In his ruling, Employment Judge Oliver Hyams stated: Ms Drinkwater plainly did take into account in making her decision the fact that [Miss Scotland] had had some absences from work on account of sickness which was the result of having endometriosis, which [BA] accepted was a disability. Ms Drinkwater did that by criticising [Miss Scotland] for not swapping shts with the result that she did not, as far as Ms Drinkwater was concerned, exhibit what Ms Drinkwater would have regarded as a commendable spirit. That treatment of [Miss Scotland], ie that criticism, was made only as a result of her being unable to work because of the surgery which had been required to mitigate the effects of her disability.

Alicia Murphy, , and her husband, Guy, moved into their home in West Derby, Liverpool, in September  with their rescue dog, Otis, after thinking the property ladder was out of reach for them.It wasnapost until the pair spoke to a mortgage adviser that they realised they could be eligible for a % deposit option, Liverpool Echo reported.Alicia, who is from Liverpool originally said: I loved that it had character in the form of period features, I loved the location and it was pretty much a clean slate decor wise, which meant we could put our own spin on it. I think it had been a rental property before the owner decided to sell it on, so it was very much beige walls, light floors, etc. The couple paid just under £, for the home with a £, deposit and said their monthly cost of living was around £ including their mortgage and bills. Once they moved in to the property Alicia began experimenting with dferent colours and decoration options to make everything their own aposoriginal styleapos. But the -year-old admitted she didnapost have an initial vision for the property. She said: Originally we’d only planned to paint the walls green and have a green sofa, and it wasn’t until we moved in and I started experimenting with decorating, colour schemes and interior styles that I realised I totally loved everything ‘maximalist’ and quirky. Social media has been amazing for providing inspiration and ideas. Instagram is one of the main s I use - not only can you see other people’s amazing homes and styling, but you can also follow along with tutorials and DIYs and actually try them out for yourself. I also use Pinterest a lot.Six months after moving into the Liverpool home, Alicia set up her own blog and Instagram account to keep people updated with her progress and to share ideas with others.The Emerald Terrace Instagram now has .k followers.Alicia said: I’d wanted to start a blog for years and just wasn’t sure what my niche could be. To tell you the truth, I was never too interested in interiors before moving into this house. I set up the account about six months after moving in - a few people said I should try it because my home was that little bit dferent, and it just grew from there really! Hundreds of people comment on the Emerald Terrace Instagram updates to ask Alicia questions and compliment her home. One commenter said: You’ve NAILED the luxury hotel bathroom vibe. Another added: Forever wishing I could copy and paste your perfect perfect home for myself! Looking ahead, the couple said they expect to move on in the future but can see themselves living in West Derby for a few more years yet. The -year-old said: I think we’ll definitely move on in the future as it’d be great to have some more space, but that won’t be for a few years now. I’ve already had people jokingly tell me they’ll be the first to buy itI ever come to sell!

The six-year-old was living with his paternal grandparents, who “loved and cherished him”, when the pandemic hit. But his dad Thomas Hughes decided to move in with girlfriend Emma Tustin when the country was plunged into lockdown.Today his evil stepmum convicted of murdering the defenceless child after a horric campaign of abuse, while his dad was found guilty of manslaughter.Det Insp Laura Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said it “was the worst decision that could have been made”. “If only Hughes had left Arthur with his grandparents who absolutely doted on him, loved him and cherished him,” she told the Mirror. “The manipulation and the toxic relationship between Tustin and Hughes meant the family were cut out of Arthur’s le and didnapost play a part. “The lockdown meant professionals didn’t have the opportunity to monitor him in the same way they would do with children normally. “I do think that lockdown contributed. “The professionals who would ordinarily have been involved in Arthur’s le, such as teachers, weren’t having that contact with him and spotting changes in his behaviour or bruises on his body. “Tustin and Hughes cut off family members so Arthur was no longer seeing or speaking to him. “And when social workers went out to Tustin’s home there was an absolute manipulation of them by the defendants. “It was the only day when Arthur was allowed to play in the garden and he presented very dferently as a result. “When the professionals did speak to him they weren’t picking up on the signs they would have donehe had been segregated in a hallway. “Tustin and Hughes pulled the wood over the eyes of the professionals. They didn’t want children’s services involved.” Specialist grief counsellors were drafted in to help police left traumatised by Arthur’s death. Veteran detectives were left in tears as they watched CCTV footage of the helpless youngster alone in his family home. They also discovered harrowing evidence that Arthur had been sadistically poisoned with salt by his dad and step-mum. DI Harrison described it as the “most traumatic” case she had ever investigated.  She compared his death to the murder of Daniel Pelka, the tragic four-year-old boy killed by his mum and step-dad in . In both cases the children were deliberately poisoned with salt to increase the suffering before their deaths. “I knew when we started it was a horric case, but there have been moments that have just completely got me,” she said. “Everyone involved has found it really haunting having to witness and experience the evil and horric torture that Arthur was subjected to. “There are real similarities with Daniel Pelka, definitely in terms of salt poisoning. “I’d not heard of it before in child cruelty cases and it’s been really hard to comprehend. But it is a haunting parallel. “A physical assault is one thing - but it’s very devious and manipulative to dose a child up with salt. It’s another level of evil. “It could only have been done as another way to control Arthur - an extra punishment. “We think maybe they did it to make him more thirsty but we don’t know because they’ve never given us an explanation.  “It’s been really dficult for the officers who have to sit for hours watching CCTV footage of Arthur being isolated. “I arranged for a trauma counsellor to come in to explain the emotions people might be experiencing and to teach coping mechanisms they could put in place. “They have been able to independently see the counsellor without the rest of the team knowing. “We don’t ordinarily get faced with CCTV like this. “The footage really got to the heart of what Arthur was being subjected to and thataposs why it’s been so hard-hitting and dferent to similar cases. “When you add in the  recordings of Arthur in distress and the brutal text messages, it sets it apart from the Pelka and Baby P cases. “We’ve been reliant on medical expert opinion and it’s been crucial. “But the actual emotional element of this case has been proved by that CCTV or hearing audio clips where he is calling out for family members, calling out for food or water, and that nobody loves him. “We all know children in our lives. You just cannot comprehend anybody being able to neglect a child over such a sustained period of time. “It was not a sudden loss of control, it was a well thought-out campaign of abuse, both physically and psychologically, towards Arthur.” DI Harrison said it was “hard to comprehend” how Hughes and Tustin tried to blame Arthur for his fatal injuries. She said: “They’ve blamed each other and they’ve blamed Arthur as well. “How can a six-year-old boy be responsible for what happened  We know he couldn’t have inflicted his fatal injuries himself. “They are both equally responsible. Although Tustin killed Arthur, Hughes encouraged the killing by actions.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON West Midlands PoliceCCTVCCTV footageCrimeMurderPolice\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The children are currently not in school due to concerns over covid and Toby’s type  diabetes condition.\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _RGP_MDM_Morris_.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" The Morris family in Somerset - Charlie Morris with children Finley,  , Toby, and Phoebe,  at their home in Whitchurch, Bristol Image: Rowan Grfiths   Daily MirrorByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnistClaire Donnelly:,  Dec | commentsSarah Brooks has chronic ­rheumatoid arthritis. Like many people on immunosuppressant drugs, she is double-vaccinated but hasn’t developed any ­antibodies to Covid-. Her four-year-old daughter, Ella, has a rare type of epilepsy that can be ­triggered by a virus or a fever. With Covid rates rising, and the new Omicron iant gaining ground, Mrs Brooks has taken the decision to home school her three children. But – under current government rules – now faces being fined. “We were invited for a meeting with the attendance officer and were told we face fines and or prosecution,” says Mrs Brooks . “On the same day we got a letter saying that the school itself was at the centre of a Covid outbreak. It’s bonkers.” The family have now got in touch with the Good Law Project, who have sent a pre-action letter to the local council challenging the decision to enforce attendance. Getting “back to normal” has left millions of clinically vulnerable people behind. At one time .million were official “shielders”. One in four of them have never stopped according to ONS figures. Now they are just people who can’t go out, but have no extra support. Last week, the number of pupils absent from school in England because of Covid rose by about %. Some , state-school pupils were absent with confirmed or suspected cases on November .  Rather than recognising the dilemma faced by vulnerable families, the Secretary of State for Education, Nadhim Zahawi, has doubled down on the Government’s position with a letter to school leaders about “maximising” school attendance. “We are at a crucial point in the pandemic and must collectively act now to ensure lower levels of attendance do not become the accepted norm,” the letter says. “I hope you agree on the urgency.” For the Morris family in Somerset, the letter was devastating. Toby Morris, aged , has had Type  Diabetes since he was a baby. His sister, Phoebe, seven, is a brittle diabetic who needs round-the-clock monitoring. “Because the Government is saying no one has to shield and children should attend as normal, we’re stuck in this nightmare,” their dad Charlie,, explains. “The bubbles, isolating, all the things schools were doing to keep children safe, it’s all gone out of the window. “There are thousands of families like ours put in a position where schools are saying they can’t authorise any absence because it’s meant to now be attendance as normal – but because there are vulnerable people in our family that isn’t safe for us. “School is important – I’m a former teacher. But an education is no goodyou’re dead or suffering a chronic illness as a result of a nasty infection. Our son’s already suffered enough living with a le-long, le-limiting condition.”The family are also being supported by the Good Law Project after they say their local MP, Jacob Rees-Mogg, failed to reply to them.This week, the Government ­introduced masks into communal areas in schools, but stopped short of further mitigations like increasing ventilation, classroom bubbles, masks in classrooms and further access to vaccinations for children. Many Year  children won’t turn  until long after winter. Even then, the vaccination programme for children is grindingly slow. Nadhim Zahawi recently met with Miriam Cates, a Tory MP and education committee member who believes “Covid isn’t a risk to children”. Andrew Lewer MP tweeted “Miriam Cates MP  I met with @nadhimzahawi about face masks in schools  our aspiration to phase them out.” Cates is well-known for her ­opposition to mask wearing because “showing our faces is part of being human”. She has also called for an end to the regular testing of schoolchildren without symptoms, and says there is “no rush” for vaccines in schools. For Ella Brooks, at home in the Midlands, catching Covid could be a death sentence. Her rare form of epilepsy means she suffers intense seizures particularly when she has a fever. These can start in her sleep and cause her to stop breathing. “Once again we are behind Wales and Scotland in terms of mitigations being adopted, despite Covid currently running rampant through most schools in England,” her mum says. “The message seems to be ‘attendance at all costs’ – but for us, that cost could be someone’s le.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The best place for young people is in the classroom, it is vital for their education and mental health which is a priority. “All children should be supported to continue to attend school and our guidance to schools about attendance of clinically vulnerable children has been clear throughout. In line with guidance every child aged  and over with specic underlying health conditions has been offered the vaccine.” No one wants ato lockdown home schooling. And yet failing to use masks alongside mitigations like ventilation will likely end in soaring cases. Yesterday, Gwynedd in North Wales, announced ato online learning after a spike in cases. More councils may soon be following suit. “There’s this  argument that you’re pro-freedom or pro-lockdown but it’s not that simple,” Sarah Morris says. “We don’t want lockdown and we want schools to stay open, but we need them to be made safer and at the moment, for families like ours, they’re not. As parents it’s really stressful.” For her the choice comes down to one thing. “I’ve sat at my daughter’s bedside, watched her struggling. Her condition can be le-threatening and I have to do what I can to prevent that.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Tory GovernmentJacob Rees-MoggNadhim ZahawiEducationSchoolsMental healthArthritisPoliticsEpilepsyCoronavirusCoronavirus lockdown\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The incredibly rare time capsule, that is now worth £,, was the first to leave the production line in September . The show car toured for , miles across the country and was used by the carmakers to advertise their state-of-the-art creation. But after its star-studded first years, the Aston passed into private hands and was put in storage in  where it was left to fall apart. The Vantage was forgotten about until  when it was bought by classic car enthusiast John Cook at an auction.  He spent a whopping £, on an extensive restoration project, ing the car to its factory condition with Fiesta red paintwork and black leather interior. It even includes original copies of magazine reviews, its parts catalogue, instruction book, owner logbook, and test certicates. Charles Ramsey, owner of Classic Connection in Burley, Hants, where the car has ben consigned for sale, said it was the ‘rarest DB in existence’.  He said: “The most impressive thing about this car is that it was the first DB Vantage - and only the third DB - ever to leave the production line. “It was used as a factory demonstration for advertisements and magazine reviews making it very rare to a collector. “The car has been fully restored to its original Fiesta red and all its specications compared to others of its kind which were often changed.  “The history file includes magazine reviews of the car, its owner logbook, instruction book, and factory build sheets. “It’s a blessing this piece of Aston Martin history was discovered after lying dormant and restored to such a remarkable degree”. Mr Cook handed the motor over to Aston Services Dorset, the officially-appointed restorers of vintage Astons, for the restoration project. Only , DBs were made at the Aston Martin factory in Newport Pagnell, Bucks, between  and . The Vantage iant came out in  but only  models were made. The Vantages, which offered a more powerful performance, were even more exclusive. They had a .-litre straight six-cylinder engine that could deliver bhp compared bhp that standard DBs had. Mr Cook, , who is also from Burley, said: “Cars from this period often got to the stage where their value dropped and owners forgot about them which seems to have been the case with this one. “When I bought it, it was in a serious state of disrepair and I gave it to Aston Services Dorset to undergo a £, restoration. “It is such a special car which is so perfect and I want to give it to someone  to enjoy. “I’ve got another project in mind so I needed to clear the decks to get myself ready for it. “I have a real passion for finding old things and bringing them back to how they originally were.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Aston MartinCars\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Illustrations released by the Genomics UK Consortiumshow that it has a worrying  mutations on its spike protein. By comparison Delta - which tore through the population last winter and has since become the worldaposs dominant strain - has seven. Experts have said Omicron, which was first identied by scientists in South Africa, is the most mutated Covid iant they have yet encountered. This morning a spokesman for the UK Health Security Agency told The Mirror that targeted testing is being carried out for the iant.  This means that not every positive PCR test is screened for the new strain.At the weekend Boris Johnson announced a range of measures aimed at halting Omicronaposs spread, including compulsory PCR testing for all travellers arriving in the UK from abroad.  Contacts of those identied as having the strain are also required to isolate for  days, regardless of whether they have vaccinated. Officials say it is too early to tell how worried we should be about the iant, with Brits urged to show caution.  The strain has been classied as of concern by the World Health Organisation . It is feared that Omicron could prove resistant to vaccines because of the number of mutations in its spike protein. This affects how it responds to antibodies in the immune system, and the way it enters human cells. This week South African Raquel Viana, Head of Science at one of South Africaaposs biggest private testing labs, said she had a sinking feeling when she discovered the new strain while genetically testing positive swabs in the country.  She told Reuters: I was quite shocked at what I was seeing. I questioned whether something had gone wrong in the process.Early indications show most Omicroncoronavirus cases are mild, the World Health Organisation has said. The official believes there is no evidence to suggest the efficacy of vaccines reduces when battling against the new iant.The organisation, quoted by Reuters, suggested most cases so far examined are not severe. They cautiously added there is still a lot not yet known about the new strain.

However a damp cold home is not only extremely unpleasant, it can also be very bad for your health. Government data has found that in the two years to March , % of all homes in the UK had damp in one room or more while between % and % are thought to have black mould.Damp and mould appear when there is excess moisture in the home, which can be caused by anything from leaking pipes and rising damp on ground floors to leaking ceilings and poor ventilation. How does mould in the house affect my health  Damp in the home can have a array of negative health effects, causing respiratory infections, asthma and allergies. It produces a number of substances that disagree with the human body, including irritants, allergens and, on occasion, toxic substances. If you inhale or touch mould it can lead to allergic reactions including sneezing, a runny nose, skin rashes and red eyes. In more severe cases it can directly lead to asthma attacks. It affects some worse than others with babies, children, the elderly all more sensitive to it.It can also affect people with pre-existing medical conditions that are made worse by its presence. They include people with skin conditions like eczema, respiratory problems like asthma and allergies or those with a weakened immune system like someone undergoing chemotherapy.How to safely get rid of mould from your homeAccording to homeserve, getting rid of mould on walls can be achieved using a number of dferent chemicals including baking soda, white distilled vinegar or % concentration of hydrogen peroxide. They should be applied to the area and left for a time before being scrubbed.It is crucial you find you where the excess moisture is coming from - once you know the source you can begin to take steps to mitigate the effects or solve the issue completely. Getting this done may sometimes need professional help, although smaller amounts can be done yourself. If your home is newly built yet still damp it could be that the water used in its construction, like in wall plaster, is still drying out. How do you stop mould growing in your home  Homeserve suggest a number of top tips for preventing mould from taking hold, they say: Open windows every day to let fresh air in and moisture out Close the door of the room you’re ventilating to keep the rest of the house warm and prevent moisture escaping to other parts Open a window or use an extractor fan when showering, cooking or using a tumble dryer When you’re not showering or cooking, leave internal doors open to let air flow freely around your house Dry any washing outside when possible If you do dry washing inside, open a window and close the door of the room it’s hanging in If you have window vents, leave them open permanently Use a dehumidier and moisture traps on windowsills to remove damp from the air Dry any condensation from windows and windowsills Clear out roof gutters regularly to avoid water overflowing onto your walls Check roof tiles and fascia boards and repair any leaks or rotting wood Check that your damp-proof course is above the ground level of your home Fix plumbing leaks quickly and dry the area.

Weaposre free to party, toke the occasional cig, sleep with whoever we want to, and nurse our hangovers with fast food and sleep. But for many young gay men, including myself, the fear surrounding HIV and Aids can be crippling - evenweaposre not exposing ourselves to potential infection. In the aposs, the Aids crisis, also known as the aposgay plagueapos, had the world in a panicked chokehold. It was seen as a stark death sentence, a self-inflicted consequence of a dirty lestyle a decade of tragedy. And while medical understanding has advanced by leaps and bounds - the stigma surrounding the virus still echoed on to younger generations.I was six years old when Section  was finally abolished in England and Wales. The notorious law, brought in during Thatcheraposs administration, prohibited schools from talking about homosexuality. But a decade later, at the ripe old age of , I still hadnapost received any form of LGBTQ+ sex education at secondary school or sixth form. I didnapost know that HIV was no longer the death sentence that it once was, or what aposundetectableapos meant, or why as a teen who hadnapost even had sex I was so afraid of it. Because I really was petried at times.  At school, youaposd regularly hear jokes about people being bummed and getting Aids - but no teacher attempted to correct the ignorance or debunk the myths. And for some reason, I couldnapost talk to anyone about my constant panic of dying - because the stigma surrounding the virus is still re, and education is still so poor.  In fact, according to sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust, the most recent estimate suggests there were , people living with HIV in the UK in . Of these, around , are undiagnosed and do not know they are HIV positive. Equally alarming,  percent of people living with HIV have never shared their status with anyone outside of their healthcare workers. Now, my experience with health anxiety is nothing compared to the thousands of people living with HIV who face discrimination on a daily basis. But it highlights how strong the reverberations of the aposs crisis are - and how important it is we begin to educate children about HIV. Today is World Aids Day - but headlines surrounding Covid continue to dominate. Perhaps because Aids is still seen as a gay comeuppance that doesnapost really affect the straight world - or maybe because the stigma is so ingrained into our society itaposs impossible to smash. But we must break through. If not, history could easily repeat itself.HIV is the name of a virus. Aids is the name for a collection of illnesses caused by this virus. HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. ‘Immunodeficiency’ refers to the weakening of the immune system by the virus. HIV has been passed on between humans for many decades but was only identied in the early s.AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. It is a collection of illnessescaused by a virus people pick upthat makes their immune system weak . You can’t get an AIDS diagnosis unless you’re already HIV positive. In the s and early s, most people with HIV were eventually diagnosed with AIDS. Now, thanks to modern antiretroviral treatment, very few people in the UK develop serious HIV-related illnesses. The term Aids isn’t used much by UK doctors. Instead they talk about late-stage or advanced HIV. If left untreated, infection with HIV progresses through a series of stages: from flu-like seroconversion illness, through infections associated with the symptomatic stage, leading to late-stage HIV or AIDS. If someone with HIV has a detectable viral load, they can pass on HIV through blood, semen, vaginal fluid, anal mucus and breast milk. HIV is not passed on by spitting, sneezing or coughing, nor by kissing or general social contact. HIV can’t survive for very long once itaposs outside the human body. Studies have shown that a person whoaposs on effective treatment who has an undetectable viral load canapost pass on HIV.

Suffering from concussion and a cut nose she was rushed to hospital in an ambulance where she was treated by concerned medical staff. But Cindy’s fall was not an accident at all. Instead she was suffering from factitious disorder - also known as Munchausen’s syndrome - and had collapsed on purpose. The condition, which sees someone pretend to be ill, or actively try to make themselves ill, in order to receive care, sympathy and attention, has been a lelong affliction for Cindy. She remembers faking flu when she was four and today at  still falls to deliberately hurt herself. “One time I swallowed a whole tin of Tiger Balm, because camphor is known to cause seizures and I wanted to induce one,” she admits. “I’ve probably given myself about  concussions over the years and I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve been in ambulances. I face plant and don’t put my hands out to protect myself, so I land head first on the concrete. I do it in public places like a supermarket, a bus stop or a busy street. “It’s about receiving attention and tenderness. When I’m being lted into an ambulance there is that feeling of being carried and of being loved and looked after – I feel comforted and peaceful it’s a very powerful feeling. If someone didn’t treat me with tenderness I didn’t bother doing it around them anymore. So it was unfortunate that the people who were kindest to me got the brunt of my bad behaviour.” It’s a condition that is currently being highlighted on screen in Coronation Street. Medical student Curtis Delamere has spent months convincing concerned fiance Emma Brooker and her dad Steve McDonald that he is dying from an incurable heart complaint.But shocked viewers this week saw Curtis’s doctor confirm, that as they’ve told him many times, there’s nothing wrong with his heart and that he’s suffering from factitious disorder. Curtis is only  and it turns out he has had the condition for years. Actor Sam Retford, who plays Curtis, says he hopes viewers won’t hate his character as his deception and manipulation are exposed.  As part of his factitious disorder, Curtis has lied that he has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but Sam says: “I hope viewers will have sympathy. He’s not sitting there in the morning thinking: ‘what lies am I going to tell today ’ It’s not malicious. He’s just lonely. “If we could all have a button we could press and it means that people love you, of course we would all day long, because it’s a nice thing that people care for you.” For Cindy too the problems began in childhood. “I actually can’t remember a time when I didn’t have the disorder,” she recalls. “As young as four I pretended I had flu, or didn’t feel very well. “When I was six I would purposely try to fall off swings and hurt myself. I got a few bruises and I was always a bit disappointed it wasn’t more!”  She is puzzled why it developed. “The only thing I’ve been able to think is that my Mum had really bad migraines,” she says. “She’d be in bed and couldn’tand I remember being left to fend on my own quite a bit. Maybe it was a way of getting people’s attention so I had more support.” As Cindy got older the disorder got worse and when she got to high school she began pretending to faint. “I got attention for the fainting, so that turned into pretending I had seizures. I’d shake and people said I must have epilepsy,” she recalls. “At university it got so bad that even though my EEG tests were normal, they decided to put me onto medication. “It spiralled out of control and I wound up in the hospital in a seizure monitoring unit. They were talking about brain surgery at one point to stop the seizures. That was pretty scary, but the problem with the disorder is that I’ve always wanted to be sick, so I was actually hoping that they would do surgery. That’s the crazy thing. “Over the years I’ve also taken five overdoses and all except one were part of the factitious disorder. It was a way of getting attention.”  Cindy, who lives in Alberta, Canada is one of the few people in the world to admit publicly to having the disorder. Psychiatry professor Marc Feldman, the world authority on the illness, says that it is notoriously hard to detect. He explains: “Even physicians can miss a diagnosis and many patients continue their denial. Then,the patient lies about what is going on, a therapist is not going to be able to address it, so you have to work slowly to build trust.” So determined were Coronation Street to get the storyline right that they contacted Dr Marc Feldman who did Zoom interviews with researchers and writers and also spoke atto actor Sam. He says: “Afterwards they sent me pages of scripts with specic questions, such as: ‘does this ring true ’ They wanted to get it as accurate as possible. “I’ve written so much about factitious disorder over the past  years and I was more than happy to help. It seemed a great opportunity to make the public more aware of the disorder.” The most extreme case of factitious disorder was that of Wendy Scott who was admitted to hospital  times under  pretences and had  abdominal operations. Born in Scotland she was known to hospitals throughout Europe. Sadly, when she suffered real pain nobody believed her. Eventually it was discovered that she had advanced abdominal cancer from which she died in .  Dr Feldman, who has interviewed hundreds of patients with the disorder, says: “I had one patient who instilled a caustic substance into her bladder, ultimately forcing the bladder to be removed. She now has a bag. Some of the cases are quite shocking.” The syndrome was first identied in the s and named Munchausen’s Syndrome after German aristocrat Baron Munchausen, who was known for his exaggerated story-telling. Factitious disorder imposed on another, previously called Munchausen’s by proxy, is a iant of the syndrome, in which someone fakes or induces illness in someone under their care, usually a mother with their child. The disorder has taken its toll on Cindy’s health. “There’s been a little bit of cognitive impairment, some memory issues. I notice after concussions that I haven’t been as sharp,” she admits. “I’ve also damaged a nerve in my face, so I can’t lt my left eyebrow. I’ve had lots of black eyes, bloody noses and stitches.” Cindy, who is single, has had boyfriends in the past, but kept them and all her friends and family in the dark about her condition. It was only after being diagnosed as bipolar in her s that she first confessed to a doctor. Now she is on medication for her bipolar disorder she has fewer impulses to harm herself or fake illness. Ten years ago she found religion which has also helped. “That was a lot of comfort to me – I could get attention from God,” she explains. After writing her memoir Liar, Liar, Gown on Fire, she says those close to her now understand more about the disorder and whilst many were initially angry, they have forgiven her for the deceit, Yet Cindy doubts she will ever properly recover. “I still do it sometimes I did it as recently as this summer. It’s become a coping mechanism when I’m under stress,” she says. “I don’t really think I’ll ever be cured. It’s been part of my le forever. It’s not just a matter of faking it, I actually want to be physically ill and that has never gone away. StillI get a little bit of a cough, I’m hoping its Covid.”For more information go to munchausen Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronation StreetHospitalsHeart diseaseMental healthSoap operasPrescriptionsFluFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Dont miss out on the biggest soaps gossip!

In the BBC documentary, The Princes and The Press, Jenny Afia said there were massive inaccuracies in the story that Meghan had bullied some of her staff.The allegations surfaced publicly in March this year and were branded a calculated smear campaign by the Sussexes, who fiercely deny any wrongdoing.On True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, royal expert Richard Kay questioned Meghanaposs lawyeraposs remarks.He said: “The thing that struck me about Jenny Afia was where she categorically said, as Meghan’s lawyer, that the allegations of bullying were untrue.  She is in no position to know that. She could have said ‘I am advised as her lawyer that the allegations are untrue’, but she wasn’t there and she doesn’t know what the nature of the investigation by Buckingham Palace is, [and] which is still ongoing into the claims and counterclaims.”During the documentary, broadcast on Monday night, Ms Afia was asked by presenter Amol Rajanthe story about bullying allegations, which first appeared in The Times, was accurate.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. She told the programme: The overall allegation was that the Duchess of Sussex is guilty of bullying. Absolutely not. The first thing is to be really clear about what bullying is. What bullying actually means is improperly using power deliberately and repeatedly to hurt someone physically or emotionally. The Duchess of Sussex has absolutely denied ever doing that. That said, she wouldnapost want to negate anyoneaposs personal experience. When askedshe provided any evidence to refute the claims, the lawyer added: It is really hard to prove a negative. Soyou havenapost bullied someone how do you prove you havenapost.  Just denying the allegation... doesnapost address the underlying problem that the allegation has been made.The documentary, which aired its first part last week, set out to explore the relationships between Princes William and Harry and the press.In the first episode last week, there were claims that negative stories about Meghan were leaked by courtiers and there was competitiveness between William and Harry’s respective households. In a joint statement that was shown at the end of the documentary both this week and last week, Buckingham Palace, Kensington Palace and Clarence House said: “A free, responsible and open Press is of vital importance to healthy democracy. “However, too often overblown and unfounded claims from unknown sources are presented as facts and it is disappointing when anyone, including the BBC, gives them credibility.”The Royal Beat - available on True Royalty TV.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryPrince WilliamMeghan MarkleRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

After previously confirming over the phone that they would accommodate her upon her arrival, when she got there, a member of hotel staff told her they could not help. At am on Saturday, November , Laura received a distressed call from her daughter, whose trip to visit Plymouth had quickly become a desperate situation of searching for a place of safety in an unfamiliar city.“We live down in West Sussex so we are too far away to pop into a car and help her out, Laura told PlymouthLive.“I had phoned the Jurys Inn and explained I needed to get her a room and I would like to arrange and pay for that over the phone. “The person on the front desk said they are having IT issues and that the system was down butshe could get to the hotel, they would sort it out when she got there. “She got to the point where she had no choice but to walk to the hotel, in a city she didnapost know, in a very scared and vulnerable state.  “She got to the hotel and was then told ‘well I told your mother we have an IT issue’ and told her to go to the Crowne Plaza, which was a twenty-five minute walk away. Living over a five-hour drive away, Laura did everything she could to help her daughter by calling taxi companies and contacting other hotels to no avail. “I then saw there was a train at :am, said Laura, so I then directed her towards the train station and got her on a train where she would be semi-safe.” Laura wants to highlight what happened to her daughter in Plymouth last month so more can be done by people and businesses to recognise when a young woman needs a place of safety. The distressed mum wants to see changes made in the future to avoid this sort of situation happening again. “It’s not acceptable whataposs happened, she said. Iaposll strongly fight for the fact that this is wrong and the next girl in that situation needs to be recognised. It’s common sense. “People need to be aware of the safety of young women, even more so at this time, not that it should ever have to be like that, but it obviously is. “It’s not even that people need to be extra vigilant, it’s having common sense. A Jurys Inn’s spokesperson said: “The welfare of guests and the general public is of the utmost importance to us. We are looking into what occurred on the morning in question.” Laura said she found it “distressing” to talk about the incident now. She had her daughter crying on the phone, walking around alone, and the only way her mum could see her location was through a ‘find my friend’ app where she helped guide direct her from miles away. Laura said, even before she rang The Jury Inn, she called multiple Plymouth taxi companies from her home in Sussex, hoping they could collect her or help her get to accommodation, but none of them were able to help. She said: “It was a desperate situation. She was at risk where she was. I honestly feel like common sensea young girl turns up at that time in the morning, why on earth would you not just let her sit in the lobby  Why not help her out or offer her some kind of support  “I am so physically shocked. If something had happened, I felt so powerless because it would have taken me five hours to get to her. “It physically makes me cry thinking about what happened because a common sense approach would be to get her in a position of safety.

Amy Smith, , has been getting tattoos since she was  and she has her own tattoo gun. The mum, from Leicester, says her appearance gets judged as security guards follow her in the shops and other parents cross the road when they see her. Amy, who is a mum to Elijah, six, and Remy, one, also says sheaposs been told she shouldnapost look like that. Her oldest child is protective over Amy and even draws his own tattoo designs to cheer her up. She said: Now, I have two children, Elijah and Remy, and my tattoos attract a lot of attention. “Parents my own age can be very judgemental – some parents cross the road to get their children away from me, and I tend to get followed by security in shops that don’t know me.  “My kids have witnessed the negative comments and they see the way that it makes me feel – I feel like my kids are far more accepting than most people because of it. “However, it can also be really heart-warming. I get spoken to a lot on the school run or at school events, and parents have even turned around and told me that they would love to be able to have tattoos like mine. “I know that as a parent, I shouldn’t be scared to be who I want to be.” She hopes she can show her children that it is to be yourself and let other people do the same. Amy said: “Sometimes people tell me, ‘you’re a parent’ or ‘you’re a woman,’ so I ‘shouldn’t look like this’ – I’ve had my fair share of backlash.“Still, some of the responses I’ve had make me feel really great – I’ve had messages on Instagram with people telling me that I’ve inspired them to get a tattoo that they wanted.“I don’t regret a thing – my tattoos have changed my le. It’s brought so many opportunities to do some really amazing things. “I’m comfortable with who I am, and I want to encourage my children to feel the same way.”  Amy does say not all of her experiences are negative as her tattoos are sometimes a conversation starter on the school run, and some parents do chat to her, even asking for advice about getting tattoos. She hopes to raise her sons to be open and accepting of others – no matter how they look or dress. She said: “I’ve always been interested in tattoos. I remember watching Miami Ink when I was around , and from then, my heart was set on getting tattoos and learning how to do them. “I got my first tattoo at thirteen – a stick-and-poke, but because I was so hell-bent on learning how to do tattoos, I was bought a tattoo machine for my fourteenth birthday. “That really helped me to get the practice I needed to get into the industry.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsSchool runTattoos\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Experts are worried that the Omicron iant could be more transmissible, though this has not yet been confirmed. It is still unknownit is also more resistant to vaccines and how bad its symptoms are. Cases are currently low in the UK and research is underway to try and work outthe iant is going to be more of a problem, but medical experts advised caution and new restrictions were put in place as a result. One way of combating the spread is through these restrictions, which has seen mandatory mask-wearing reintroduced on public transport, in shops and a range of other outlets.However, this does not necessarily help over the long-term and as viruses continue to mutate and change, there is now talk about people having to have regular jabs to keep the disease at bay. So will we have to have regular Covid jabs  Will we need to have annual Covid booster jabs   The government has already extended its booster jab programme to all eligible adults, who can expect to receive their booster by the end of January.Now though, the boss of vaccine creator and pharmaceutical company Pfizer has said that yearly vaccinations may be required.Dr Albert Bourla told the BBC : Based on everything I have seen so far, I would say that annual vaccinations… are likely to be needed to maintain a very robust and very high level of protection. Bourla also said that targeting areas where viruses can flourish would be a positive step. Schools, for example, have a high concentration of people, so vaccinating young children would help prevent against a large spread of the virus. The Pfizer jab has already been approved in the US for five to -year-olds. Covid in schools is thriving, Bourla said. This is disturbing, signicantly, the educational system, and there are kids that will have severe symptoms. So there is no doubt in my mind that the benefits, completely, are in favour of doing it. Is a new vaccine for the Omicron mutant iant being made   Vaccines work by helping our body to produce the correct antibodies should an infection occur, but this is more dficult to keep on top of once a virus mutates. Essentially, the codes we have to fight off the virus are working against something slightly dferent than before. As a result, opinion is split onthe current vaccines will work against the Omicron iant and there is already work underway to tweak the vaccine. The boss of Moderna warned that the current vaccine would not be as effective.  Ugur Sahinaposs opinion dfered from the Moderna boss. The CEO of BioNTechtold Sky News: To my mind thereaposs no reason to be particularly worried. The only thing that worries me at the moment is the fact that there are people that have not been vaccinated at all. NBC News reported that Pfizer and BioNTech said they could develop an Omicron-specic vaccine within six weeks and ship initial batches within  daysthis is needed.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Pfizer Inc.SchoolsCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccine\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Fawcett, who resigned as the Foundationaposs chief executive after a string of allegations, was also involved in directing money from a Saudi billionaireaposs foundation to another charity of which Charles was patron, it was revealed. Dame Sue Bruce, chair of the Princeaposs Foundation, described the recent crises surrounding the future kingaposs charitable organisation as a dficult chapter, but said lessons will be learned to ensure the charity always acts with the utmost integrity and probity. A Clarence House spokesman said the Prince was grateful to independent auditors for reviewing procedures. He added: It is important to His Royal Highness that the charities which bear his name operate to the highest standards, in accordance with rules established by charity regulators. We are taking this opportunity to reinforce guidance to these charities, particularly in respect of their relationships with supporters. The independent investigation into fundraising practices was ordered by the Foundation and carried out independently by auditing firm Ernst  Young.  Its findings, released on Thursday, will be shared with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator , which is examining dealings at the Foundation. A summary of the findings revealed that Mr Fawcett and another unnamed senior employee were involved in directing a transfer of funds from the Mahfouz Foundation to the Children and the Arts Foundation , which is now defunct. The activity, including written correspondence, took place without the knowledge or approval of The Princeaposs Foundation trustees, according to the investigation. The Charity Commission has launched an inquiry into the Mahfouz Foundation, which was founded by Saudi billionaire Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, into allegations that donations intended for the Princeaposs Foundation went to CATA instead. The Princeaposs Foundation initially received £, from Russian banker Dmitry Leus, via the Mahfouz Foundation, but Charlesaposs charityaposs ethics committee rejected the money and ed it to the Mahfouz Foundation. Mr Fawcett was subsequently involved in directing a transfer of funds from the Mahfouz Foundation to CATA, the summary said. The investigation also found evidence of Mr Fawcettaposs communications and co-ordination with so-called aposfixersapos regarding honorary nominations for a donor between -, the summary said, but trustees were not aware at the time of this correspondence. Dame Sue said: The board of trustees agreed unequivocally that the recent allegations had to be independently investigated so that the facts could be established, and all necessary steps could be taken to address the issues identied.

The board of trustees is determined that lessons will be learned to ensure that, in future, our charity maintains the highest standards in all areas and always acts with the utmost integrity and probity. As we move through this dficult chapter, I hope that the stories of note will begin to focus once more on the beneficial outcomes delivered by The Princeaposs Foundation, and we look forward with optimism to continuing to deliver our charitable activities.

A further  people who had meals at the pub on October , , were also unwell while only three diners were fine and that was because they ordered vegetarian options, , reported the Daily Star.. John Croucher, the -year-old former head chef, was handed a four-month suspended jail sentence at Reading Crown Court on Tuesday.Members of the Holy Trinity Church gathered for a meal at the pub but the meat in the shepherdaposs pie was not cooked properly the night before, the court heard.  Croucher admitted that he had been rushed and placed the meat, which had not been fully cooked, in cling film in the fridge. The next day it was cooked again with mashed potato but the temperature of the meat wasnapost checked. Croucher admitted to contravening food regulations and said: I really hate to say it but I think I was rushed. I was rushing. Remorse is an understatement. This is something I will never forget. Because of it, I am a better chef and it is just a shame the cost of it had to be what it was. Neil Billingham, the -year-old owner and landlord, admitted to three charges of contravening food regulations.  He was personally fined £,, plus £, court costs, and his company The Bobcat Pub Co was fined nearly £,. Judge Sarah Campbell said: A healthy and well person died of a gastrointestinal haemorrhage induced from vomiting. No sentence I can pass can reflect the loss caused to the family. The Crewe Arms is an important pub to the local community. I have read many references from members of the community, who all say Mr Billingham worked hard to maintain the support of the community, including Mrs Neuman’s daughter. But the judge refused to accept claims that it was a one-off mistake. While it has since gained the maximum five star food hygiene rating, at the time of the tragedy the Crewe Arms had just one star. Prosecutor Carl May-Smith pointed out how food safety officers had even been trying to help venues in the area with low ratings. He said: The pub even had the advantage of coaching from the local authority. Inspections before the offence showed there was no food safety management system in place.

Pat Aldridge spent five days in hospital where she needed intermittent oxygen.But doctors were amazed as she made a full recovery and was able to be discharged andhome to Nynehead Court in Wellington, Somerset.The day after her discharge, she was already back taking part in quizzes, coffee mornings, knitting and going for her daily walk around the care home grounds. And she was able to enjoy proper birthday celebrations to mark her th year, which included a visit from her family in the morning before a party in the afternoon with staff and residents, plus a special cake baked for her. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Home manager, Joanne Fenn, said: We were delighted to be able to help Pat share her special day. She is a remarkable lady, who has reached a wonderful age. Pat said that although she doesnapost really eat cake she was looking forward to a piece of birthday cake. She loved her flowers but asked for them to be spread around the home for everyone to enjoy. She is an absolute delight to look after and enjoys nothing more than a lovely sing-song with staff and other residents.  Pat was born in Solihull on November  , four months after the outbreak of the First World War. She was one of eight children and is the only one of her siblings to reach the age of . Pat was married to her husband, Ken, for  years until she was widowed in . She lived independently in the community until recently when she decided to move to Nynehead Court to remain close to her friends. Staff there had initially noticed she had low oxygen levels during her daily check-in April last year and was given antibiotics which didnapost improve. She tested positive for Covid- on arrival in hospital but says she didnapost need an oxygen mask. She was put on oxygen and staff say that even on the morning after she was admitted she already wanted to get up and about to do everything for herself.  At the time Pat said: I did not have a high temperature until the night I was admitted to hospital. I wasnapost frightened of seeing hospital staff in PPE as I had seen staff at the home wearing it and I donapost really remember the moment I was told I had beaten the virus. But I am just pleased to be back amongst my friends at the home and I feel as bright as I can for someone my age. Since I have come out of hospital, I have enjoyed catching up with my knitting which I do every day and have also attended an in-house coffee morning and a quiz. I donapost remember much about the virus. But my advice to everyone  at the moment is just to take each day as it comes and appreciate the small things, whatever age you are. Staff at Nynehead Court described Pat as a very stoical and resilient lady who never complains and takes each day as it comes. They added that sheaposs a very sociable lady who enjoys going to a lunch club on Wednesdays. She has previously put her long le down to her healthy diet which restricts sugar and fat, especially cake. Musgrove Park Doctor Benedict Morris previously said he had concerns for Pat when her infection became clear. He said: We always worry about anyone who tests positive, particularly those who are a little bit older. You do worry but she is made of stern stuff and thataposs what we saw when we met her.

The vaccine was administered to millions across the world, but the side-effect meant that the vaccine was no longer offered to those under -years-old. However, after being given government funding to conduct research on the vaccine, scientists from Cardf University and Arizona State University have found some answers. Their research shows that a protein in the blood is attracted to a key component of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine which causes a reaction that results in the clots. When the vaccine is injected into the body, some of its contents can go into the blood stream.  In extremely rare cases, this can cause a protein called platelet factor  to be attracted to the vaccine. When this occurs, the body mistakes the protein for the virus, and releases antibodies to fight it. This results in a blood clot forming as the antibodies join together.The findings of the study were published in the journal Science Advances.While this research has provided an understanding into the formation of the blood clots, it is not yet clear exactly why this happens. The creators of the vaccine stress that the blood clots are more likely to be caused by coronavirus infection rather than the actual vaccine.Earlier in May, the UKaposs medicines safety regulator said there had been  clotting cases and  deaths after . million doses of the vaccine were given. This caused the vaccine to not be given to under-s. At present, blood clots from the vaccine have been linked to  deaths out of nearly  million doses of AstraZeneca. The vaccines that are distributed in the UK contain a party portion of the Covid-virusaposs genetic code which is injected into the body to train the immune system. Some vaccines package the code inside spheres of fat, whereas AstraZeneca used an adenovirus, which in their case is a common cold that acts as a delivering agent. The scientists suspected that this aspect of the vaccine could be linked to the blood clots. Their research found that the outer area of the adenovirus attracts the platelet factor four protein. Professor Alan Parker, one of the researchers at Cardf University, said the chain reaction is an ultra-rare side-effect that occurs in a very small number of cases.He told BBC News: The adenovirus has an extremely negative surface, and platelet factor four is extremely positive and the two things fit together quite well. What we have is the trigger, but thereaposs a lot of steps that have to happen next. Despite the very small risk of blood clots, scientists urge the public to still get vaccinated as the benefits heavily outweigh the risks. Professor Parker added: You could never have predicted it would have happened and the chances are vanishingly small, so we need to remember the bigger picture of the number of lives this vaccine has saved. This groundbreaking discovery has given a better understanding into the formation of blood clots, but there is still some research to be done. The researchers believe that the next stage may be misplaced immunity, but this needs to be confirmed in further studies.  Dr Will Lester, a consultant haematologist, said: This is a very detailed scientic study from experts in the field and provides further pieces to a jigsaw of understanding vaccine induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis. The authors reasonably speculate that one might be able to mody future adenoviral based vaccines to avoid this unwanted rare untoward effect. Many questions still remain unanswered including whether some people may be more susceptible than others and why the thrombosis is most commonly in the veins of the brain and liver but this may come with time and further research.

The makesht Christmas tree was then wrapped in gold and red tinsel. Ella and her pal then covered the base of it with brown paper and fixing it down with sticky tape. They then put a silver, present bow on the top for a star. The pair at Leeds Beckett University, West Yorkshire, filmed them giving the cone - which they insisted wasn’t pinched - the makeover. She posted it on TikTok and the  second clip has got more than , views and , likes.  It finishes with them putting their homemade Christmas tree in their living room of their uni digs. Ella, of Newcastle, said: Turning our not stolen traffic cone into a Christmas tree. The video had the Frank Sinantra festive hit aposLet it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow aposplaying. Fellow student Jaden Higgins said: Iaposm howling. I love this. Another - called Holly - added: Should put it back out like that after Christmas. David said: Canapost wait til Iaposm in uni now. Now we are in December, people up and down the country are bring out the decorations to celebrate.But one townaposs attempt to get into the mood has been met with giggles from locals, after a Christmas tree was installed at a wonky angle.The tree, covered in blue and white lights with red baubles, appeared to mimic the Leaning Tower of Pisa with Gosport residents, Hants, jokily posing aspropping it up. Jan Richardson, who lives in the area, said she saw it being put up while gales were blowing due to Storm Arwen. She said: I watched the tree being taken off the lorry the other night and they had a dreadful time with the wind. The installation of the festive decorations has not been smooth sailing as the townaposs first tree was damaged in transit.

Becky Jackson, , and her two sons claim they have been sharing their home in Liverpool, Merseyside with the unwelcome fellow occupants for six years. Now the mum of two says the situation has become so bad that the sound of them running around haunts her even when sheaposs not there, leaving her too terried to .I am too scared to even go back to my house today — I just canapost do it, itaposs too much. Becky told the Liverpool Echo. She said: I went to my sisteraposs last night. I canapost even sleep — Iaposm so used to hearing rats, I started hearing noises in her house and she doesnapost even have them.  It used to be I could just hear them scurrying in the walls when I was at home, now I can hear them running around the house. I catch them on my camera in the kitchen when Iaposm in the living room. Theyaposre living here with me. Rats normally come out at night, but not these. These have got brave — they come out in the daytime. In a bid to provide evidence to her housing association to get them to act on the situation, Becky has resorted to laying bait in front of cameras, capturing footage of the rats. Now the mum, whose sons are just five and six, fears for the safety and health of her family. She said: Iaposve been told [the housing association] canapost see any evidence, so I thought aposlet me bait my own house to get the proof I needapos. I took a loaf out of the freezer to defrost and when I came back they had chewed through it so I knew I could bait them with bread. But theyaposve become immune to the baitthat makes sense.  Theyaposll chew through anything though — I came home once and they had chewed through my childrenaposs vitamins. They donapost care what they eat. She added: On my camera I saw a rat run down my fridge and two minutes later, my eldest child was stood where it had been. That rat could have bit him and they carry all kinds of diseases and stuff. One of my children is on the pathway to autism and ADHD and heaposd sit there and play with the rats and poison. My children should be able to walk around their house without me worrying that theyaposre going to get sick. The property is managed by Cobalt Housing Association, who Becky claims have not done enough to solve the problem adding that they have sent someone out on two occasions. Instead, she believes the situation is so bad that the house needs entirely rebuilding from scratch as she in unable to pinpoint the source of the issue. A spokesperson for Cobalt Housing Association told the ECHO : We are sorry for the problems Ms Jackson has been experiencing. We are already speaking with her, and a formal complaint has been raised and is being dealt with. We have been working with Ms Jackson and our contractors to address the problems, and employed an environmental and pest control services company to provide additional support to resolve the situation. A number of housing officers and surveyors have also attended the property to support the process.

Scientists are racing to work outthe new iant, first discovered in southern Africa, spreads faster, circumvents vaccines or causes worse side affects.Experts say people are presenting cold-like symptoms since receiving the vaccine and according to the ZOE Covid symptom study app, people who test positive most commonly report a headache, runny nose, sore throat and sneezing, The Sun reported.Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, said the main symptoms of Cmicron to look out for are:Fatigue Body aches Headache She described one “very interesting case” of a six-year-old girl who had “a temperature and a very high pulse rate. A World Health Organizationofficial has told the Reuters news agency that most people are not getting seriously ill, although it could still be the case.  Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, a top WHO adviser, said: “In terms of the severity profile, we have seen reports of cases with Omicron that go from mild disease all the way to severe disease. “There is some indication that some of the patients are presenting with mild disease, but again it is early days. We do have a surveillance bias right now in terms of the cases that are being detected.  “There is also a suggestion of increased hospitalisations across South Africa, but that could be the sheer fact that we have more cases. “If you have more cases you will have more hospitalisations.” Meanwhile, a health director in Botswana said  out of  people infected had no symptoms, while the other three had “very, very mild” illness.

The Met Office has issued three yellow warnings for ice across the UK and a weather alert states that there is an % chance of severe cold and heavy snow between Wednesday and this Saturday.It states to expect: Some injuries from slips and falls on icy surface. Probably some icy patches on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle path. Some roads and railways likely to be affected by ice and perhaps snow, resulting in longer journey times.  Netweather charts for Thursday show that the temperature could hit lows of -C in Scotland and -C across northern England, the South East and Wales. But the wind chill factor means that these temperatures of -C will feel more like -C. It is set to be another bitterly cold night on Thursday with weather charts showing freezing blue patches for much of the country. WXCharts maps suggest that there could be up to cm of snow in northern Scotland overnight on Wednesday and spreading across northern England on Thursday.  A Met Office spokesperson said: Itaposs going to be a lot colder today with showers turning wintry in the north. Patchy rain and snow will then affect some western and southern areas before more snow over the next few days. Only a few areas will be spared. The snow is expected to remain over the coming days and over the weekend despite some slightly milder temperatures.Netweather senior forecaster Jo Farrow, reported the Express, said: It’s going to turn colder and there is a bit of snow in the forecast for the next few days. In the blustery flow over Britain, there will be further downpours with hail showers possible as the wind veers to the north. For the UK, a colder airflow follows. Digging down from the Arctic right through western Europe as the jetstream buckles. The low pressure shts towards the Baltic Sea, the Azores high is in place and the cold northerly wind will bring some snow showers. By Thursday night a frontal system will be toppling in from the Atlantic with another low pressure for Saturday. It’s all quite active and mobile.UK forecast for the next  days Today: Rain, sleet and some snow clearing from southwestern parts. Wintry showers affecting the north and east, slowly becoming confined to Norfolk this afternoon, with gales along North Sea coasts slowly easing. Mostly dry and sunny inland but feeling cold. Tonight: Rain reaching northwestern parts, preceded by some snow across Scotland, and moving southeastwards across most parts. Turning milder for most after a cold start. Friday: Outbreaks of rain and drizzle clearing southeastwards, though further rain likely in the southwest later. Brighter in the north with a few showers for northern and western Scotland. Feeling milder. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Sunny spells and blustery showers with snow on hills this weekend, becoming confined to eastern areas on Sunday. Rain and perhaps some snow spreading east on Monday with showers following.

Emma Thompson, , decided to get breast implants in  which took her from an A-cup to a C-cup. Within a few years of having the implants, the former DJ who now works as a recruitment director began to suffer from severe heart palpitations, panic attacks and muscle weakness. Her symptoms became worse and she started sleeping for up to  hours a day and was too weak to climb the stairs or brush her teeth. GPs were baffled by her condition that left her unable to walk at one point.  Emma decided to go to a al medicine practitioner. She was horried to find out she had Breast Implant Illness as her body was reacting to silicone that had been passing from her implants into the surrounding tissue and beyond - a process called aposbleeding. In , Emma flew to the Netherlands and paid £, to have her implants removed. Now, she has celebrated winning a boxing match just  months after recovering. Sporty Emma has regained her energy and has celebrated a spectacular boxing match victory - just  months since the debilitating symptoms had left her so weak she would struggle to even brush her hair. She said: When I had the implants out, I instantly looked like a dferent person.  She added: [Breast implant illness] canapost be denied any longer. I want to raise awareness. After the initial excitement of her bustier cleavage, Emma began to experience bad skin, panic attacks and feel exhausted no matter how much she slept. This continued over several years resulting in her fearing sheaposd suffered a stroke when she collapsed at home. Emma said: I felt so much more confident and loved them but in the first few years my skin started to change. She added: This is all linked to producing cortisol so that the body could continue to fight what it perceived as a foreign object. Sometimes Iaposd sleep for  hours a day then it would switch where Iaposd have that same level of exhaustion but couldnapost sleep.  A month later she collapsed at home. She said: It was terrying. I thought I was having a stroke. I didnapost understand what was happening. I rang my mum and she rushed down the motorway. We went to AE and I was in hospital for three days. I left that hospital unable to walk through the doors because it was too far. I could barely get to the toilet. They did loads of blood tests and told me there was nothing wrong, they just dismissed it. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.That was my le then for seven years. You feel a bit crazy because you know thereaposs something physically wrong. Her symptoms forced her to take time off work and she had to buy an automatic car because she was too weak to change gears. Emma said: I couldnapost even brush my own hair. I was exhausted. I used to have to use my left arm to hold my right hand in place to brush it. I had to shower sitting down. Breast Implant Illnessis a term sometimes used by people to describe a iety of health problems they associate with their breast implants.The reports often describe symptoms like aposbrain fogapos, fatigue, anxiety and joint pain.These health problems are very concerning for those experiencing them. There have also been reports of a serious medical condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body .Some people have reported their symptoms improve once their breast implants were removed.Currently, it is not knownthere is a link between breast implants and the reported health problems, as there is no single disease which could explain the symptoms some people are reporting to us or to their clinicians. Source: Gov.uk It was a case of when I was brushing my teeth, it was exhausting and painful. My legs used to burn so much by the second step of the stairs. Iaposd have to stop halfway up. Emma finally had her implants removed in July . Emma said: They were half full when they took them out. When she [the surgeon] showed me, she said aposlook how much has bled into your systemapos. [After my implants were removed] all of the panic stopped, all the palpitations stopped. It wasnapost just physical symptoms. They were toxic. After experiencing an incredible recovery, Emma gradually built herself up, from running a slow km to attending Thai boxing once a week. Earlier this year, Emma was able to start training intensely for her first boxing match and in October and won. Emma said: It was a very big process from then. I had to slowly build up. She added: I was ill up until they came out in July  and I started training properly within a few months. The [Thai boxing] win was great but it wasnapost about the win. I knew Iaposd won and done well and thataposs brilliant, but that moment was about everything. It was about everything thataposd happened in those eight years.

Sarah Beckett was doing her shopping at her local store when her e-cigarette battery reportedly exploded in her pocket. Shoppers raced to the -year-oldaposs rescue when she began to scream as her clothes went up in flames. The quick-thinking heroes doused her in water they had grabbed from bottles on the shelves, stopping her from getting badly injured. Her husband Andrew Beckett believes the cause of the explosion may have been a spare battery from an electronic cigarette that Sarah was carrying in her pocket. He told the Liverpool Echo:[She was] walking around Aldi and feels and hears something in her pocket, all seems a bit surreal but she remembers screaming and a older couple coming to her assistance. Weaposve later found out from a guy on Facebook that these batteries can shortthe positive end comes in contact with say a key or a coin.So it shorted in her pocket and exploded like a firework when you first light it, lighting her clothes, coat and jumper. Andy said luckily there were some brilliant people in the store who immediately jumped in to help after seeing Sarah, from Newton-le -Willows in distress. He said: An old couple came rushing over, as she opened her coat the red hot battery slid out of the hole it had melted and bounced along the floor still glowing orange. The old lady kicked it away, grabbed a chair from somewhere and started to douse her with water from the shelf in Aldi. The older lady stayed with her all the way through, rubbing her arms and comforting her.  Andy said he was working in North Wales when he got the awful phone call from his weaposs phone. He added: A young man then took her phone and rang me from it, I could hear her screaming and panicking in the background. I keep thinking that a few minutes earlier she would have been driving on the main roads of Newton-Le-Willows and it haunts me to think what might have happened. I think we both had a little private whimper to ourselves last night when I got her home, she was very lucky, and also very lucky that certain members of public were in the shop at the same time. People definitely need to be made aware, we didnapost have the slightest idea the dangers of a loose battery. Sarah, who was taken to hospital, is now recovering at home after receiving suspected second degree burns which she is receiving treatment for at Whiston Hospital burns unit.

One woman, who already had several tattoos, has shared how she was recently offered a free inking from her tattoo artist after he heard she was going through a rough time.In a post on TikTok, a user named @itsmehollyholliday, explained that she was going through a separation from her husband and as such a local tattoo artist said heaposd give her some aposink therapyapos. Holly claimed sheaposd had work done by him previously, so trusted him to do another great tattoo, reports The Daily Star. She picked out a gorgeous design to go on her forearm, featuring flowers, a stack of books and some stars sparkles, however, things didnapost quite go to plan. In a series of videos online Holly, who lives in the US, shared how her arm had been ruined by the tattoo artist leaving her angry and crying. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Her original post was captioned: Iaposm so angry, Iaposve cried so much. I trusted this artist, heaposs done great work in the past for me... My trust is now ruined and so is my arm. In this clip, she showed off the botched inking, with wobbly lines and random shading. A follow-up video saw her provide more of a backstory, saying: I get to his house about : and Iaposm there for like an hour and a half, weaposre just talking back and forth, she says in a follow-up video. Iaposm playing with the dog, no big deal. He starts getting everything set up and like I said, just normal conversation, I did not think anything was off. So he gets me in the chair and starts free-handing a design based off of the original cute little book tattoo I found online. I didnapost want this exact, thing just something like it. He drew it on, looked great, I made sure the placement was fine. Everything looked good. Holly goes on to explain that after heaposd started on her arm, she noticed his hand was bearing down quite hard and going back and forth, then his head began to droop. So she asked himeverything was ok. When he replied, she claims he was slurring his word, which is when she became rather freaked out and tried to come up with a plan to get out of there without p***ing him off. She added: I am fully aware that I am at fault here for not stopping the artist sooner, but I was trying not to put myself in a situation where it could have escalated to something worse. Iaposm trying to conjure up a story and I noticed that the linework was s***ty. I keep looking over every once in a while and itaposs making me sick to look at. Thereaposs a random line right here. I donapost know what that was supposed to be. As well as a botched design, Holly shows how she also ended up with a random ink mark on her hand, as he caught her with the needle while getting more ink. Eventually, she managed to get out of his house, by getting a friend to call with a fake emergency. He has contacted me several times asking me to come back and let him fix it but I donapost want to go back to this man, she adds. I donapost want to have anything to do with this man, Iaposve not even confronted this man about this tattoo yet. Iaposm still just livid about this tattoo.More than four million people have since watched Hollyaposs original video, with one person branding the tattoo insanely bad.Another replied: Looks like a child got hold of a tattoo gun. While someone  asked: How did he mess it up this bad  A dferent user added: Please please tell me this is a joke and thataposs not permanently on you !Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Since Monday, burning rock from the eruption poured onto the towns that sat around the volcano, reaching speeds of up to one metre per second. La Palma is a Canary Island that was home to , people, but since the eruption on September  , , people have been displaced. The volcano erupted after days of seismic activities and earthquakes on the island, which resulted in the country being put on amber alert.  It had been  years since the volcano last blew, which lead to the evacuation of the town of Fuencaliente. The volcano also erupted in , which lasted for  days and resulted in a large crack forming on its surface that was one-and-a-half kilometres in . This time, lava has been flowing for around two-and-a-half months, with the Canary Islands Volcanology Institute reporting more molten flow this week. Scorching hot lava has continued to light up the island as it has been spat out of Cumbre Vieja. A number of new volcanic vents opened in La Palma, releasing new lava that threatens threatened to intensy the impact on homes and land. A staggering  hectares of land, a third of which being farmland, has been destroyed by the molten lava. Thankfully, no deaths have been caused by the crisis.  This has caused the islandaposs economy to be hit as avocado and banana plantations are engulfed by the rock. As a result of the devastation, the Spanish government has pledged  million eurosin aid to help residents of the island. The lava has already reached the Atlantic with molten rock falling off clfs into the ocean, causing a total of  hectares of lava landfill. Since the eruption, La Palma has continued to experience a number of earthquakes. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to clear roads and uncover buildings, with the Spanish Navy being called in to manage the crisis.

It would be the largest outbreak of the latest strain in the world,confirmed.Reports said  people had received a positive PCR test after Norwegian renewable energy company Scatecaposs Christmas dinner at Louise Restaurant  Bar in Aker Brygge, Oslo, on Friday.Another  people have had positive lateral flow tests. Most of those infected had been at the dinner, reportedly held in a closed room. Later in the night the restaurant became a nightclub with several guests.It has not been confirmed to be the Omicron iant yet, but tests have ruled out the Delta iant, NRK reports. Head of the infection tracking team in Oslo west, Jorum Thaulow, told Avisa Oslo: We have not received it definitively confirmed, but there are very strong indications that it is Omicron in this outbreak. The cases are being treated asthey have the Omicron iant with the correct self-isolation guidelines in place. One of those infected had recently been to South Africa, reports said.  Little is known about the recently-discovered strain but there are fears due to its high level of mutation. Dr Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of UKHSA, said: “We are continuing our efforts to understand the effect of this iant on transmissibility, severe disease, mortality, antibody response and vaccine efficacy.“ Vaccination is critical to help us bolster our defences against this new iant – please get your first, second, third or booster jab without delay. “Please make sure to wear a mask in line with government guidance, including on public transport and in shops, to help break the chains of transmission and slow the spread of this new iant.It comes as early indications show most Omicroncoronavirus cases are mild, the World Health Organisation has said. The official believes there is no evidence to suggest the efficacy of vaccines reduces when battling against the new iant.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Christmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

which swung in either direction in horrendous conditions.The sides exchanged goals in the first half, with Stuart MacLean reacting quickest in the box after the Baljaffray keeper couldn’t hold a Fraser Talbot shot and the striker scored to net his eleventh goal in eight games.Baljaffray forced a succession of corners near the end of the half and were on level terms when Red Star were only able to partially clear a corner which fell to the away side’s full back and his shot via the aid of a deflection went past young Leon Murphy in the Star goal. -Into the second half and Star could have retaken the lead when Aaron Moore latched onto a drilled cross from strike partner Stuart MacLean, however, his effort was blocked by an excellent save from the Baljaffray number one.The visitors took the lead after  minutes when a cross caused confusion in the Star defence and the Baljaffray forward had the simple task of finishing into an empty net from close range.Star huffed and puffed for an equaliser, however, they were frustrated by excellent goalkeeping until the goal came in fortuitous circumstances after a long ball was nodded past his own keeper by the Baljaffray centre back meaning the sides were level with  minutes to go.Star took the lead with five minutes remaining when Aaron Moore was able to burst clear of the Baljaffray backline and finish well into the far corner to make it -.This should have been enough to see Star over the line but Baljaffray scrambled a late equaliser when Star again failed to clear a free kick and the ball was bundled over the line to see the match end -.Lochgilphead Red Star are on their travels on Saturday November  when they face their toughest test of the season so far as they take on league leaders and title favourites

delivery by Craig Aitken.The visitors doubled their lead after  minutes when Craig Aitken broke clear down the left and finished with an excellent effort into the goalkeeper’s far corner to put Star - ahead.Star were under pressure for much of the remainder of the half but always carried a threat on the break, with Stuart MacLean’s pace causing the home side no end of problems.Into the second half, Arthurlie forced their way back into the match and pulled a goal back after a rare defensive lapse by Star on  minutes. Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

autumn evening after the local birds have gone quiet, you may hear thin, plaintive whistles from overhead, which mark the arrival of redwings.Redwings are highly sociable ndash it is not uncommon to see them in flocks of hundreds as they roam throughout the country.Their main diet is berries and they seem to display a preference for some types over others it is believed that this is based on the softness and sweetness of the berries.In mild winters you are likely to see large flocks of redwings feasting on their favourites of hawthorns and rowans however, in harsh months they may forage for fruit in gardens or urban areas.Once disturbed, the birds will take off and seek refuge in neighbouring trees or hedges. Alongside eating berries, they also feed on small insects and mealworms.Unlike other members of the thrush family which build nests in the trees, redwings prefer to build their cup-shaped nests on the ground.The nest is usually well hidden in the dense vegetation and made out of grass, mosses and twigs.Most redwings breed in Scandinavia and Iceland, with a small number breeding in the UK, most of which are concentrated in the Scottish Highlands. The population arriving here from Iceland appears slightly darker and bigger and it is treated as the distinct subspecies coburni.Unlike many migratory birds, which remain loyal to their wintering grounds, redwings present a nomadic lestyle ndash driven by food availability, they rarelyto the same place.I have already seen my first redwings in Edinburgh but I am yet to find them in East Lothian this autumn.Last winter in Musselburgh was fabulous! I particularly remember the snowfall in January during a couple of days I took off work. I liked every minute and, despite cold hands and feet, I enjoyed walking along the Esk.At one point, I spotted a buzzard perching on a snowy branchand headed towards it.As soon as I captured the bird of prey, I heard a familiar lsquotseeprsquo call coming from the hedges.I knew the redwings must have been having a lavish meal as the call was getting louder with every step I took, but I could not see them.It amazes me how dficult it is to spot these birds, even though they are medium-sized and always in large groups.I managed to sneak inside the bush and, when I looked up, I saw at least  redwings. The birds were incredibly noisy and constantly on the move. The whole bush was bustling and I felt like I was sitting at the heart of a busy factory!Until now, I found that experience one of the most challenging. It was not easy to operate the camera in such a tight space, with twigs scratching my face the entire time. I did not have a clear view of the birds either, but I could not move as it would spook them!The low winter sun was already disappearing but, eventually, I did manage to find a gap and push the camera through. After taking a few photographs, I decided to head back home.When I ed to the same spot the following day, the redwings were gone.If you have enjoyed my pictures this year and would like to see more, I now have several designs of my WildleCalendars for sale.

meeting to discuss the future of the service, before he received a response.The X bus was suspended last year by East Coast Buses, a subsidiary of Lothian Buses, following the introduction of national lockdown restrictions.The service ran through North Berwick, Dirleton, Gullane, Aberlady and Longniddry, then directly to Edinburgh via the A.Commuters from Dirleton, Gullane and Aberlady now face an extra hour in their daily commute to Edinburgh using the  bus service, which stops at Prestonpans, Wallyford, Musselburgh and Portobello.An online petition launched by Mr Hoy calling for the reinstatement of the service has now received more than  signatures.Mr Hoy said: ldquoIn early October, my office contacted East Coast Buses, who issued a standard response outlining the reasons for continued withdrawal of the service, including challenges with recruitment, the need to prioritise key services and the focus on delivering the  service.ldquoI recognise these challenges, but I also recognise they apply across all routes across the whole of the Lothians and are not confined to the X route.ldquoAfter a number of residents living in Dirleton, Gullane, Aberlady and Longniddry reached out to me about the X bus, I launched a petition calling for the reinstatement of the service.ldquoI wrote to East Coast Buses on two occasions requesting a face-to-face meeting, and followed this up with a third letter to the interim managing director of Lothian Buses.ldquoLothian Buses is owned by the four Lothian council areas, which includes East Lothian Council. That makes it accountable to the residents of our community.ldquoThe number of signatures on the petition shows the clear strength of feeling in the area about reinstating the X bus.ldquoAt this point, Lothian Buses have their heads buried in the sand ndash they cannot keep ignoring our communities.In a letter to Mr Hoy dated November , Nigel Serafini, interim managing director of Lothian Buses, said it was the companyrsquos ldquopriority to re-establish the X ldquoas soon as driver resource permits.He added: ldquoThe X covers no additional areas that service  does not .ldquoIn contrast, the X is the only service that operates to East Linton, West Barns and Dunbar. Without the X these communities would be without a regular bus service whilst, as explained, the same is not true of Gullane, Aberlady and Dirleton.A spokesperson for East Coast Buses added: ldquoEast Coast Buses is absolutely committed to delivering for all of our customers in East Lothian.ldquoLike many other transport providers at this time, we are in an extremely challenging recruitment market, which, coupled with our safety protocols for colleagues who find themselves in the Covid- track and trace cycle, means that we are experiencing signicant resourcing dficulties in our driving team on a day-to-day basis.ldquoWith limited available resource, we have made the dficult decision to prioritise key services which provide as many transport links as possible throughout East Lothian. In terms of service provision for Gullane and Aberlady, we have focused on delivering service , which provides critical local links along the coast as well as direct travel to Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"fate-rail-underpass-depends-new-housing-scheme-decision-dunbar","story":"Hundreds of new homes have been built at Hallhill, south of the railway line, in Dunbar in recent years.However, pedestrian links between the new homes and the older section of Dunbar are limited.East Lothian Council is keen to see a new pedestrian underpass to improve connections, which could be financed in part through another housing development in the area.It is expected that the cost of the underpass would be more than pound million, with part of the cost being covered by the Hallhill North development, which would consist of  houses and  flats.A decision is set to be made on the plans, which come from Taylor Wimpey East Scotland and Hallhill Developments Limited, at a meeting of East Lothian Councilrsquos planning committee on Tuesday.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who chairs the local authorityrsquos planning committee and represents Dunbar on East Lothian Council, noted that currently the only pedestrian access in the area was under the railway line beside Hallhill Sports Centre.He said: ldquoAs part of the application, the developer will be making a contribution to a new underpass at the railway.ldquoThere will not be enough funding coming from the developer to completely do this underpass.ldquoThat has to be done through grant funding from other agencies and the council themselves.ldquoAt the moment, all the houses from the Hallhill area to get to both the lower primary school and secondary school have to come underneath the tunnel, and children going to the Lochend Campus have to come back through that one.ldquoIt is really congested and we definitely need another way through there.An underpass was previously in place under the railway line but it was blocked up a number of years ago.Network Rail was approached about seeing it reopened but was not keen on the idea and East Lothian Council would have been liable for the structure.Mr Hampshire said: ldquoWe have to go with a completely new cut-through for pedestrians and cyclists, which will come through into Ash Grove swing park area but will be a safe route to get to the secondary school.Drawings and documents for the planning application were first submitted to East Lothian Councilrsquos planning department at the beginning of February last year.The scheme, to the west of the primary schoolrsquos Lochend Campus, originally featured  houses and  apartments."},{"url":null,"title":"storyteller-tim-porteus-standing-greens-preston-seton-gosford-by-election","story":"The -year-old, from Prestonpans, will also stand for the party in the ward at the full East Lothian Council elections next May.The early years charity worker ndash who writes the weekly Timrsquos Tales column for the Courier ndash works in Midlothian assisting children and families, and lives with his we Kate and three youngest children.Mr Porteus said: ldquoI am standing because I believe my community has amazing assets in its people and beautul natural setting, but we also have our issues that need to be addressed.ldquoI am passionate about education and childrenrsquos wellbeing but, here in East Lothian, we see signicant local issues around education provision and opportunities for our young people.ldquoThey have also been very adversely affected by Covid restrictions.

One was of a man who had died on the bus home from the surgery, where he also had had his ear syringed. The syringing had ruptured a carotid artery aneurysm, causing a massive stroke. The second was in a man who after his ldquojag pushed a loaded wheelbarrow up a steep bank. This stopped his failing heart: the vaccine was irrelevant.In a bizarre third case a coroner blamed a sudden death on our vaccine, given in a factory a few hours before. As a Duphar team had given the injections, we had to investigate. It turned out that the team had sent the man home without vaccinating him, as he had a headache. When we explained this to the coroner he ruled that the death must remain linked to influenza vaccine, as his decision could not be deleted. The three deaths remained on record as linked to vaccine.There are warnings against vaccinating people with egg allergies. As viruses used in vaccines were grown in eggs, it was assumed that even the few molecules of egg protein in each dose might initiate severe anaphylactic reactions in egg-allergic people. Professor Margaret Turner-Warwick, a world-renowned authority on allergies at the time, agreed to assess the risk. She gave  volunteers with severe egg allergy our vaccine under strictly controlled conditions. None of them had the slightest reaction to it. Egg allergy remains a contraindication to the vaccine.Irsquom content that authorities are over-cautious with their warnings about the safety of vaccines, but I hope that my experience will reassure people that they are safer than they are led to believe.Dr Tom Smith, Girvan.STOP PUTTING PROFITS BEFORE PEOPLEIAIN Macwhirter accepts that Covid- cannot be defeated anywhere until it is defeated everywhere yet suggests that we shouldnrsquot be shocked when our governments hoard vaccines . Precisely the opposite is true: such selfishness is short-sighted, self-defeating and it should shock and shame us all.Critically, the solution isnrsquot to choose whether people in the worldrsquos poorest countries should receive their first le-saving dose before or after people in Scotland and other rich countries receive their boosters: the solution is simply to make more vaccines so that everyone, everywhere has access to them, making us all safer.For that to happen, governments like the UKs must end their support for the pharmaceutical monopolies which are holding vaccine recipes and technology hostage by refusing to share them with other qualied manufacturers. The US is already backing action to address this. Billions of pounds of public money funded the development of these vaccines and itrsquos morally repugnant that people are being left to die en masse because of corporate greed.The consequences of the global vaccine shortage are crystal clear: less than three per cent of people in low-income countries are fully vaccinated. Epidemiologists have long warned this will lead to new iants like Omicron threatening lives, vaccine efficacy and fragile economic recoveries in all countries, including in Scotland.The Prime Minister must stop prioritising profits and patents over peoplersquos lives.Jamie Livingstone, Head of Oxfam Scotland, Glasgow.DISMAY AT PARKING DECISIONIT is very disappointing that concerns of local residents and businesses have not been listened to or addressed during the implementation of controlled parking in Glasgow.I suspect that Glasgow City Councilhad already decided upon the outcome of its supposed \"consultation\" well in advance. The only reason I can see why it is pushing through an am-pm seven-day parking zone in many residential parts of Glasgow is to make money, and it is not, as it is claiming, anything to do with providing a better environment for residents or businesses. It was clear that the majority view of locals, including business representatives, was that an am-pm Monday to Friday parking zone would have been much more effective and workable. We were just not listened to.GCC says it will address our concerns in a year. I am not convinced. If it cannot address them now, why should we believe that it will address them in a year We have children, grandchildren and elderly parents. They now have to pay to visit us in the evenings or weekends and worse still, can only stay for a maximum of three hours. This has become a very uncomfortable environment for families and we will leave as soon as we can manage to. Other families might not have an escape route.

I cant see the situation dramatically changing in the next couple of weeks - we have to watch this space...thats genuinely where we are scientically right now.\": Latest Omicron casein Scotland not connected to othersA total of  cases of the Omicron iant have been confirmed in Scotland so far,including at leastnine which are linked and have been traced back to a single private event held on November .It is unclear whether the three confirmedtoday- two in NHS Lanarkshire and one in the Greater Glasgow area- are linked to this event or separate.One caseidentied in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde region, confirmed on Wednesday, was not linked to that event.The Omicron iant was first detected in Botswana in November and appears to be driving a rapid surge in Covid infections in South Africa, with signs that it is overtaking Delta as the dominant strain.There are concerns that its high number of mutations - including  on the spike protein used by the virus to infect cells - could make it more resistant to current vaccines and immunity.There are signs from Public Health Scotland data that the recent fall in Covid cases stopped on November  with a very small increase in positive cases by November If protection against infection is reduced, however, scientists remain confident that vaccines would still provide a strong defence against serious illness or death - as has already been seen following the emergence of the Delta strain.Prof Bauld said: \"I think we should be worried about Omicron because it really, genuinely does look more transmissible.\"We dont know about disease severity or immune escape from the vaccines, but we have confidence that eventhe vaccines are weakened in terms of transmission and infection that they will still work in terms of saving peoples lives basically. Even these current vaccines that we have.\"So I am worried, but Im not saying that these vaccines are useless - theyre still working and will still work, evennot as well, against Omicron.\": Abnormal spike in neonatal deaths not linked to Covid in mothers orbabiesProf Bauld told podcast listeners that it was \"absolutely imminent\" that boosters will be added to Scotlands vaccine passport apps, allowing people travelling abroad to show that they have had a third jag.Some countries are now requesting proof of boosters for entry as part of border controls, or for access into leisure and hospitality venues.However, Prof Bauld said she was not in favour of tougher rules on arrivals into the UK.The Scottish Government has asked Westminster to consider extending home self-isolation to eight days for travellers arriving from non-red list countries, with people only able to end self-isolationthey test negative for Covid on a PCR test taken on day eight.Currently, all arrivals have to take a PCR test within two days of entering the UK and remain in isolation until they receive a negative result.Prof Bauld said this was \"proportionate\".She added: \"Im really hopeful that we dont go in that direction [eight-day self-isolation] unless we absolutely have to.\"The main reason for that is that when you see domestic spread of this iant, then thinking about travel as the main source becomes less of an issue.\"Its too early to tellthat would occur - governments arent ruling it out - but its not the plan at the moment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive accessas we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive pound for two months offer here.From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expectground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content ndash as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just pound for two monthshere.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as ldquounsatisfactory on pollution, according to data from the ScottishEnvironmentProtection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oilcompanies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as ldquovery poor in .

As the trust’s chairman Dan Wise explained, it is essentially an underwater drone.He said: “This small unit will allow us to continue our collaborative research into the Orkney skate population. More specically, we will be able to get eyes underwater to look for essential fish habitat such as egg case laying grounds, nursery areas etc.“We can cover more ground with this drone when compared to ing, and the quality of the camera is greater when compared to a drop down camera – both survey styles we still do but this is another tool in the tool box.”RSPB Scotland is also going to invest in new machinery, with its £, award going to the purchase of a specialist tractor for removing vegetation.A tractor equipped with Soucy tracks will be used to cut and collect material for removal from the sites, without leaving rutted tracks or creating erosion points. This machine has signicantly less ground pressure than a normal tractor, reducing the chances of damaging sensitive habitats, and is specically designed to operate in softer ground conditions.The benefits to birdle include opening up foraging habitat, allowing flightless chicks to move around more easily, and reducing the chance of chicks becoming saturated in dense, wet vegetation.RSPB Scotland site manager in Orkney, Alan Leitch, said:“The funding means we can purchase machinery that offers us a real opportunity to upscale our annual land management efforts on the Orkney nature reserves to increase conservation benefits. These operations will help a suite of species including curlews, lapwings, and hen harriers.”The £m fund was launched in July this year and has now been extended to a total of at least £m over the next five years. On the fund in general, the Bioersity Minister, Lorna Slater, said:“Too much of Scotland’s natural environment is degraded after years of over-exploitation, but this government is committed to restoring nature and our wildle. The Nature Restoration Fund will play a big role in delivering these aspirations, and the projects we are funding today are just the beginning.#The fund kick starts a new approach, supporting longer-term, larger, landscape-scale projects across Scotland # on land and at sea # that address the twin crises of bioersity loss and climate change. Over this parliament we will invest at least £ million through the fund, delivering real change that people and nature will benefit from across the whole country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney. Casey Construction Ltd. was awarded the contract to carry out the essential maintenance work and improvements.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":null,"title":"closing of schools must be avoided says childrens commissioner koulla yiasouma","story":"Koulla Yiasouma.

Mark BainTwitterEmailDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailSchools have been urged to avoid further closures at all costs with children having already missed too much time out of the classroom due to the Covid pandemic.The call comes from the Commissioner for Children and Young People, who said all avenues must be explored so sending pupils home from school does not become normal practice.Some schools are already preparing new timetables to begin after Christmas, having warned parents that many children will face days off as the number of staff off through Covid-related issues continues to rise across Northern Ireland, saying the situation has become a serious health and safety concern.“We should not be in a position where whole classes or year groups are learning from home because of staff shortages, as is the case in some schools,” said Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma.“That situation is untenable and urgent intervention is needed so that children receive the education they have the right to.“I welcome some of the suggestions already offered to make sure this does not become the norm, such as calling in retired teachers and redeploying teachers that are not currently working in schools.“Some older children are undertaking both mock and full GCSEs. Many children, of all ages, are only now beginning to settle back into education in the classroom.I know that school staff, unions, the Education Authority and the minister all agree that further school closures must be avoided at all costs and I urge them all to make every effort, including exploring the above suggestions, to ensure that this intolerable pressure on some schools is alleviated and our children do not have their education further disrupted.“My ‘New and Better Normal’ Report highlighted the impact of school closures on children and yet again our children and young people are anxious about their education and the services that they receive in school. Closing of schools must be avoided, the impact is much too serious for our children and young people.”Read MoreNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time schoolAll this week, schools have been reporting severe staffing issues, with principals unable to secure substitute teachers off the NISTR register, which all substitute teachers must be registered on in Northern Ireland.Some schools are making over  telephone calls a day to get classes covered, with over , teachers absent through Covid related issues in the last four weeks and the numbers rising every day.Helena Macormac, director of the National Association of Head Teachers, called on the Department of Education to expand the register for substitute teachers to help alleviate the situation.“We want to see them perhaps encouraging recently retired teachers to come back or incentivising teachers which are within other areas of the system, and asking them toto teaching,” she said.“There needs to be clear messaging from the department for parents and pupils and to let them know their school may be faced with this situation.”Teaching union the NASUWT added: “We are in this situation because teachers and support staff are catching Covid. Until a serious effort is made to stop the spread of Covid, more students will be sent home. At all costs, this has to be the first priority.“This means stopping all mass gatherings in schools now. Why are some schools still holding open days and parents’ evenings  Why are teachers kept on site after children have gone home for meetings ”The Department continues to urge schools to reinforce guidance available from the Public Health Agency, and said there remain no plans to introduce a series of circuit breaker school closures ahead of Christmas.“Departmental guidance requires schools to continue to implement a range of mitigations to reduce the risk of Covid- transmission including: cleaning, ventilation, face coverings, consistent groups and regular asymptomatic testing using lateral flow devices for all staff and post-primary pupils. Vaccination is available to all staff and some students.“Anyone displaying any of the key Covid- symptoms must not attend school.

Today we have  teachers off. That equates to a quarter of our teaching staff.“Like all schools we have tried in earnest to secure substitute teachers to fill these positions to no avail. We have on several occasions, contacted over  subs on a given day to try to secure cover.“I have discussed the situation with the chair of Governors and we feel that we may have to go down the route that other post primaries are taking and ask that certain year groups stay at home on certain days.“We will be putting a plan in place in the new year. This is certainly not something we want to do and we have worked hard to avoid this so far this term but the situation is such that the measures we have in place are not sustainable with the current level of absence.”Helena Macormac, director of the National Association of Head Teachers, said contingency plans need to be in place, but we do not want to see a circuit breaker”. We would prefer itthat could be avoided, but safety has to be paramount. Be prepared is what we’re saying, but we really don’t want this to happen,” she added.But she added that “ there are not the substitute teachers in the system, then schools cannot open safely.”The Department of Education said: “There are no plans to close schools early for the Christmas period. Any decision to do so would be taken by the Executive and would be based on medical and scientic advice.

She has also separately raised issues with her employer.The statement from Ms Donaghy’s solicitor said she is “deeply concerned” about “systemic leakage of confidential Council decision making to the media and other third parties”.“The latest instance of such leaks relates to a password protected confidential email communication sent to Councillors confirming a decision on her suspension,” KRW Law added.“Within a very short time of her receiving formal correspondence about her suspension the decision was posted on social media.”The statement added that throughout this situation “she has retained her dignity in the face of often heavy media intrusion into her family and private le”.“To date there has been zero accountability on the part of the Council on the manner in which it has conducted itself on a series of issues all of which are the subject of pending disciplinary and other proceedings,” it added.Mid and East Antrim Borough Council said in a statement: “We do not comment on staffing matters and no inference should be drawn from this.”Most ReadThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time schoolLegal first in NI after Co Down man convicted of publishing photo of judge sitting in courtSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in England‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’Top VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayReformed former prisoner Rosie Bradley creates artwork for north Belfast cross-community boxing clubLatest Northern IrelandNI high street voucher: , people still waiting for cardDeadline for legislating on legacy issues has been missed, Brandon Lewis saysJamie Dornan and Sir Kenneth Branagh to be honoured at Oscar Wilde AwardsMore issues than medicines need addressing in Brexit protocol – DonaldsonVaccination programme passes % landmark in Northern IrelandLatestPeople can snog who they wish, Javid says‘Lady of house’ Ghislaine Maxwell told Epstein staff ‘not to look in his eyes’NI high street voucher: , people still waiting for cardPolice seek three men after antisemitic attack on Hanukkah party busEuropean clubs seek urgent FIFA talks over Africa Cup of Nations safety concerns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Matt Alexander PA WireEimear McGovernTwitterEmailDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA Belfast-based group of artists and activists called Array Collective, the winners of the  Turner Prize, have said their \"complex love story\" with the city theyve made their home tells the story behind their work.Emma Campbell, a member of the group, said they are completely buzzing to have won the prize in a ceremony on Wednesday night and become the first Northern Ireland winners in the history of the prestigious Tate-sponsored award.The collective, consisting of  members, will take home a £, prize and haven#t decided what they will do with the funds yet but it may have to go towards a new studio space after they were informed theirs, on King Street in the city, would be redeveloped.It#s poignant given a large part of their politically-themed work is protesting against gentrication.Read MoreTurner Prize winner announced after collectives dominate shortlistMs Campbell, who uses photography to express herself artistically, said they had no clue they had been nominated for the prize until they learned the news during lockdown.We had no cue about the prize and we found out in the middle of lockdown, so we had to get everybody together on a Zoom call to share the news. I manically texted everyone who thought the studio was on fire, she said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The prize was announced at a ceremony at Coventry Cathedral and Array Collective, consisting of Sighle Bhreathnach-Cashell, Sinead Bhreathnach-Cashell, Jane Butler, Alessia Cargnelli, Mitch Conlon, Clodagh Lavelle, Grace McMurray, Stephen Millar, Laura O#Connor, Thomas Wells and Ms Campbell, travelled over for the ceremony.The group met as friends first and then organically became a collective, meeting at the protests that are central for the group whose message is absolutely political. Ms Campbell said: People started approaching us to help them with banner-making workshops or arranging something for anti-gentrication. The opportunity of the Turner Prize, we thought the spotlight would be really useful for the things we care about.Their work includes the creation of a shebeen, adorned in banners advocating reproductive rights. The goal, according to the group, was to create “a place to gather outside the sectarian ides.Ms Campbell said: The canopy in the shebeen is made up of actual protest banners that we#ve used. It is now on full display at the official prize exhibition at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum.It was a strong year for collectives, with four other artist groups - Black Obsidian Sound System, Cooking Sections, Gentle Radical, and Project Art Works - also up for the award, the first time that the pool of nominees was made up of entirely of collectives.The judges decided this year to only shortlist collectives because of the times we#re in, said Ms Campbell. A lot of people needed to be in a collective to be able to sustain an artistic practice. Last night, they said the collectives were chosen because of the artistic work we continued to do throughout lockdown, uplting the communities we#re involved in. Collective practice has always happened in art but large institutions tend to shy away from it because it makes things more complex.The form of a collective is so necessary because it allows some people to step back when needed, such as two of the members who have recently had new babies, said Ms Campbell. It also helps people from working class backgrounds continue to work in the sector.The precarious nature of that sector means they will soon have to move on from their studio space, which they found out shortly after being nominated for the prize. We found out just after we nominated that we#ve only got another  months before ours get turned into some sort of developer#s offices or something like that.We#ve been there for decades now, so it will be sad to leave the building but Dublin is exactly the same. People get moved around quickly and there#s not enough residential housing, never mind artists studios, she said.Ms Campbell added: We#re a collective that does a lot of protest and rally work, so it#s important for us to be in the centre of Belfast because sometimes you don#t hear about a protest until a couple of hours beforehand.After the win was announced, SDLP MP Claire Hanna said Array Collective#s achievement shows the importance of supporting local artists.She called on the Department for Communities to explore further funding opportunities for the arts, to allow local talents to thrive and reach their full potential.Ms Hanna said: Unfortunately the sector is chronically underfunded, the lowest levels on this island, pushing many people out of the sector and leaving others exhausted by chasing small amounts of funding. The pandemic, and the loss of audiences, has compounded existing problems.Ms Campbell said as a collective, they are aware the Department for Communities has had real dficulty funding the arts directly.Things that are called cultural get funded that maybe shouldn#t be funded. We#re political in the sense that we try to act against those things. We#ve managed to survive despite this real lack of funding but it#s really tiring and exhausting to always have to sustain yourselves, she said.We#ve all got at least one or two jobs. There#s no way you could sustain yourself as an artist just through that work. Most of us work in the community or voluntary sector or in arts and heritage, all famously not very well paid.Judges of the Turner Prize praised the group for addressing social and political issues in Northern Ireland, and for translating their activism into artwork.Array Collective#s group is contextual, said Ms Campbell. It#s about us being from Belfast and existing in Belfast, it has eleven members and not everyone is from the north – and we’ve all worked abroad as well - but everybody has made Northern Ireland their home. We all bring a bit of a fresh perspective but we have a complex love story with Belfast.”The Department for Communities has been asked for a response. Related topicsDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Department for Communities PremiumMinister to ask Stormont to stump up more money for troubled Casement Park projectPublic is asked for its views on £m Queen’s Quay proposal PremiumStormont ministers attend events despite their work from home message PremiumPIP firm Capita to be paid over £m after contract extension PremiumHundreds waiting over two years for Personal Independence Payment appeal hearingMost ReadThomas Garfield Gilmour: Only man convicted of sectarian killing of three Quinn brothers dies suddenlyNI pupils told: Prepare for part-time schoolLegal first in NI after Co Down man convicted of publishing photo of judge sitting in courtSammy Wilson slammed for ‘distasteful ding dong’ tweet as DUP MPs vote against rules to combat Omicron in England‘Mark Simpson, BBC News, in the freezing cold water at Helen’s Bay...’Top VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayVideo: Middle class madam Anglea Cosgrave - brothel queen behind one of Northern Ireland’s biggest prostitution ringsPlayReformed former prisoner Rosie Bradley creates artwork for north Belfast cross-community boxing clubLatest Northern IrelandNI high street voucher: , people still waiting for cardDeadline for legislating on legacy issues has been missed, Brandon Lewis saysJamie Dornan and Sir Kenneth Branagh to be honoured at Oscar Wilde AwardsMore issues than medicines need addressing in Brexit protocol – DonaldsonVaccination programme passes % landmark in Northern IrelandLatestPeople can snog who they wish, Javid says‘Lady of house’ Ghislaine Maxwell told Epstein staff ‘not to look in his eyes’NI high street voucher: , people still waiting for cardPolice seek three men after antisemitic attack on Hanukkah party busEuropean clubs seek urgent FIFA talks over Africa Cup of Nations safety concerns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But the only thing is just – there’s guidance already out there – just be cautious and enjoy yourselves.”On Wednesday, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told ITV’s Peston programme that “we should all be trying to enjoy the Christmas ahead of us”.But she said “snogging under the mistletoe” should be avoided with “people you don’t already know”.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer earlier said: “I don’t think it’s the role of Government to dictate who people can kiss or not kiss, and I was quite surprised to see that suggestion come out of Government.“I think it just demonstrates how they’resixes and ninesthat’s what they’re now discussing.”The discussion comes after reports of Christmas parties being cancelled amid concern over the Omicron iant of coronavirus.But the Prime Minister said on Thursday it was unnecessary to cancel holiday events or for people to change their behaviour, outside of the new measures set out on mask-wearing and self-isolation.Earlier, business minister George Freeman said he hadn’t been kissed under the mistletoe “for years”.Speaking to LBC he said: “We’re trying not to tell everyone who they should kiss or where they should go.“I think Therese Coffey was making the point that we’re all going to have to exercise some common sense and I think the British public know that, in the end, it is up to all of us.“If we can prevent the virus from spreading, we’ll all be able to enjoy more freedoms and that’s why we have taken the steps we have.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

It opened earlier this week and seeks to gain insights from stakeholders and the wider public on the best way to shape and develop the rail network across Ireland. Mr Durkan has encouraged local people and businesses to have their say by responding to the consultation. He said: “This public consultation is an exciting opportunity for everyone to have their say on the future of rail provision across Ireland. “This island once had a thriving railway network and since coming into office SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has committed to exploring an expanded railway network, which has the potential to be transformative for communities across our island. “The benefits of an overhaul of our current railway network are clear, it would allow us to address the regional imbalances that exist across the island, making our communities better connected and making rail a real option for people who regularly travel for work, to visit friends and family and to socialise. “It would also bring a boost for our economy, with poor public transport links regularly cited as a reason for the lack of investment outside our population centres. “More public transport options would also take more cars off our roads, which is a key part of plans to tackle the climate crisis and protect our environment. “I welcome SDLP Minister Mallon’s work on progressing this project so far and hope this public consultation marks the next step in making the revolution of our island’s rail network a reality. “I know this an issue many people in Derry feel very passionate about and would urge them not to miss this unique opportunity to give their view. “While other political parties are busy politicking, the SDLP is focused on delivering for people. After almost  years of Sinn Feacutein-DUP joint Government, the public deserve delivery. We’re up for the job.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

The survey found Northern Ireland to be the most charitable UK region, with more than three-quartersagreeing that it is better to give gts than to receive them. Eileen Wilson, Food Services Manager at Footprints, Northern Ireland, a partner of national food distribution charityFareSharesaid: “Christmas does bring extra challenges for people close to poverty or struggling with mental health. “Expenses go up this time of year. Not just trying to buy food and gts, but also heating in winter.” A campaign organised by the Big Give and backed by celebrities such as Stephen Fry, Dame Judi Dench, Russell Brandand others is aiming to help. The Big Give Christmas Challenge is the UK’s biggest Christmas coordinated fundraising appeal, supporting over  charities to raise funds with the unique offer of matching any donations made during the week of November  to December . This gives thehundreds of participating charities the opportunity to have their donations doubled. Alex Day, Director of The Big Give said: “Our study shows that, sadly, people across Great Britain and Northern Ireland are facing an imperfect storm high fuel prices, chronic mental health problems, rising debt, loneliness and fears about Covid- will mean that, for many, this festive period will be a far cry from picture perfect scenes portrayed on Christmas cards. “Some will rely on charities which will be further and further stretched as demand grows. “That is why, for those who can, supporting charities is more important than ever. Through The Christmas Challenge campaign, we are offering to match any donation made to hundreds of amazing charities throughtheBigGive.org.ukThat means whatever you can give will go twice as far.” The Christmas Challenge consists of many dferent charities, from small local organisations to large international charities. All the charities help those that need it most including refugees, children, older people and animals. The Christmas Challenge was launched in  by Sir Alec Reed, founder of Reed Recruitment. Last year, the campaign raised pound.m for  charities.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . -- related_article   n n  n n nAs Daniel ODonnells th birthday approaches he considers winding down a little n n n n n\".

My whole le came to a halt.Derry Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch aims to raise more awareness and funds for an “illness we don’t talk about enough” Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseReporter: Nicole Lang Dec   addthis, Leslie Hill was sadly diagnosed with Parkinsons disease in April . googletag.cmd.push Parkinsons disease is a condition that affects the brain. It causes problems like shaking and stfness that get worse over time. The main symptoms of the disease are shaking, slow movements and stfness. Treatments for Parkinsons disease include therapies to help with movement problems, medicines and sometimes brain surgery. Parkinsons disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. It’s not yet clear exactly why this happens. Leslie’s first symptoms were shown in his handwriting when it was still neat but very small. Then, in January , the -year-old, was getting ready to go to the dentist when his left hand would not move to brush his teeth. Leslie said: “After several attempts to brush my teeth, I realised something wasnt right. I contacted my GP and was sent to the hospital to do tests. “I was kept in for five days and had numerous tests. It was then that I was diagnosed. My whole le came to a halt. “Shortly after, I became a member of Parkinsons Foyle branch. I really enjoyed and appreciated the support that I got. “I helped to organise events and helped with fundraising. I was a committee member within six months and then I was asked to become Chairman. “It is and was such an honour, I was very pleased to be voted in. I have a vice chairman, Jackie Brolly. “There is a committee of  dedicated members, nothing is a bother to them. My we Rhonda is the secretary and Wendy Stuart is treasurer. “We have approximately  members and we are all one big family. “I have been acting Chairman since September  and officially since March . During my time as Chairman, we have given approximatelyfive to six thousand pounds every year to Parkinson’s research.” Parkinson’s Foyle Branch is a self-funded charity and they depend on the generosity of members of the public to keep the branch going. Their mission is ‘Together we will find a cure, and improve le for everybody affected by Parkinson’s.’ Leslie continued: “We’re close to major breakthroughs. Funding the right research into the most promising treatments, we get closer to a cure every day. “Until then, were here for everyone affected by Parkinson’s. Fighting for fair treatment and better services. Making everyone see its real impact. “People with Parkinson’s, scientists and supporters, fundraisers and families, carers and clinicians, all working side by side. “We are impatient for change, we’re taking a stand, speaking out, chipping in, and playing our part. “I cannot thank the members of the public enough as they have been tremendous. We also organise events with the money we receive to help Parkinson’s patients. “This includes dancing to music, exercise classes, massage and reflexology classes, yoga and many more as exercise is a good medicine for Parkinsons sufferers. “In the month of March, we hold our Annual General Meeting. Then, from April to December, we have monthly meetings. “At our meetings,we have  plus members and carers and we have a guest at every one of them. “Our meetings came to a halt in March  due to the Covid pandemic, the whole world had stopped due to this deadly virus. “With our dedicated committee members, we rang round all of our members and kept in touch. The Mayor of Derry and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke is attending the Foyle Branch’s Christmas Dinner on Friday December  to celebrate all the member’s efforts during this dficult period. Leslie concluded: “I want to speak about and raise awareness for Parkinson’s because you don’t see a lot about it on the news and not many people know about this illness but, together, we will beat Parkinson’s.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements.

The Foyle MP will formally move the second reading of his Climate Emergency and Green Jobs Bill which aims to bring forward the date by which the British Government must achieve net-zero emissions to . Climate Change is the greatest threat our world faces, and we have ten days to legislate to save our planet. On th Dec, I’m bringing my Climate Change Bill to the Commons with progressive ideas to do our part to arrest the slide into climate catastrophe. #ClimateChangeBill pic RDOeSu     — Colum Eastwood December ,     The Bill also places a duty on Government Ministers to bring forward proposals for a corporate green levy on large businesses to resource climate action. Eastwood said global leaders have failed to grasp the chance to take action on climate change. “Over the last number of months, senior British Government Ministers have been at pains to establish their green credentials ahead of and during the COP conference in Glasgow, he said. While global leaders failed to grasp the real opportunity to take the bold action needed to prevent climate breakdown, the commitments made over that fortnight were substantial.  A unique opportunity - Irish public invited to share views on all-island rail network    Now Conservative Ministers have the opportunity to prove that Glasgow wasn’t all hot air and grandstanding for the world’s media. “The Bill I have produced alongside environmental leaders would signal a step change in this government’s attitude toward climate action and demonstrate that this is an emergency. I am proposing bringing forward the date by which net-zero emissions must be achieved to , introducing the first legislative climate emergency declaration and seeking the introduction of a new corporate green levy recognising that the burden for paying for climate rehabilitation should fall on those companies that have done the most damage. “Passing this Bill would be the first real demonstration that this government acknowledges that the house is on fire and we need to do something about it now. This legislation is radical because we cannot afford to be timid in the face of an emergency like this. I hope that political leaders will commit themselves to it in the days ahead.”  Foyle MLA Delargy accuses Poots of dithering on climate change     *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  One hundred years ago this week, the Anglo-Irish Treaty to determine the future of Ireland and its relationship with the United Kingdom was signed at Downing Street after tense negotiation. The final outcome would have profound consequences for the city of Derry who would find itself relegated to border town status once the creation of the Northern Irish state loyal to the UK had been established. The Irish negotiators in London were Arthur Grfiths, Michael Collins, Robert Barton, Eamonn Duggan and George Gavan Duffy. On the British side was David Lloyd George, Lord Birkenhead, Austen Chamberlain, Winston Churchill, Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, Sir Gordon Hewart and Sir Hamar Greenwood. What followed was the creation of the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. The British would also retain use of three ports – Berehaven and Spike Island in the south and Lough Swilly in Co. Donegal. A common assumption was this Treaty resulted in the partition of Ireland with six counties being formed as Northern Ireland and would remain part of the United Kingdom. However, partition had already been put into place on paper with the Government of Ireland Act in  with it taking effect on May , . All the Anglo-Irish Treaty did was give the devolved, and predominantly unionist government of Northern Ireland the option to opt out of being part of the new Irish Free State – which they duly exercised. But partition was not an idea born out of a hurried idea to provide a compromised or botched solution to the Irish Question. As Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University reveals, the seeds of it had been sown long before Michael Collins sat down to negotiate with Lloyd George. He said: “One hundred years ago, the issue of partition was on everyones minds in Derry and the North West. “It was first mentioned in the nineteenth century as a solution to, what was called at the time, The Irish Question – the idea that Ireland would be self-governing. “Obviously there was major opposition to that in Ulster from the unionist population. So the idea that partition may be a solution with Ulster being under Westminsters control while the rest of Ireland would be under a Dublin government really began to have an affect on Derry in the early part of the twentieth century. “Especially around the years  and  when Ulster unionism began to mobilise physically in terms of protests, the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Forceand the signing of the Ulster Covenant. “That really had a major impact on the North West – and Derry in particular. There was an eleven-year period then from  to  where partition was in the position that kind of like Brexit is today in that in the last five years or so it was the only thing that people were thinking about. “It did have an acute effect on Derry – particularly around  and , Derry was the centre of attention for the partition question because it was seen as the place most likely to see violence emerge as a result of those political discussions. “But of course everything changed following the outbreak of the First World War. After the war, isions became even more entrenched and violence became a reality instead of just a prospect.” While the British Government continued to hesitate over Home Rule for Ireland, Republican volunteers took matters into their own hands in  by launching the Easter Rising. Ultimately, this attempt to win independence from the British failed and the rebellion was crushed. However, the question of self-determination did not end with the execution of the risings leaders and a growing political force by the name of Sinn Feacutein more than made its mark with a stunning performance at the  General Election. The party went from only having six seats to  – including the constituency of Derry City. Dr Grant added: “The thing about the Derry parliamentary seat is that it was a swing seat – a bit like today with the Fermanagh and South Tyrone Westminster seat. “The Derry City seat was so contentious because most men had a vote in parliamentary elections but not in local elections – an issue that remained controversial right up to the early s. “With the parliamentary vote, nationalists and unionists were evenly split in terms of the voting rights in the city. So election results tended to go unionist-nationalist-unionist-nationalist throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century. “So it wasnt a huge surprise when Sinn Feacutein won it in . But at the same time, it was always very close and there was huge media attention on it because it was so close. “The big thing in  was that the Irish Parliamentary Partyand Sinn Feacutein made a pact in Ulster that meant Derry was kind of pre-decided almost for Sinn Feacutein. “The IPP pulled back and gave Sinn Feacutein a free run at Derry but they would have got free runs themselves where such as West Belfast for example when Sinn Feacutein pulled out there. “Cardinal Michael Logue – who was the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland – brokered a pact between Sinn Feacutein and the IPP as they were afraid that they would knock each other out in seats like Derry and West Belfast and let the Unionists in to sweep up the seats.”  Read more: When unionists lost control of Derry Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  With Sinn Feacuteins electoral success in the Derry City seat in  General Election, nationalists turned their eyes on local government. The running of affairs within Derry had been in the control of Protestants Unionists since the days of when King James II unsuccessfully laid siege to the city in . However, the introduction of a proportional electoral system for council elections had been introduced prior to the  local government poll – the result of which was seismic for Derry. A coalition of Sinn Feacutein, the Nationalist Party and an independent Nationalist councillor, Hugh ODoherty, won control of Derry Council from the Unionists by just two seats with ODoherty himself being appointed Mayor of the city. Not surprisingly, the result caused resentment amongst the Protestant and unionist community which spiralled into the Derry riots of June . Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “The riots of  in the city are interesting in that while partition had been on peoples minds, serious violence had not occurred in the city since  .   “The  election was signicant in that it was a landslide for Sinn Feacutein and the whole country changed politically. So there was a fear on the part of unionists of an independent Ireland. “But to my mind, the most signicant thing was the  local elections in January of that year. “The unionist minority in Derry had held control of the city since the siege in . So theyve had two hundred or so years of dominance. “Because of the introduction of proportional representation, for the first time ever, the nationalists and Sinn Feacutein took control over local government after winning a combined majority of just two. “That in turn meant the Mayor of Derry, Hugh ODoherty, was both a nationalist and the first Catholic to hold that position since . So that was a hugely signicant and symbolic event because it meant that control of local government had been taken out of the hands of unionists and into those of nationalists. “That was hugely important politically because all of the conversation in ,  and into  was about would there be partition  andthat was to happen, where would the line be drawn . “If Derry Corporation was under nationalist control, then the propaganda victory and the moral argument would have tipped the balance towards the argument that Derry should be a Free State city rather than a Northern Irish one. “So unionists were very nervous and scared of their futures because of those signicant changes that took place. Weekend by weekend throughout the year, there was violence, rioting and fighting in the streets that became more and more intense. “You had events in the south with IRA attacks and counter-attacks from the Black and Tans that made things in Derry even more intense and then it all kicked off one night in June . “It spiralled from the Diamond into the Fountain area followed by a counter-attack from the Bogside and by the end of the week, there were twenty people dead – a really, really terrible week in the citys history.”  Read more: Derry the centre of attention in Partition question Ground shts away from Derrys nationalists as Partition lines are drawn up    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

This week marks the centenary of The Anglo-Irish Treaty that would see Derry in a precarious position in its bid to be part of the new Irish Free StateReporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, This week marks the th anniversary of the signing of The Anglo-Irish Treaty. In the first of a two-part series, Matthew Leslie speaks to Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University to examine le in Derry before the Treaty had been signed. googletag.cmd.push  The riots that took place in Derry in  eventually came to a close but tensions in the city were still on a powderkeg. While Sinn Feacutein held the Derry City Westminster constituencyand a Nationalist coalition in control of both the citys Council and the Mayors office, events where would decide the future of Derrys fortunes. Partition of the Ireland had been an idea since the nineteenth century but it became a reality late in  with the Government of Ireland Act. The bill meant that six of Irelands counties would form the state of Northern Ireland to be run by a devolved – and predominantly unionist – administration in Belfast. May  saw the enforcement of the Act and it left Derry cut off from the rest of Ireland – especially from the trade it had with neighbouring Co. Donegal. Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University said: “Partition – on paper – took place as a result of the Government of Ireland Act in . That piece of legislation allowed for the creation of two separate parliaments of two politically jurisdictions – Northern Ireland in the six counties and Southern Ireland in the  counties. “Northern Ireland was founded with the unionist political establishment ran the legislation to establish a parliament, set up a police force and put into place the whole mechanisms of a government.  Dr Adrian Grant of Ulster University  “Whereas in the south, the whole concept of there being a Southern Ireland never really took hold because it wasnt accepted by nationalists or Sinn Feacuteiners as a solution to the issue. “So essentially, the Government of Ireland Act was just ignored. The Southern Irish parliament was never founded which meant the  counties were in a state of limbo while Northern Ireland was being founded. “It was only when the Treaty negotiations took place that the concept of the Free State of Ireland came into play. “Though it had taken place on paper, actual partition didnt take place until after the Free State had been founded. “With the partition on paper, the news of that did not go down well at all with Derrys nationalist community. “I think that once that happened, it was just a matter for them to try and keep their heads down and use the power that they had gained in the local elections earlier in  to try and argue for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “There was a twin-strategy. The ultimate outcome would be a united Ireland that was independent – whether it would be a republic or not would be another point. There was a feeling that the IRA and Sinn Feacutein could achieve their aims and there would be no worries about partition and treat it asit was something to be ignored. “Others probably more realistically thought that partition was going to happen whatever the outcome was. For those nationalists and republicans, their strategy was to argue forcefully in the press and in the political circles for Derry to be included in the southern jurisdiction. “They went out mapping, interviewing people throughout the potential border area to ask their opinion on where they would like to reside and put out the message that Derry was a nationalist city and should not be included in Northern Ireland. “They also wanted to keep control of local government so they could continue to make that point.” While nationalists in Derry went about arguing their case, Michael Collins himself was planning a campaign of destabilisation to collapse the new Northern Ireland and have Derry and the North within the Free States fold. However, events close to home would prevent that. A turn that would have profound consequences on Derry for decades to come.  The second and final part of “Derry and the Anglo-Irish Treaty”, will be in next Mondays edition of The Derry News on December .

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, st December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry rugby player sells car after being caught driving at mph overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMaiden flight jets off on new City of Derry route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: TV personality Mark Wright visits Dormans  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Limavady Magistrates Court.Local NewsCounty Derry woman urinated on womans doorstep before assaulting her overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Murder victim Edward Meenan.Derry NewsJury dismissed in Derry murder trial overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, nd December,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Leslie Hill, Chairman of Parkinsons Foyle Branch, along with members, are raising funds and awareness for Parkinsons diseaseDerry News“It was then that I was diagnosed.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,. A crowdfunding page has brought in poundK so far and Ballinderry are aiming to help raise the remainder. On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

He’s been here before which always helps as well, and he will bring plenty of ideas and energy to the club. “We are comfortable with where we are in our preparations for the new season and are looking forward to getting going again in the coming weeks. ”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Step back in time to Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Down Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derry Citys Brandywell Pride Supporters Club night of celebration in the Oakgrove Bar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

The Greencastle native played at the Brandywell between - and became one of the most beloved players in the club’s history in that time. After bursting onto the scene with a hat trick against Limerick in the promotion  relegation semi-finals in , Mark really came into his own following the arrival of Stephen Kenny a year later. Forming a lethal partnership with Gary Beckett, Mark was the lead goalscorer in one of the club’s most successful periods in the League of Ireland era, with City becoming a household name across Ireland and Europe in  and . Forced to retire due to a brain tumour, Mark scored the winning goal to hand Derry City the First Division title in what was supposed to be his final game for the club on a memorable and emotional night in Monaghan in . However, showing incredible fighting spirit, Mark ed to break Liam Coyle’s long-standing goal record with a hat trick against Mervue United in the FAI Cup in  to stand alone as the club’s most lethal hitman since entering the League of Ireland. Mark then moved to Glenavon before he was forced to retire again in , and he spent the next few years battling his illness alongside his family and we Terri before tragically passing away in , aged , after a brave battle with cancer.  Incredible le ‘The Love of the Game’ tells Mark’s story through the eyes of those who knew him best, and those who shared those precious moments with him on his journey through an incredible le. From his wicked sense of humour, to his hopes, fears and his amazing refusal to give up in the most dficult of circumstances, the story of Mark’s le is inspiring, hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure. “Mark signied everything that was good about the human spirit,” Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny says. “He was such a good person. I just loved his warmth, his humility and his smile and laughter around the group. “It was an amazing period and Mark Farren was our goal scorer. He was the player who scored the most goals. He was our first defender, our first line of attack who chased down every lost cause. He was prolic, he was quick, he was dynamic, he was skillful, he was inventive and he could score all types of goals. He could chip the goalkeeper, he could go around the keeper easily with his speed and control and he had a venomous left foot and accurate so he could score any type of goal.”  ‘Big goals’ Derry City manager Ruaidhri Higgins remembers Mark as the man for the big occasion. “He scored in cup finals, he scored on final days of the season Mark always scored in big games and big moments and always scored against the top teams as well,” he said. “You get lads who score lots of goals but they punish the lesser teams, whereas Mark scored a lot of big goals in big games and when you do that you are a hell of a player.” “When I signed for Bohemians, the likes of Jason McGuinness and Brian Shelley and Owen Heary always commented on how much they hated playing against Mark Farren. These are top players sometimes you can take your own team mates and players for granted, but that coming from opposition players who have won the lot, and for other players who constantly talk about Mark Farren highlights how good he was.” Former teammate Paddy McCourt rates Mark as one of the finest finishers he ever played alongside. “When I think of Mark Farren, the first thing that comes to mind is goals,” he added. “He was a ruthless finisher. He was a quiet, unassuming fella off the pitch, with a very dry but witty sense of humour. I always found him good company. He was quite happy to be in the background and be funny. “We had a lot of big characters in the dressing room at the time, so Mark would have been a quieter type of funny. He would have been happy to be playing pranks on people and joking about. I always found him really funny. He was just a great lad who loved being a footballer for Derry City. “I have been fortunate to play international football, I have been fortunate to play with some big clubs, but it was very rare in that time that I played with someone, who,they went through one on one, I was as confident as I was when I seen Mark Farren go through one on one. The goals that he got for Derry City speak volumes about that being true.” ‘The Love of the Game’ will be released in the coming days, with details of the launch set to come.

With  minutes played, the Maghera side trailed their Antrim counterparts by - to - and looked to be fading into the December chill. However, Thomas McKeagneys nd effort got St Pats moving again, and they had closed the gap to five points at the second half water break. When James Friels th minute free dropped straight to the net, it left just the minimum between the sides and Maghera outscored Garron Tower by - to - in the final ten minutes to take the spoils. The defeated St Killians side. The Derry men had started brightly too, and a Callum OKane brace had them - to - up after just five minutes, but a magnicent double save from Odhran McElhinney proved a warning for St Pats. Two huge frees from Joseph McLaughlin got St Killians off the mark, and after Niall McGarrell had put them ahead on  minutes, McLaughlins third gave them a - to - lead at the water break. Well in the ascendency, Garron Tower were swaggering, and hit three points in as many minutes from McLaughlin , Cormac McKeown and Niall McGarrell to extend the lead to five points. James Friel hit back with two long range frees, but a long range Padraig McKillop effort in stoppage time saw St Killians lead by - to - at the break. The Antrim side continued where they left off in the second half, another brace of McLaughlin frees and a McGarrell effort opening up a seven-point lead, but then things began to turn.  St Pats Knock out Our Ladys to reach Mageean semi final  The Maghera school will now meet St Killians, Garron Tower in the semi final.   Thomas McKeagney punched the air after hitting St Pats first second half score on  minutes, and Callum OKane wriggled free to point and leave them trailing - to - at the water break. Corner back Conor Shiels raised a roar from his team with a long-range free on  minutes to close the gap to three, before St Pats got the little bit of luck they were craving. James Friel sent in a long free, and despite several swinging hurls, the ball floated over them all and into the net. Another Shiels free levelled matters in the th minute, but the expected St Killians backlash never came, and McKeagney nudged Maghera in front on  minutes. A sublime sideline cut from Eoin Scullion doubled the lead three minutes later, before Conor Shiels third free opened a - to - gap. Only a goal would do for Garron Tower, but they watched in disappointment as Joseph McLaughlins attempt at dropping the ball into the box floated over the bar, and Conor Shiels restored the three-point margin with a nd minute free, his fourth of the day. A satisfying comeback for the Maghera side, who will now contest a Mageean Cup final with either St Louis Ballymena or St Patricks Downpatrick, who meet at the Dub on Friday night.

Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too.

They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13261543.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The prime minister, the EU and pan nationalism know this and so treat Jeffrey Donaldson’s threats as no more than empty, hollow rhetoric. They are as void of meaning as Arlene Foster’s “blood red lines” and Nigel Dodds’ “precious Union”. The stark reality for unionism is that the DUP are as much an obstacle to the removal of the protocol as are the EU and pan nationalism.If as unionists we really want to remove the protocol I suggest we must first begin by voting the DUP out of office.

Photo: Liam McBurney PA Wire“Sinn Fein in  denied unionist MLAs the opportunity to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary by laying a simple stone or planting a rose bush in Stormont. Sinn Fein snub the Royal Family [and are] unable to even mark the Duke of Edinburgh’s passing in the same way as other countries.“Such cultural and identity weaponisation will make solutions very dficult to come by as some want cultural domination rather than respect.”Sinn Fein chairman Declan Kearney said that publishing the report without an implementation plan was a “mistake” and called for “an orderly implementation” of its deliverable proposals, PA reported.The report said that many “challenges remain” surrounding flags, bonfires and memorials. There has already been criticism that the -page report, which has cost approximately £,, is not accompanied by a plan for implementing its recommendations.The commission was set up in  to find consensus on a number of contentious issues, but devolution collapsed before it could deliver a report. Its findings were submitted to the first and deputy first ministers last July, and were finally published yesterday. It made  recommendations but it is unlikely they will be enacted. There are  commissioners, including seven from political parties and eight independent members, overseen by Professor Dominic Bryan.On the issue of flying flags on lampposts or other street furniture, the report states: “The commission could not agree on whether changes should be made to current legislation in order to create a similar exemption to that which exists for election posters. “Consequently, without any legislative changes, the commission is not in a position to recommend a code of practice that would accompany any such legislative change.”The report also said there had been “no meeting point” reached on the flying of flags at public buildings. Nor could commissioners agree to take an audit of the number of memorials – mainly paramilitary related – on public land or buildings. The report said that flags supporting paramilitary organisations should not be flown.The commission also discussed the possibility of developing a new civic flag to be “representative of the ersity of our society”.On bonfires, it recommended that the Executive recognises “that they are an important aspect of the culture, identity and tradition of communities and are therefore a legitimate form of celebration or commemoration, provided they are compliant with the law”.The report finally recommended that an Executive action plan was produced on how to implement its recommendations, and to explore unresolved issues.First Minister Paul Givan said the the report had considered a range of complex issues. He added: “It is right that the public have a chance to see the report and have their say, and today’s publication will allow them to do that.”Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The FICT report examines a number of sensitive issues across our community. Addressing these issues is an important part of moving our shared society forward and I put on record my thanks to the commission for their efforts in undertaking this challenging work.”TUV leader Jim Allister said little had been agreed, and so it was “a colossal waste of money”. He said it was clear that some within the media are intent on using ideas that were “discussed but not agreed – such as the preposterous suggestion that the Irish tricolour would be given parity on buildings – as the basis to frame public debate”.Speaking in a personal capacity, PUP deputy leader John Kyle said that any report without an action plan will simply gather dust. “This report, which contains some credible and valuable recommendations, will be a waste of time and public moneythere is no implementation plan,” he added.Sinn Fein’s Mr Kearney said: “I would much rather see scaffolding established in order to ensure an orderly implementation of those proposals within the report that I believe are deliverable.“There are then clearly challenges which remain, butwe had had a framework of next steps then we could tackle those.“It is for the parties who oppose the good sense of an implementation plan to speak and answer for themselves.”SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said the first and deputy first ministers sat on the report for  months before MLAs compelled them to publish it. These issues go to the heart of isions, she said, which was far too important to allow the document to become “an £, ornament” at Stormont.Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson said loyalists should be very attentive to the outworking of any regulation flowing from the report. He said: “It is not about enhancing culture, it is about strangling it – slowly but decisively – via carefully constructed regulatory architecture which is superficially attractive, and often buttressed with financial incentives, but which is ultimately culturally corrosive.”#MORE NEWS:Flags report: ‘Belfast-centred focus on flags that ignores rural victims concerns’A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We got agreement through all the political parties on these issues.”On the failure of Stormont’s Executive Office to publish the report until now, Dr Bryan said: “I can’t speak for why the Executive Office haven’t been able to get it through but there are quite a lot of complexities going on here around the cultural area — including two new language commissions being set up, the setting up of an office of identity and cultural expression which was in the new deal new approach, and all of this stuff has been going forward.“And all of this is in the mix so, in fairness to them [the Executive Office], there are quite a lot of complexities into how you move this forward.”Dr Bryan also said the report had sought to find ways to enable, rather than restrict, “cultural practice”.“If you look at bonfires, for example, they are surrounded by a whole lot of legislation which is really nothing to do with the celebrations and commemorations which bonfires are part of,” he said. “And they sort of get in the way.“So this report is starting to look at the legislative areas and we are suggesting ways that will enable cultural practice.“We haven’t set out in this to stop anybody doing anything. Actually, contrary to that, we look at ways people can be enabled to do things within the law.”He said there was “less progress” on the topic of flags in public areas.Dr Bryan added: “With the flags on public buildings, that is the one area of all of our chapters where I think we got less progress and I think we are all disappointed at that.”Justice Minister Naomi Long has accused Stormont’s Executive Office of a “complete failure of leadership” for failing to “drive forward” progress on the report.The Alliance Party leader, speaking to BBC Radio Ulster, criticised the absence of a plan to put the report’s proposals into practice.She said the long awaited report had now been “abandoned”.She also slammed the long delay in publishing the report, which was given to the Executive “nearly two years ago”.“I think it’s absolutely scandalous that £, was spent on a report that we have had to wait almost two years to see,” she said. “We were told it would be published with an implementation plan.”She continued: “I’ve been writing to the Executive Office and my party’s had a debate in the Assembly on this in March, asking that it be published with an implementation plan so that we could start to take up some of those themes, and where there wasn’t agreement try to find agreement and where there was agreement try to implement it.“Instead, it’s now just being orphaned with nobody taking responsibility for it, which I think is absolutely scandalous.”The minister added: “These are issues that affect people’s everyday lives - bonfires, flags, paramilitary trappings on buildings, all of those things that people are constantly concerned about and raise with us regularly. Instead of taking political leadership and trying to drive a programme of work to address them, this is now simply being abandoned.“Unfortunately, I did say at the time of the Haas talks that that might well be the outcome which was one of the reasons we were very lukewarm on the outcome of those talks.”On whether the report’s findings would be put into practice by the devolved administration, she said: “It certainly doesn’t seem to be going to be implemented by the Executive Office.“We will seek to try to drive forward some progress where we can on that report as a party.“But obviously it should be being done on a cross-departmental basis, and it should be driven forward by the Executive Office. It’s a complete failure of leadership on their part.”South Belfast DUP MLA and lead member on the Executive Office Committee Christopher Stalford welcomed the publication of the report.Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition Report.“The public should now give its views,” he said.“The answer on these matters is mutual respect but it is hard to come by when Sinn Fein campaigns to remove every trace of Britishness from Northern Ireland. “Sinn Fein in  denied unionist MLAs the opportunity to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary by laying a simple stone or planting a rose bush in Stormont. Sinn Fein snub the Royal Family. Unable to even mark the Duke of Edinburgh’s passing in the same way as other counties.“Such cultural and identity weaponization will make solutions very dficult to come by as some want cultural domination rather than respect.“We are complex society drawn mainly from the British Isles. A mix of Irish, English, Welsh and Scots. Some of us are British, some are Irish, some are Northern Irish and there are new and emerging identities.“I will always defend the dignied display of the flag of my country but I will never make excuses for the display of anything that could be associated with a paramilitary organisation. I will always promote the celebration of culture but I will never support anything which glories terrorism or promotes violence. I trust every Party will arrive at a similar position.”Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson said loyalists should be very attentive to the ultimate outworking of any regulation. “It is not about enhancing culture, it is about strangling it- slowly but decisively- via carefully constructed regulatory architecture which is superficially attractive, and often buttressed with financial incentives, but which is ultimately culturally corrosive,” he said.“The purpose of all of these things is to neutralise, and by extension diminish, PUL culture and traditions. The ‘process’ requires the incremental dismantling of the Union, and a key part of that is stage by stage watering down expressions of British and Unionist culture and sovereignty. “This is never more evident than in the FICT proposal for a civic flag. This requires unionism accepting that the sovereign flag of the United Kingdom should not fly, and instead should be replaced by a neutral flag. That of course therefore means further dilution of visible manestations of our sovereignty. “If the  Agreement was a settlement rather than a process, then that settlement should respect the primacy of sovereignty and expressions of same. “The way forward on flags and bonfires in voluntary regulation schemes whereby loyalist communities would self regulate. Any engagement with statutory schemes, in the context of the cultural war whereby statutory bodies are often nationalist soldiers in that battle, would be foolish and self defeating. “You can not regulate culture. I should say however that the proposals for education in terms of Human Rights and the Law is a valuable proposal. PUL communities have been frozen out of the legal arena, and there is a signicant disconnect. In contrast, nationalist communities have very successfully weaponised the law to advance their political objectives. Unionists and loyalists must build the capacity to engage in this kind of lawfare, rather than being confined to the sidelines.”Read the full report here.MORE NEWS:When is Spoty wrapped  How to find your data and who is expected to be the most streamed artist of  A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
