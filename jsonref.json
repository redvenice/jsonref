Even after they split up eleven years later, they have shared the property for six months each of the year.           Michael Douglas\u0027 home has also been left in a state of disrepair with the star having tried to sell it for five years, most recently dropping the price to €26 million (He is pictured with wife Catherine Zeta-Jones in Majorca in 2010)         Building materials such as bricks are seen on the Douglas\u0027 estate as well as a black bin lid sitting int the middle of the space         A fence around the home looks faded and slightly unstable as it bends back towards the Douglas holiday homeThe estate has been left looking rather unkempt since it was placed on the market, with yellow grass covering much of the land and rubbish piled up in some spots. The shutters on the windows are also firmly closed and neighbours on the white isle say they haven’t seen the residents for months and only on the odd occasion in the last decade.Broken tiles and bricks have also been left on the grounds and old wood fires haven’t been cleared away, but despite this the home\u0027s exterior paint still appears to be in good condition.In the past, the stunning Spanish retreat has played host to the likes of Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Michelle Pfeiffer and Jack Nicholson.The property boasts two cottages, five apartments, 10 bedrooms in total, 11 bathrooms, home theater, outdoor heated pool, library, games room, outdoor kitchen, wine cellar and vineyard.

Why? Because at the time of the fire, the vault of the cathedral completely crashed. \u0027There were stones everywhere, but she was spared. She could have naturally received the vault on her head and have been completely crushed,\u0027 Chauvet said.       Notre Dame cathedral rector Patrick Chauvet in Saint-Germain l\u0027Auxerrois church, in Paris - the cathedral\u0027s temporary new home       Notre Dame rector Patrick Chauvet said: \u0027This is the first time since the French Revolution that there will be no midnight Mass.\u0027He recalled the moment on the night of the fire when he discovered it was saved, as he was holding hands with French President Emmanuel Macron on the cathedral´s forecourt. Around midnight as the flames subsided, they were finally let inside to look. Chauvet pointed and exclaimed to Macron: \u0027Look at the Virgin, she is there!\u0027He said later that Notre Dame´s workmen on the ground implored him to not remove the statue from the cathedral, crying that during the restoration \u0027we need it. She protects us.\u0027Chauvet said having it nearby for Christmas is comforting.\u0027She lived very much in Notre Dame. She watched the pilgrims, all the 35,000 visitors a day ... It keeps us going,\u0027 Chauvet said.        Notre Dame Cathedral lit up at night. The last time it was closed for Christmas was in 1789 when the anti-Catholic French revolutionaries turned the monument into \u0027a temple of reason.\u0027Another reason for hope: Since November, after months in the dark, the facade of the cathedral is being lit up after dusk for the first time since the fire. Tourists over the festive period can now see the famed gargoyles and stone statues at night in their full illuminated splendor from the adjacent bridges, although the forecourt is still closed.Cathedral officials carefully chose Saint-Germain l´Auxerrois as the new temporary home because of its proximity to Notre Dame, just next to the Louvre, allowing ease of movement for clerics who lived near the cathedral. Also, because of its prestigious history.It was once a royal church that boasted among its faithful French kings, in the days when they lived in the nearby Louvre Palace. The kings, Chauvet explained, would simply cross the esplanade to come and attend Mass.Since September, the church has been welcoming the cathedral´s flock each Sunday.Though Notre Dame has moved liturgically to a new home, Notre Dame will always remain Paris\u0027 cathedral - officials are at pains to point out - so long as the bishop\u0027s physical chair, or \u0027cathedra\u0027 doesn\u0027t move.Derived from the Greek word for \u0027seat,\u0027 and giving the building its very name, a cathedral\u0027s entire identity technically boils down to the presence of a chair.\u0027The cathedra is at the cathedral and so it remains Notre Dame Cathedral, which is the cathedral in the heart of Paris,\u0027 Chauvet said.It is not only the faithful who have been displaced since April\u0027s devastating blaze.Notre Dame was home to a vibrant 160-strong choir-school, which provided singers for each and every one of the cathedral´s some 1,000 annual services. Midnight Mass at Christmas was always a special event in the year: One of the rare times the entire choir sung together and used the cathedral\u0027s famed acoustics to their fullest.Instead of disbanding, this now-homeless chorus of singers, ranging in age from 6 to 30, has too honed an upbeat message and decided to continue on in a ided form.                            Different sections of the choir put on concerts in churches, such as Saint Eustache and Saint Sulpice, in Paris and beyond. On Christmas Eve, its members will sing at various yuletide events, including at Saint-Germain l\u0027Auxerrois, as well as, bizarrely, at the Russian Circus.But don´t mention the term choir-in-exile to one of the choir´s directors, Henri Chalet.\u0027I´d rather use `beyond the walls´... `Exile´ brings it back to sadness. Obviously, there is a lot of sadness and desolation for us to no longer be in our second home. But there is also a lot of hope because it is only a phase,\u0027 Chalet said.In the grand scheme of things, five or six years of restoration for an 855-year-old cathedral \u0027is nothing at all,\u0027 Chalet reasoned. Macron declared in the days after the blaze it would take a mere five years to restore the cathedral - a timeline many experts deem unrealistic.Notre Dame choir singer Mathilde Ortscheidt, 29, left a little more space for melancholy as she regretted her absence at last year´s Midnight Mass.\u0027To think that I was ill last Christmas...thinking that I would go again this year with no problem!\u0027 she said.On the first rehearsal she attended after the blaze, she said she \u0027felt such a pain and such sadness\u0027 because the cathedral was where she began as a singer.For the singers, the unique acoustics produced by the cathedral´s massive dimensions are sorely missed as the choir continues its mission in other venues.\u0027When we balanced it right, it was the most beautiful feeling of just hearing it resonate through this enormous space,\u0027 Ortscheidt said.Despite having \u0027to walk around a lot now\u0027 people have got used to the choir´s new lifestyle, she said, and it was just a matter of time before there will be song in the cathedral once again.In the meantime, \u0027the important thing for us is that we keep on singing and doing the music. That\u0027s what brings us together.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Dog recovers emergency surgery eating three feet tinsel","story":"Share this article \u0027In veterinary medicine, we call this a linear foreign body.

The Elusive drew admiring glances, her new owner wrote in his log, but he was embarrassed to show fellow mariners the state of the vessel inside\u0027On the first day of her maiden voyage, the mast collar began to leak and on 15 January the forward cabin was flooded with water because of an unfinished cable penetration in the watertight bulkhead,\u0027 explained Mr Justice Teare.Over the next few months, a range of further problems emerged, lawyers said, including a sail block \u0027disintegrating\u0027 and the davit arm - a crane-like structure used for lowering the yacht\u0027s lifeboat - coming loose, leaving the dingy dragging in the water behind the yacht.On January 18, Elusive berthed in La Coruna, Spain, for repairs, but the mast continued to leak and the professional skipper who was helping Mr France find his feet reported: \u0027Crew morale is extremely low.\u0027On January 29, she set sail for the Caribbean on the Atlantic leg of her world cruise, but was forced to retreat to the Canary Islands when her generator packed in.The skipper reported: \u0027We are suffering problems never experienced before and the general feeling is that the boat is not fit.\u0027Other problems included the navigation equipment playing up and the autopilot temporarily \u0027shutting down\u0027.Mr France reported that Elusive was attracting \u0027admiring glances\u0027 from fellow sailors due to her appearance, but complained: \u0027I am embarrassed to show them the state of the boat, with blue tape holding drawers and cupboards shut, towels to catch water leaks, badly stained furniture and stink of diesel in the saloon.\u0027But by May 2017, Elusive had reached Antigua, where he claimed Discovery Yachts Group personnel effected superficial repairs after he sent out a list highlighting the defects.The same month, he sent a \u0027message of complaint\u0027 to Discovery Yachts Group, which read: \u0027Surely this is not the standard of build quality one should expect when spending £1.5m.         The couple jokingly renamed their new 58-foot-long sailing boat the \u0027HMS Disappointment\u0027 \u0027At this time the boat is not fit to sail, and certainly not fit for an ocean passage. I have no confidence in the boat.\u0027By August 2017, Maria was adding to the litany of complaints, emailing about things \u0027which drove her crazy on this beautiful-to-be boat\u0027, while Mr France referred to it as \u0027HMS Disappointment\u0027 in a later message.Elusive\u0027s next port of call was Annapolis, where Discovery Yachts Group carried out further repairs on the boat in September 2017, but Mr France and his wife were \u0027underwhelmed by the work\u0027.He said he even agreed to let Discovery Yachts Group exhibit Elusive at the October 2017 Annapolis Boat Show if they overhauled her with full repairs.And Mr Justice Teare today backed Mr France\u0027s claim, ruling: \u0027It is plain that an agreement had been reached whereby in return for the yacht being exhibited at the Boat Show the outstanding items of repair would be carried out.\u0027Mr France\u0027s legal team said Elusive remains vulnerable in the high seas and is \u0027not watertight\u0027, although capable of tackling calm waters.Maritime experts highlighted defects such as leaking deck hatches, a lack of accuracy in fuel and water gauges, and problems with the battery supply.Failure of catches on cupboards and drawers and a fault in the navigational instruments also rendered Elusive unsuitable for blue-water cruising, Mr Casey said.Part of the underlying problem is that \u0027there are a number of areas where the end grain of woodwork has not been sealed\u0027, he added.\u0027Central to his case is an assertion that the yacht is not watertight,\u0027 he explained.\u0027It became clear that the yacht had not been properly outfitted.\u0027She was not - and is not now - suitable for her agreed purpose: blue-water cruising.\u0027He added: \u0027These were serious and frightening problems, and symptomatic of a vessel that had not been properly outfitted and was not ready to go to sea.\u0027The yacht, which should have become the couple\u0027s permanent base, is now beached on a stand near Lymington awaiting an overhaul, while Mr France and his wife are in rented accommodation.Neither company was represented in court, but in their defence partly blamed Mr France for the yacht\u0027s troubles, while Discovery Yachts Group also maintained it had no contractual relationship with Mr France or his company.It was under no obligation to put right any defects in the yacht, but had made \u0027extra efforts\u0027 to assist him by doing repairs, the company claimed.But Mr France insisted he was no novice, having clocked up many years of maritime experience.After ruling against both companies, Mr Justice Teare made clear Mr France was blameless.\u0027There was a suggestion that the defects are in part attributable to negligence or incompetence by Mr France,\u0027 he told the court.\u0027But the documentary records show that there can be no support for that.\u0027Assessing the sum to be paid by DYS, the judge said he had considered whether he should reduce the amount to reflect \u0027the use or benefit\u0027 Mr France gained from the yacht.But he said any benefit he received from his use of the boat was outweighed by \u0027the disappointment, frustration and anger which Mr France must have experienced\u0027.Although he had been able to sail across the Atlantic, his experience was \u0027so very different from what he had hoped\u0027 when he agreed to buy the yacht.\u0027He did not have the enjoyment and pleasure which he had justifiably expected,\u0027 he said. \u0027A very large number of days were spent waiting in marinas for repairs to be done.\u0027The judge awarded Mr France about £900,000 from DYS, based on the reduced value of the boat.

Egypt was the first in 1998.

The residency issue was a convenient method of terminating his membership.\u0027         Retired Australian lawyer John Cawood won his case against Sunningdale Golf Club in Hampshire, pictured, over allegations it terminated overseas membership because he was playing too often. Mr Cawood paid £975 for overseas membership compared with £3,245 for full membership The court heard that Mr Cawood was an overseas member of the club from 1997 to 2015, paying £975-a-year, considerably less than the £3,245-a-year full membership fee.Overseas members had all of the same rights as full members, although their use of the golf course was limited to only 30 days\u0027 play per year, said the judge.The club said his membership was terminated after years of concern about the amount of time he was spending at Sunningdale, as shown by his use of a payment card.In the 11 months before his membership was ended, he had been physically present on 94 days, strongly suggesting to the committee that he was resident in the UK.The club said the termination of his overseas membership did not mean he was prevented from being a member, as he could apply for full membership, but didn\u0027t.Taking the case to court, Mr Cawood applied for an injunction and damages payment, claiming that the club committee was wrong in saying he was not resident abroad.         The court heard that former club captain John Jermine had \u0027an underlying dislike of Mr Cawood and the intent to be rid of him\u0027 Despite having lived in accommodation close to Sunningdale, he insisted that he is an Australian with no intention of changing his permanent home to any other country.\u0027Australia is my real home for all the obvious reasons,\u0027 he told the judge. \u0027Much as I like the US and love the UK, my emotional and historic ties are to Australia.\u0027Mr Cawood\u0027s lawyers claimed he was disliked by some members, which fed into the committee\u0027s \u0027biased\u0027 decision to terminate his membership.Ruling on the case today, Judge Saunders said there were \u0027numerous examples of the committee\u0027s ill feeling\u0027 towards Mr Cawood.Former club captain John Jermine had claimed in an email that Mr Cawood was \u0027continuing to use the club as his country club with no apparent remorse\u0027.The evidence heard in the trial showed Mr Jermine\u0027s \u0027underlying dislike of Mr Cawood and the intent to be rid of him,\u0027 the judge added.\u0027Such evidence does not just flow from Mr Jermine,\u0027 he continued.\u0027In a draft letter to several club members, Mr Leslie McNeile, then the captain, made a thinly veiled threat of disciplinary proceedings against those members should they invite Mr Cawood to attend the club as a visitor.\u0027It is not clear whether the letter was sent but the fact that it was mentioned in a draft is indicative of the attitude of those on the committee that they would consider threatening disciplinary proceedings against members just for inviting Mr Cawood as a guest.\u0027\u0027The club allowed themselves to concentrate wrongly on the days that he spent in the club by reference to his swipe cards.\u0027Whilst I accept that this may be some evidence upon which to reach the decision that they did, it was insufficient to determine permanent residence in the UK. This is again irrational.\u0027I am also concerned that, at least within some of the members of the committee, there was a strong feeling of dislike motivated by their view that the claimant was taking advantage of his overseas membership...\u0027The judge said Mr Cawood and his partner live a \u0027peripatetic\u0027 lifestyle, iding their time between three different countries.\u0027I find that the time they spend in one country will often depend on their personal circumstances at any particular time,\u0027 he said.\u0027I am therefore satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, and upon the evidence, that he is not permanently resident in the UK.\u0027On balance, I do not believe that he has any intention of setting up home here.\u0027The fact that he used the club whilst he was in the UK is just a natural consequence of his lifestyle at that time.\u0027The judge made an injunction, reinstating Mr Cawood\u0027s membership, and awarded him £250 damages for the \u0027embarrassment\u0027 caused.\u0027This is an emotive type of case,\u0027 he said.\u0027Membership of any sports club - particularly where one is a longstanding member and where sport is a love of one\u0027s life - is extremely important.\u0027To certain people, where golf is concerned, such a membership is more than simply playing golf - to many it is a lifestyle choice and with a significant social element.\u0027Mr Cawood is a longstanding member, enjoys playing golf and having use of the facilities.\u0027Sunningdale Golf Club is a top prestigious club and if he were, for example, to seek membership at another club then it would be very difficult for him to find an equivalent alternative - if at all.\u0027He has many of his closest friends there.\u0027He added: \u0027I accept that there will inevitably be some difficulty due to the clash of personalities evident in the oral evidence I heard but, in such a large club, I am satisfied that the risk of that would be small, that the parties as a whole are sensible, and that any tension or conflict could easily be managed and avoided.\u0027Mr Cawood brought his case against several inidual members as representatives of the whole membership, but the judge said effectively the case was against the club itself. "},{"url":null,"title":"Incredible moment K9 officer Duke leaps broken truck window apprehend fugitive driver","story":"Share this article The pursuit began in Fontana and ended in Corona, when cops said they used a pit maneuver to stop Vasquez\u0027s truck, which they pelted with rubber bullets, police said.The barrage cracked the drivers window enough so Duke could leap through to apprehend the driver using \u0027non-lethal\u0027 force, police said.Despite being punched by the suspect, Duke got his man without injury. \u0027He\u0027s doing fine.

So why have you probably not read it? The illusions of the American magician with the same name have probably been scrutinised more thoroughly than the mysterious magic hidden here, and yet the reading public still regards David Copperfield as not just a literary treasure but a familiar friend. Phrases from the book – “Barkis is willin’”, “Procrastination is the thief of time: collar him”, “Ever so ’umble”, “Something will turn up” – feel like remembered lines from an old hymnal. We may not have read David Copperfield, but we think we know what it’s like to have done so.Could it be that, though we’ve all heard of the great Mr Micawber and Uriah Heep, our understanding of them is formed more by the accumulated memories of performances in TV and cinema? As someone who has just released a film adaptation of this book, I’m aware I may be adding to this problematic legacy. My only defence would be that I felt compelled to make the movie after recently rereading the book and being astonished by the unexpected modernity of the narrative and the sheer boisterous energy of the language there was so much more in this novel than I’d ever seen on screen.David gets drunk, and all of London swirls around him. Seeing himself in the mirror he declares that his hair looks drunk, before he tumbles down the stairs. He falls in love with Dora and sees her name on items of cutlery as he’s eating. David Copperfield is a work filled with surreal visions, thrilling metaphors and deft one-liners. Most adaptations tend to concentrate on the story and not on poetic imagery, but in this book, language is all. The plot, being the depiction of a life, is, like most lives, a mess but the pattern, the controlling force of the narrative, rests in the depiction of an inner imagination taking shape, processing what he sees and hears, and trying to construct an inner meaning out of the otherwise random experiences that he lives through.To read the book, then, is to be taken by surprise. Micawber, for example, is often thought of as a jovial roly-poly character, played in film versions by such actors as WC Fields or Ralph Richardson, rotund and full of bonhomie despite a life continually on the run from creditors owed a slag-heap of debts. Dickens writes something far more stark, though: a desperate, hungry man going through erratic mood swings linked to his financial state, smiling one minute, talking and acting out very graphic suicidal thoughts the next. He’s good company, but also a leech on others, infecting with debt all those who befriend him.Or what of Mr Dick, a man constantly distracted with the unstoppable thoughts that seem to have come from a beheaded Charles the First? So often portrayed as a figure of fun, a simpleton and eccentric to be laughed at, Mr Dick is actually a humane depiction of a good-hearted man in mental pain. It’s the first proper description in English fiction of mental illness. Even Uriah Heep surprises. We’ve known him as the personification of a banal evil, a pathetic and suffocating parasite, determined to exploit the vulnerabilities of others to maximise his status. What’s actually in the book is something more ambiguous and original: yes, he’s villainous, but also strangely fragile, and the reader can’t help but feel there’s a strain of cruelty in how David and his circle laugh at his behaviour and relish his downfall. It’s as if Uriah is the negative image of David himself, a warning to our hero, and to us, of what David might have become. Both he and Uriah live with early misfortune: the difference is that one chooses to free himself of it by relying on friendship and turning to honest work, while the other decides he can liberate himself by smothering the hope in those who regard themselves as his betters. David and Uriah are a fork in the road.Reading this book, while trying to forget the many retellings of it, constantly takes us on these surprising journeys. This is no dusty relic, but instead something sparkling and modern. The theme is a narrator asking himself if he’s to become the hero of his own life, and giving as his answer 800 pages in which he seems not to know who he is, shuttled from memory to memory, sanctuary to sanctuary, and even from name to name: each new relationship David forms is marked by a fresh christening as he gets called Davy, then Trotwood, soon shortened to Trot, then suddenly Daisy followed by Doady. If I were an academic, I’d say we’re in the realms of meta-fiction (I’m not, so I won’t).Something new is happening here. David Copperfield is Dickens’s first novel narrated entirely in the first person. More than that, the book’s opening chapters are partly autobiographical. Dickens’s previous novels were episodic and written in weekly or monthly instalments. The plot was made up as he went along, and all his invention went into dreaming up self-contained comic episodes or heart-stopping cliff-hangers. In David Copperfield Dickens plays down the melodrama and is happy to end chapters on quieter moments of personal reflection or growth.This is Dickens beginning to fashion a storyline that is greater than the sum of its parts. He doesn’t quite achieve it here (as I said, the plot is a mess) but we encounter the themes that he was to develop in greater depth in the novels that were to follow. In David Copperfield we get the sudden changes in fortune and guilty moments of snobbery that are to be fleshed out in Great Expectations. We take our first look at the Marshalsea debtors’ prison, which is to be the core of Little Dorrit. We explore the law, and are also subject to a narrator’s tricks of narrative: both are to be the main components of Bleak House.David Copperfield is the second half of Dickens’s writing career in protean form. In this book, he’s stumbling on something as if for the first time. He had already seen what he could achieve as a writer he was the most famous one in the world, the author of the internationally successful The Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist and the world’s first “celebrity” novelist. In David Copperfield, though, the discovery is more significant: as we read it, we see Dickens grow excited at what he could do not just as a writer, but as a novelist. It was the true making of him as an artist, and it’s no wonder that it became his “favourite child”.• The Personal History of David Copperfield is on general release in the UK on 24 January.

But why were its backers – the House of Saud among them – so keen to pour billions into it in the first place? By  Matthew ZeitlinIt’s so easy to focus on Adam Neumann, the tall, long-haired, barefoot, meat-banning, weed-smoking, tequila-drinking, Kabbalah-studying, experimental school-opening Paltrow-cousin-in-law and founder and now deposed chief executive officer of the We Company, the real estate company that dropped “Work” from its name after it bought the copyright for the word “We” from Neumann himself.Neumann’s ambitions were as ludicrous as his persona. “Rather than just renting desks,” Fast Company reported in January, “the company aims to encompass all aspects of people’s lives, in both physical and digital worlds.” This included expanding the WeWork model to residential housing and education. Before Neumann had even started the company, he had envisioned “WeSleep to WeSail to WeBank”. While none of these will ever be realised, perhaps he was right to think beyond office space subleasing. The company as he had built it is in crisis.Everything went wrong for WeWork soon after it publicly filed documents for an initial public offering of shares, on 14 August. Six weeks later, Neumann had voted to remove himself from the CEO job and given up his majority control of WeWork’s stock. The company’s proposed valuation had fallen by more than half, and the IPO had been called off entirely. The failed IPO and the company’s subsequent takeover by SoftBank, its largest investor, were both facilitated by the public exposure of long-known information: WeWork was losing a ton of money its projections of the size of the market for shared office space (up to $3tn) were wildly optimistic (it counted anyone who worked at a desk in an American city where there was a WeWork as a potential “member” in non-US cities with WeWorks, the estimate applied to anyone with an office job) and its corporate culture and strategy were completely in hock to Neumann and his family’s bizarre ideas and whims.The company’s business model had been known to be expensive and have little path to profitability since at least 2015, when BuzzFeed first published documents WeWork had used to solicit investors. Neumann’s weird behaviour, meanwhile, had been part of the sales pitch from the very beginning. What seemed to make this year’s WeWork stories different, and more damaging, was the addition of alleged self-dealing and self-enrichment by Neumann to the core model of leasing office buildings, transforming them into “shared” workspaces, providing free beer to tenants, and then counting on a rotating cast of freelancers, venture-funded startups and some larger corporations to pay rents that could be as short as a month at a time. But Neumann’s propensity to sell stock and lease buildings he partially owned back to WeWork wasn’t news either – it was exposed by the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, before the trouble started.The more sceptical sections of the financial press have always had WeWork’s number, even when the company’s footprint and valuation were soaring. In 2017, the Wall Street Journal’s indefatigable Neumann correspondent Eliot Brown described “A $20 Billion Startup Fueled by Silicon Valley Pixie Dust”. It was all there: his casual transubstantiation of office space subleasing into something more like software (he had told investors they were buying into a “physical social network”), as well as the doubts from anyone who knew about his actual business – real estate – that the company was worth $20bn, let alone the $47bn it was valued at in its last round of private fundraising, let alone the more than $100bn Morgan Stanley reportedly told the company it could be worth.What happened since August wasn’t the consequence of the kind of investigative journalism that felled Theranos, or the long-foreshadowed public tumble of an Uber. It was more akin to the kind of frenzied group condemnations that emanate from Twitter every so often. Widely known facts were re-aired in a new climate. What was once amusing or somewhat confusing was now, in a new light, merely horrifying. But this time, instead of hopped-up teenagers hurling moralistic condemnation at mediocre TV shows, it was middle-aged men condemning a 220-page financial statement on Twitter, in real time.Past exposés of WeWork’s kooky business practices and sunny projections had relied on documents distributed to potential venture investors. When WeWork turned to the bond market last year to borrow hundreds of millions, it had to deliver some more revelations. What the investor documents showed, amid all the fantastical profit projections, was that in 2017 WeWork had lost $883m, despite having some $886m in revenue. A leak to the Financial Times revealed that in 2018 the company managed to lose $1.9bn on some $1.8bn of revenue.Throughout all this, Neumann was being Neumann. His private jet trips may have involved some incidental transportation of marijuana across international borders, his wife may have fired employees for their bad vibes, and the company may have ended a meeting announcing layoffs with a performance by a member of Run-DMC.But Neumann’s leadership and loose corporate culture wasn’t all surfing in the Males, guitar-shaped houses and expensive experimental schools, according to one lawsuit. A former WeWork employee alleged last year in a civil case that she was groped or forcibly kissed at corporate events, including at an alcohol-fuelled WeWork “Summer Camp”, and that her complaints resulted in little attention from human resources and little to no action against her alleged assailants. She was later fired.“The sexual harassment and assaults of Plaintiff did not happen in a vacuum,” the employee’s complaint read. “They are product in part of the entitled, frat-boy culture that permeates WeWork from the top down.” The former employee specifically mentioned that during her job interview with Neumann, he served shots of tequila and that “company managers and executives heap immense pressure on employees to attend after-work events and place a premium on employees’ participation in the parties that WeWork sponsors”. The company said she had been fired for poor performance.What transformed WeWork from an investor darling into a pariah didn’t belong to any predetermined boom-and-bust model, and it wasn’t about prosaic investor concerns, like future cash flows. According to the great Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine, WeWork’s downfall could only be explained in abstract terms. Something about what happened – and the speed with which it occurred – seemed unknowable.Levine pointed out that at its peak valuation, WeWork was worth almost half the entire value of publicly traded US real estate investment trusts: “Nobody gets into venture capital because the best-case scenario is doubling their money.” Such returns would be far too small. “For WeWork, maximal office-landlording success would be kind of disappointing,” wrote Levine. More ambitious schemes were required. If you could somehow build a company that included micro-apartments, software and schools, then, sure, why not? Maybe it really would be worth $100bn someday. Or, at least, if people as smart as WeWork’s venture capital investors bought into this, then surely the less sophisticated asset managers that buy into IPOs would, too.That’s not how things worked out. Private investors are supposed to be long-term thinkers – especially SoftBank, which claims it wants “to create an ecosystem that will continue to grow for 300 years”. But WeWork’s investors folded quickly, suddenly demanding from the company the focus and discipline critics had been saying was missing for years. Maybe some of the more dour and anonymous asset managers expected the CEO of a nearly $50bn company to act like one, while his venture capital investors wanted him to maintain his overwhelming ambition.But it was precisely those investors, SoftBank and the Silicon Valley venture firm Benchmark, that forced him out. What was strange was that they knew better than anyone that WeWork really did need to raise more money to address its endemic cash burning. Even Levine admitted to being a little stumped: “WeWork’s investors, particularly SoftBank, were there because of Neumann’s upside, his ability to sell a wild vision of WeWork as a transformative company that can dominate the world and justify a $47bn private valuation. And now, nah, never mind, office landlord.”Unlike real estate booms past, WeWork’s subleasing spree won’t leave behind many monuments: no half-built skyscraper complexes in Kuala Lumpur, no pointless airports in rural Spain. Instead the money found its way into already existing infrastructure, made visible only by discreet signs or logos on windows scattered on office buildings in New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Boston.WeWork had consistently promoted itself as “asset light”: its buildings leased from developers, then, after being subided, rented out on a short-term basis. This lightness will stand out as WeWork’s true innovation, in two ways. The first was that by signing leases, as opposed to buying or even building, it could grow incredibly quickly, as long as it was able to raise enough money to cough up rent. It also built light. Contra its loudest critics, WeWork is more than just marketing, spin and pineapple water. It has used all of that atmospherical ephemera to convince workers – whether they’re freelancers or employees of fast-growing companies that can’t build out their own space quickly enough – that they don’t need as much space as they might have thought. One estimate puts WeWork’s square footage per “member” at around 50 sq ft, well short of the office average of 250. WeWork is thus able to charge high rents for substantially less space than its competitors.But because of its pretensions to being a technology company, the offering to tenants is famously flexible: you can rent month to month and can easily expand or shrink your space according to your needs. For WeWork, this means that the revenue can vary substantially over a year. If there were ever a large drop in demand for flexible office space, WeWork would still have its own lease payments to contend with. In its company filings, WeWork placed its average lease length at 15 years and wrote that it was on the hook for some $47bn worth of payments, with only $4bn of revenue commitments from members. The company is essentially renting long and subleasing short, leaving itself exposed to the same risk as financial institutions that fund themselves with short-term borrowing while maintaining long-term funding commitments.A model this risky requires an unusual source of investment, and these days SoftBank is the most unusual of all. Or perhaps the second most unusual, after its own partner: the Saudi government. A year before SoftBank’s Saudi-backed Vision Fund poured $4.4bn into WeWork, in 2017, the Saudis invested directly in Uber. WeWork and Uber’s involvement with the Saudi government raised hackles in the press. For a while, before the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, the two companies were able to pitch themselves as liberalising forces in Saudi Arabia, helped along by the government’s eventual announcement that women would finally be able to drive. But when the Saudis attempted to host a “Davos in the desert” investment conference soon after Khashoggi’s murder, several technology and finance executives dropped out. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s brutal purge of the Saudi elite investor class had not provoked much of an outcry from the American public and business class neither had the brutal war against Yemen. The dismemberment of a journalist, overseen by some of the prince’s closest advisers, was different.Khashoggi’s killing was so shocking and blunt that even SoftBank’s CEO, Masayoshi Son, was compelled to condemn it. But that was as far as Son went. He would stay in business with the Saudis because SoftBank had “accepted the responsibility to the people of Saudi Arabia … to help them manage their financial resources and ersify their economy”.It is in this nexus – between the Japanese telecom company trying to turn itself into an investor betting on a global technology revolution, a cash-rich nation trying to ersify its economy and embed itself into non-energy global markets, and an ambitious entrepreneur trying to raise as much money as possible – that the WeWork mania and Neumann’s behaviour come into focus.When it comes to Neumann, there are two erging theories. In one telling, he let his ambition get ahead of his abilities to run a profitable business: he was simply taking what money was available and pouring it back into the company, trying to deliver the impressive revenue growth that venture capital investors supposedly want. In a different telling, suggested by another one of WeWork’s great chroniclers, the journalist Reeves Wiedeman, Neumann is the genius of this period of venture capital mania. His deal to give up control over the company in SoftBank’s acquisition of majority control over it only proves it further: the Japanese conglomerate is buying $1bn of WeWork stock from Neumann along with an $185m consulting fee and $500m in order to pay off a loan from JPMorgan – and, the Wall Street Journal reported, covering $1.75m he owed the company for using the company’s private jet for “surf vacations and other jaunts”. Neumann may have become a laughing stock, but he is a very rich laughing stock.One of the great mysteries of modern finance is how to make money when you know there’s a bubble, or at least how to get much, much richer than everyone else. The obvious way is to bet against the bubble, but this is difficult, as its expansion can easily outlast one’s ability to finance the wager. It’s even harder if the bubble is primarily happening in the private markets, where it is very difficult, if not impossible, to directly bet against the fortunes of a company that you think is overvalued. What you can do, however, is try to find a way to soak up as much money as possible from optimistic investors and then furiously distribute it to yourself and your family, so that by the time things turn, you’re already rich.And to properly pull this off, you would need to find investors with a lot of money that they felt obligated to spend. It was just as important for WeWork to serve as a parking place for Saudi and Japanese cash as it was to provide office space for burgeoning businesses. In the introduction to SoftBank’s most recent annual report, Son thanks shareholders for their support as “we continue to move forward, inspired by our belief in the power of technology to build a more connected, efficient, and joyful world, as expressed by our corporate philosophy: ‘Information Revolution – Happiness for Everyone.’” He goes on to hail the coming “AI Revolution, which is poised to redefine all industries – including education, health care, real estate and finance, as well as the advertising and retail sectors”. This revolution will, Son intends, be funded by SoftBank.The scale suggested by Son’s plan is massive – literally all industrial output for the rest of human history – and it has been matched by the Vision Fund, which raised almost $100bn, including a $45bn commitment from Saudi Arabia. But you still have to invest the money, or, as Son put it, “take the helm of a group of companies led by top AI entrepreneurs from all different fields, much like a preeminent orchestra made up of virtuosos on scores of instruments, and help them harmonise, while creating additional value along the way”.Unlike traditional venture capital funds that might raise, at most, a few billion from wealthy families and pension funds, SoftBank needed to raise much, much more, because its strategy was different. When those traditional venture capital firms are confronted with a bizarre, failed investment, more often than not they will shrug it off, pointing out that their overall returns are overwhelmingly generated from a few hugely successful bets. This model is most effective with software companies, which require some startup capital to hire engineers and start selling a product, but then can quickly turn into highly profitable businesses as they find a market and mature.But as the technology industry grew, the market for funding tech companies changed. Following the financial crisis, interest rates fell to rock-bottom levels, cash piled up on companies’ balance sheets and in the hands of the ultra-wealthy, and regulatory changes made going public quickly less attractive. Technology companies were able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other huge pools of capital when, 10 years earlier, they would have had to sell their shares to the public. But the resources and eagerness on the part of these funds – and the wealthy families that spent as lavishly – would come to mean what one might call over-investment.While the cost of starting a traditional startup has plummeted thanks to cheaply available server access from Amazon, companies that, in the parlance of the industry, move “atoms” (stuff) instead of “bits” (code) can be ruinously expensive to run. Whether it’s the cost of leasing and building out new locations for WeWork, or the torrent of rider discounts and driver bonuses that Uber and Lyft pay out to start up new markets, these companies eat through investor cash for years in order to survive.Looking backwards through the telescope, the mega-funding for app-based taxi-cab dispatchers and beer-distributing office subleasers makes more sense as a case of savvy operators creating landing zones for massive flows of cash, of demand for big “tech” investments creating a supply of them, which can then be sold as the next big thing. What distinguishes many of these companies, especially ones that have received investment from SoftBank, is their neither-fish-nor-fowl, real worldsoftware nature, along with their insatiable need for capital. As popular business analyst Ben Thompson has argued, the Vision Fund may have confused companies that need lots of capital with companies that offer big opportunities, resulting in a “paucity of tech companies” in its portfolio and instead a collection of Wags and WeWorks.So why did the Saudi government want to pour money into companies selected seemingly almost at random by a charismatic and eccentric Japanese businessman? The resulting fit between the Saudis and Neumann was not just awkward for business reasons, but also cultural. Not because Neumann is Israeli, or likes weed and tequila, but because to a degree unusual even by startup-founder standards, WeWork had wrapped itself in gauzy rhetoric about its ability to change the world. This led to predictable tension when it turned out that the company’s biggest funder was Saudi Arabia, a country ruled by an authoritarian regime and where religious authorities still exercise tremendous control over everyday life.In the old days – which is to say before 2017 – Saudi leaders were content for their relationship with the US to be relatively discreet. Ever the flashy millennial, Bin Salman wanted more attention, touring the US in 2018 and publicly wooing the most visible instantiations of the American imperium: technology executives, prominent journalists, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. As part of his much-ballyhooed “opening” of Saudi Arabia, he even allowed an American movie to be screened on Saudi soil. The film told the story of an ambitious young king seeking to open up his rich but isolated country to the world: Black Panther.The attempted ersification of Saudi Arabia’s economy has occasionally veered off into farce, like when the government tasked western consulting firms with implementing Bin Salman’s dreams of a future city in the Arabian desert called Neom. (According to the Wall Street Journal, Neom would feature a beach that supposed to glow “like the face of a watch”, as well as a “robo-cage fight”, “one of many sports on offer”.)If Neom and Bin Salman’s American grand tour were the most visible attempts in a wider plan to become something more than an oil supplier to the modern corporate technology world, then the cheque written to SoftBank is the downpayment. And if WeWork is what happens when capital is in the hands of resource-rich autocracies, futurist telecom executives and cash-rich mature companies, perhaps it can serve as a launching point for thinking about how capital would behave differently under the aegis of democratic control.The “We” in WeWork was the customers working in the offices, living in the apartment buildings, and learning in the schools – not the people determining where any of this was built, and in what quantity. If money is indeed piling up on the balance sheets of large corporations and in the coffers of the Saudi treasury as proceeds for burning the planet – and if that money is ultimately at the disposal of a farseeing Japanese mobile phone mogul – one might ask if it could be managed differently if it were in the hands of, well, “We”.A longer version of this article first appeared at nplusonemag• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b82d1c1fb126ae4a7840e0d6be72e7bce0d55f1/0_514_7680_4609/master/7680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8582ff3532fa1e4baa45d0b9519e0a5","title":"a classist dystopia inside the worlds largest underground shopping complex","story":"Underground cities: Subterranean ‘cities-under-cities’ are spreading around the world, but for sheer continuous commercial distance, Toronto remains kingI’ve worked in a Path-connected building for over a decade, long enough to remember a time when it had smoking rooms. A couple of years back, I began to notice a guy sitting outside my building, wearing cargo shorts and a T-shirt, huffing a brick-sized vape while gaming on his phone. Summer turned to fall turned to winter, and still the shorts remained, his aloof pose untempered by the sleet or snow. He seemed to me to embody the apotheosis of Pathitude. For him, weather seemed an obsolete curio of a less-evolved time.Take a walk through Toronto’s financial district and you probably won’t realise that you stand atop the largest underground shopping complex in the world. You might see the occasional doorway at street level bearing the words “Retail Concourse” in a nondescript font, but for the most part the more than 100 entrances to this labyrinth, known as the Path, are accessible only from within the office towers.The stats certainly inspire awe, of a sort: 30km of networked passageways 75 connected buildings 1,200 stores, eateries, and services 200,000 daily users 4m sq ft feet of retail C$1.7bn (£1bn) in annual sales. But the Path is a monolith that at no point feels monolithic. When I asked a financial district-employed friend of mine how he felt about it, he could not muster a single feeling.Unlike the ornate subways of Moscow or the macabre catacombs of Paris, the Path does not call out for attention. It is workmanlike. Functional. A convenience rather than a destination, which its transformation into ghost town on evenings and weekends reaffirms. It’s largely beige in colour and in spirit. If the catacombs are Alien Sex Fiend, then the Path is Pearl Jam.It is not a place for wanderers. People down here walk quickly, with a purpose in their step, whether they be power brokers or the support workers who service them. Rolling briefcases whirr along the marble floors. The morning rush hour introduces a crush of unidirectional movement from Union Station to the financial district the workday’s end reverses this. Walter Benjamin and other members of the flâneur class would grimace.Lunchtime is more chaotic, occasionally resembling a less intense Shibuya-style scramble. Many of the eateries, from the much-loved independent Korean joint HoGa to the French macaron vendor Laduree or any of the 13 branches of Starbucks, roll out an array of airport-style, retractable-belted stanchions to tame the swarms. Groups of people perch around laptops, proving that if some merely go directly from the boardroom to the food court, the true alphas bring the boardroom to the food court.Across the world, these tunnel cities are spreading. Montreal’s Réso system is slightly bigger than Toronto’s Path, boasting 33km and 2,000 retail spaces, though in three disconnected sections. Sydney has one Singapore, too and Riyadh is building a pedestrian tunnel network above ground for the new King Abdullah Financial District.Helsinki has probably dug furthest, with more than 200km of tunnels spread across 500 disconnected spaces, though only a small fraction of it is open to the public, with the rest used for wastewater treatment, energy distribution and other infrastructure. Helsinki is also the most playfully designed: undulating cave walls painted white are festooned with the occasional vertical garden, and there is an underground museum, church, swimming pool, and hockey rink – just the sort of thing that gets brought up when people speak idealistically of the Nordic countries.But in terms of sheer continuous commercial distance, Toronto remains king. Though its magnitude suggests top-down urban planning, in reality the Path emerged patchwork-like over the course of a century. The first tunnel was built in 1900 between the T Eaton department store and its discount annex across the street (possibly in an effort to one-up Simpson’s, its rival directly to the south). By 1917, five Eaton buildings were connected. In 1929, a tunnel connected Union Station and the newly-built Royal York Hotel.But it was from 1954, when Scottish engineer Matthew Lawson was put in charge of city planning, that Path began to take shape. Lawson foresaw overcrowded sidewalks, as the newly growing financial district increasingly privileged massive lobbies over street-level retail. He envisioned a connected, subterranean network as a kind of realpolitik solution: below-grade retail was exempted from density restrictions, promoting expansion downward, and the city also agreed to split tunnel construction costs with the building owners.The cost-splitting was revoked in 1976 by a reformist city council, hostile to such megaprojects, but by then the flurry of financial district construction had rendered it moot: Commerce Court West, First Canadian Place (still Canada’s tallest office building) and the multitower Mies van der Rohe-designed Toronto-Dominion Centre each had its own underground shopping concourse, with further connections between buildings proliferating throughout the 1980s.The Path as we know it today was unified in 1995 by a thoroughly ineffective wayfinding system – small grey signs that only directed you to the building immediately adjacent. The ineffectiveness was partially by design. Property managers worried that if certain routes were encouraged over others, non-artery retail would suffer and rents would fall. And so commenced the tension between the Path’s civic and commercial interests, between people trying to get from point A to point B and the property managers who wanted people shopping in their stores. A new wayfinding system has improved matters somewhat, but just as Berlin superclub Berghain forgoes mirrors (or reflective surfaces of any kind), the Path still forgoes the concepts of north, south, east, and west. The signs never explicitly tell you which way you’re going, barring a few hard-to-find compasses on the ceiling. The psychic fencing has proved effective: show me a person who can effortlessly walk the two kilometres from the Toronto Coach Station to the waterfront and I will show you an obsessive.Some have wondered if more explicit nods to the compass would even do any good. Since its layout is dictated by the vertical architecture of the buildings above, only tenuous homage is paid to the street grid. And despite its pastiche of architectural styles, you’re generally overcome by the crushing sameness of it all. The white Italian Carrara marble of First Canadian Place gives way to the Swedish Red Napoleon granite of Scotia Plaza, but there aren’t really landmarks to sink the teeth of memory into, though there are at least 20 Tim Hortons. Still, there are pockets of grandeur. Climbing up into the galleria of Brookfield Place’s six-storey parabolic canopy could certainly be called grand. Similarly, entering the Royal York’s ornate lobby from below, where duelling winding staircases rise along opposite halves of a large circular floor slice, verges on cinematic. Meanwhile, Van der Rohe’s aesthetic exactitude shapes the passageways beneath the Toronto-Dominion Centre in arch-modernist style: shops with the glass panels, black aluminium and backlit white lettering selected by Mies, right down to the austere sans serif font. The rules were relaxed in the 1990s, however, ruffling the feathers of Bauhausian purists and peppering the window displays with all manner of multi-coloured graphical cringe.But for many the Path is a place to work. So what of those workers,some 6,000 of whom toil in the Path’s sunless hallways? “The worst job I ever had was being a barista down there,” said a friend who logged two years at the Path outpost of a local cafe chain. “I would cry in the washroom a lot. It feels like a classist dystopian hellscape.“As a service worker you’re essentially ignored by the business people. But there is a solidarity,” he said. “We traded food and drinks with other businesses. Janitors are assigned one hallway that they mop all day long, so you get to know them really well and build a bond because they’re also mistreated or invisible. In the winter I would go down when it was dark and leave when it was dark and wouldn’t see the sun.”Katie Whittaker, owner of the non-Path bar Thirsty and Miserable, used to work at an LCBO (the government-owned liquor retailer). “We sold lots of 375ml bottles of vodka to businessmen at the Royal Bank Plaza store,” she said. “They would buy handfuls of them at once. Handy for GO Train commuting back to the ‘burbs. Also easy to hide drinking in the office.”In these and other ways, the Path feels less Jane Jacobs – the champion of messy street-level urbanism who adopted Toronto as her home – than Robert Moses, her arch nemesis from New York, albeit minus the wanton bulldozing and mass displacement of minority communities. But its patchwork nature and loose publicprivate partnership does more or less chime with what some have called Jacobs’ crypto-libertarian tendencies: other than the unified signage, the city has taken a hands-off approach, with daily management left up to the buildings. The Path is also reserved exclusively for pedestrian use, where Moses’s large-scale interventions were predominantly in service of the automobile. Still others might say that pushing pedestrians underground demonstrates an abject and total capitulation to cars. This summer, members of the Financial District Business Improvement Area conducted a Jane’s Walk tour to attempt to square the Path with her legacy: whether cynical appropriation or earnest effort is anyone’s guess.Perhaps the Path’s most galaxy-brained move was one in the service of the financial district’s property managers. It transformed what would otherwise be reasonably cheap and undesirable commercial basement real estate into some of the priciest in the country. With most denizens not straying more than a couple of buildings away from their own, the Path mirrors the consolidation of internet traffic by the big tech of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Youtube, in which the idea of an endless frontier is more attractive than actually treading beyond the horizon.And still Path expansion continues unabated: it now reaches south of the financial district, right up to the cusp of the waterfront, with plans to extend it further east along the lake. Construction has begun on another tunnel, connecting the HSBC building directly to Union Station. The city’s endless condo boom promises to eat up ever greater swaths of the downtown core, and it is not hard to envisage our netherworld expanding along with it. In the future we may all be wearing cargo shorts to work as the frost sets in.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfc217bd8c2c3a89dc6191540fa8ed173f8ebfcc/102_182_1053_632/master/1053.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65138c6dba6d0043fdd1f66dffbdde1c","title":"how do you stop a megacity grinding to a halt a cartoon","story":"Until four years ago Dar Es Salaam had no public transport.

Neither whoops of entertainment nor hoots of derision met the first press screening of Tom Hooper’s riotously anticipated Cats. Yet more ominously: there was no munching. The free popcorn went untouched as soon as the film began. This was not politesse. Food was the last thing anyone fancied.The problem with the film version of Cats isn’t that it’s bad. Bad is no barrier to box office success. It can be a boon: cackling gangs might make a date of it, staggering in with supplies so they can neck a shot every time they hear a synth. The casually curious fork out just to check the critics were correct. Appealing to rubberneckers is now the distributor’s key strategy, billing Cats as “the must-see experience of the festive season”.That won’t work. Cats is bad: a calamity from which the careers of all involved may never recover. But, strangely enough, what makes it a mustn’t-ever-see is its sexuality. Yes, Cats turns out to be a nauseous orgy throbbing with the energy of a hundred horny cat-people, thrusting and licking, rubbing and lapping, ferociously randy despite a complete lack of genitals.No one saw that coming. Reaction to the early trailers focused on the weird ears and Judi Dench in a jacket apparently fashioned from the hair of dead relatives. It isn’t until you’ve seen the finished film you realise: this is the kinkiest film you’ll see outside of a very niche fetish festival. Not that it’s erotic. Cats is pure bestial horror, a companion piece to The Human Centipede, in which kidnap victims are stitched together, mouth to anus.This is all thanks to Hooper’s vision in attempting to hybridise actors and cats – a powerful caution that just because technology exists does not mean it should be used. While stage versions facilitate the illusion with wigs and leg-warmers, hirsute knickers and strategic muffs, the actors here have been stripped naked and digitally coated in fur. Every rippling contour is still on display, from Idris Elba’s peachy glutes to Taylor Swift’s wild thighs. Furry breasts are allowed – embraced, even – but all penises lopped off and every crotch homogeneously smoothed into a discreet hollow.Yet what Hooper taketh away he also, unhappily, giveth. What some characters might be missing from the front has migrated to the back. On stage, tails dangled meekly, here they flex, vast and erect, jutting out from all-too-human buttocks, quivering and straightening to reflect the character’s emotions.Cats is rated U: even the smallest tot is fine to see it. I would caution against this. Those children at the screening I attended appeared if not agog then certainly a bit confused. I asked the British Board of Film Classification whether they might not have been lenient. Nope, they replied: nothing sexy here, nothing you wouldn’t see on Strictly – plus: they’re cats! Any “freakiness” inferred by adults would never occur to kids.Fair enough. I’m just reading too much into it. Yet I can’t help but remember watching Rebel Wilson’s massive tabby ecstatically rub her tail between her legs before moving on to a string of uncooked sausages. She then frightens mice with children’s faces before unzipping her own fur to reveal beneath another layer of fur and some pink, sequinned lingerie.Nothing to see here. A festive treat for all the family."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/671cb37c02972824f2d823d86964a29ed7627758/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a51635d2b34b0d5a3fa92eed8b93896e","title":"extraordinary leader deliver labour party victory","story":"The right can get away with boring leaders. But for the left to end its losing streak, it must choose someone phenomenalThere’s a hard truth for anyone who stands on the left side of the political ide, a truth demonstrated again in recent days. Put starkly, the left usually loses. In the UK, Labour has governed for just 30 of the last 85 years. Of the eight men who have been president of the French fifth republic, only two have been socialists. In the postwar tally of US presidents, Republicans outnumber Democrats.There are countless reasons for this, but here’s one to contemplate in a week when the reality of a fourth consecutive election defeat for Labour slowly sinks in (very slowly in some quarters), and as Democrats contemplate poll numbers showing that even as Donald Trump becomes only the third president in US history to be impeached he still enjoys an edge over his leading Democratic rivals in the battleground states likely to decide the election next November.A look at recent electoral history suggests an uncomfortable pattern. Not only is the left’s default setting to lose it wins only when led by someone who is not merely good, but a phenomenon. In the US, it has taken a Bill Clinton or a Barack Obama – exceptional political communicators of once-in-a-generation talent – to break the Republican winning streak. In the UK, it took a Tony Blair – who all but the most stubborn critics will concede was an uncommonly gifted political operator – to become the only Labour leader born in the last 100 years to win a general election.There is an asymmetry here, for the right can win power without offering a leader who dazzles. For parties promising to maintain the status quo and keep things ticking over, a George Bush (junior or senior) or John Major will do. That rarely cuts it for the centre-left. Unless the country is recoiling from a predecessor so discredited that voters long for an antidote whose very ordinariness becomes appealing – think Jimmy Carter after Watergate or François Hollande after Nicolas Sarkozy – the party of change usually loses unless it is led by a candidate of extraordinary charisma.That’s also true of populist movements, who need a Trump, Matteo Salvini, Nigel Farage or Marine Le Pen figure at the top because, unlike regular parties of the right, “it’s all they’ve got. They can’t promise governing competence or stability,” says the Labour peer Andrew Adonis, who has studied leadership closely. But the burden falls especially heavily on the left. They are demanding the nation give up what’s familiar and head instead into uncharted territory. That requires a charismatic leader. For, to cite (again) the words of an old teacher of mine, the late Ze’ev Mankowitz, “People don’t believe in ideas: they believe in people who believe in ideas.”And yet, for a quality so determinative of political success or failure, it is maddeningly hard to define charisma, even if we feel we can spot its presence – or absence – in seconds. At its most basic, it begins with elementary communication skills. Would a TV channel choose this or that candidate to read the news? Applying that criterion to 1994, you’d have known in an instant that, had it come to a contest, Blair would have beaten Gordon Brown. Obvious.But there is so much more to it than that. Charisma is a shifting, evolving quality, changing in reaction to the times and especially to whatever has gone before. The tightly managed political style of the Blair-Clinton era left voters weary of candidates who were polished and spun, hankering instead for something apparently more authentic, even dangerous. Today the key TV test is whether you’d turn the sound up to hear what they say, not least because you wouldn’t be sure what was about to come out of their mouth.Trump is the master of that form of unpredictability Boris Johnson built a career on the frisson of appearing to defy convention and say things politicians aren’t meant to say. Of the current Labour field, the only candidate who even comes close to having that quality is Jess Phillips. Stewart Wood, the former adviser to Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, neither of whom were famed for their charisma, can see Phillips appealing partly because voters will know that “she’ll sometimes screw up and say the wrong thing. She’s visceral. She’s got that unstable, combustible mix”, which can be compelling.For a candidate of the right, that alone can carry you to victory. But it’s so much harder for the left. They have both to excite and reassure, all at the same time. Clinton, Blair and Obama succeeded partly because they calmed those who would normally be resistant to change. To take a niche, but illustrative example: in Israel, the centre-left has won only twice in the last 42 years, on both occasions when they were led by certified military heroes. Both Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak had the credentials to soothe any doubts about security. They were phenomena. Anything less, and their party loses.In less extreme form, it means a left challenger needs to exude gravitas and competence. The model here is Clement Attlee, who could reassure Britons in 1945 not least because he had been at Winston Churchill’s right hand as deputy prime minister throughout the war. What he lacked in sparkle, he made up in heft. His was the kind of anti-charisma offer Brown’s team were aiming to make with their “Not flash, just Gordon” slogan in 2007. We will never know if it would have worked in the election that never was, after which Brown’s image was no longer his to shape. But a left leader has to have at least one of those qualities – authority or charisma – and ideally both. (Supporters of Keir Starmer reckon his record as director of public prosecutions gives him a weight his rivals lack.)What complicates this further is that charisma can be in the eye of the beholder. To me, Jeremy Corbyn always looked like a glowering supply teacher, a man incapable of uttering a single memorable sentence, unable to command a room. In the campaign just gone, it became clear that millions of voters saw him that way too. Yet to thousands of Labour activists, he was an inspiration. What might account for this perception gap is a notion of charisma confined mostly to the left.Corbyn clearly met the post-Blair demand for an unspun, authentic politician, but he also cut a figure with deeper historical resonance. Ascetic, living modestly, with a scraggly beard trimmed only once he won the leadership in 2015, it was easy to see him as the archetypal prophet, summoned from the wilderness after decades spent living in isolation with only his principles for company. Never mind that he’s a boring or repetitive speaker: that only proves his consistency. Never mind the venom of his detractors or even the serial defeats: that only confirms him as a holy man who refuses to bend.Bernie Sanders has some of this appeal in the US, but here’s the key point: for all its roots in religious tradition, this is a form of charisma that today stirs only the left. Study the photograph on the front of Friday’s . It shows a gaunt Corbyn, staring fixedly ahead, alongside a chunky, Falstaffian Johnson, a mischievous smile on his lips. It’s an image as old as England, Roundhead against Cavalier - and we know which side the country reverts to in the end.Democrats need to hold this structural imbalance between left and right in mind as they choose their challenger to Trump. Unfair it might be, but to win that person will need to offer both excitement and solidity, hope and calm. It’s not an easy combination to pull off. Labour is in need of a similarly rare blend. But first it needs to decide what question it is asking. Is it looking for a leader who ticks all the members’ pet ideological boxes, or for someone who might prove capable of interrupting Labour’s long losing streak? By their choice, we’ll know whether they want to win – or to enjoy once more the martyr’s thrill of glorious defeat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74919f0539b9c7d843f2e3ccfda37da9074fec00/0_271_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cef11e932493e9eac3fa2607b8ddc060","title":"roas graffiti animals from around the world in pictures","story":"Belgian graffiti artist ROA is renowned for his colossal monochrome works of endemic and endangered animals adorning buildings around the world.

Why do some of the cats wear clothes? Even if it completely lacks a plot, there’s plenty to pick apart hereUsually with an article like this, I’d begin by warning you that the following contains plot spoilers. But I’m not sure whether this does or not, because this is an article about Cats. Cats does not have a plot.It has plenty of other things – it has singing, and dancing, and a bunch of cats who all uniformly look like discarded test subjects from a harrowing genetic splicing accident – but not really a plot. Unless you count “Some cats repeatedly introduce themselves at great length because their greatest wish is to be murdered in a Wicker Man-style death ritual”. Which you absolutely should not.But still, it is perfectly evident that Cats needs to be discussed. It needs to be discussed at length, because the only way to lessen the burden of our collective trauma is by sharing it. So with that in mind, here are the Cats moments that most sorely need to be dissected.Where are all the humans?Cats is set in London. It’s an easily identifiable London, full of buildings and statues and lights and advertisements. However, apart from the cats, it is entirely deserted. The streets are empty, the theatre abandoned. It’s eerie. Where did everybody go? My guess – and I’ll assume that I’m correct – is that in their pursuit of ritual murder, the cats turned against their owners and savaged them to death.Why was Rebel Wilson masturbating?Rebel Wilson is the comic relief in Cats, in that she falls over a lot, but her showcase number is honestly one of the most traumatic things I have ever witnessed in my entire life. For starters, when we first meet her, she is splayed out on her back with her hands between her legs, rubbing herself frantically. The sexuality of the cats in Cats is generally quite explicit – they’re all constantly about a microsecond away from humping each other – but Wilson’s self-pleasure is quite graphic for a U-rated film.Why did Rebel Wilson rip off all her clothes?Luckily, Wilson understands that we’d find the masturbation unsettling, which is presumably why she immediately does something far more terrifying. Halfway through her song, she stops and unzips herself, ultimately revealing that she was wearing a horrifying Ed Gein-style skin suit all along something that apparently provoked enough arousal for her to start masturbating. Chilling.Why do none of the cats have any sort of consistency when it comes to clothes?The attitude to clothing in Cats is baffling from start to finish. Rebel Wilson can unzip her own skin. Dame Judi Dench can wear a fur coat on top of her own fur. Mr Mistoffelees appears to be wearing a hat made of another cat’s skin, but also a regular blazer made of traditional cloth that he must have had tailored by another cat. Towards the end of the film, we meet a cat who for some reason gets to wear trousers and shoes. The sartorial feline world is the wild west, and every possible option is just as unpleasant as the last.Why did James Corden wince when he hit himself in the crotch?None of the cats in Cats have genitals. Which is weird, since some of them have breasts andor six-packs. So, when James Corden smacks himself in the crotch halfway through his song about how fat he is, why does it cause him so much intense pain?What the hell is going on with the other animals?I have to admit, this is my biggest issue with Cats. In the Rebel Wilson song, we meet other types of animals, and they’re also nightmarish part-human CGI hybrids. The cockroaches – again, complete with human faces and fingers – are one thing. But the mice in Cats will stop me from sleeping properly until the end of time. Because the mice are played by children. The cats are adults and the mice are children, and whenever one of the cats picks up a mouse to eat it, the mouse screams “NO! NO!” in genuine fear for its life. With a child’s voice. In the future, I guarantee that a serial killer will watch a supercut of the screaming Cats mice before going on a rampage. There is also a dog in Cats. It remains unseen. I will forever be grateful for this.Why does the film end with an etiquette lesson?Cats is essentially The X Factor for suicidal cats, which makes Judi Dench a version of Simon Cowell who is marginally less distressing to look at. Once the winning cat has been murdered, she breaks the fourth wall and sings us a song about the proper way for humans to look after cats. Why? Is she threatening us? We saw what she did to the cat who won the murder contest. We saw the lack of other humans in London. Was she warning us that we’d be next? Because, honestly, if the choice is being murdered by cats or remaining alive and having to thing about Cats any more, I’d take the former every time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1e8cf8d3a7ed7a1ac964fe27a8039323beea6d0/367_0_2798_1680/master/2798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed9bd61782907e6e29dc1a9b99bc6616","title":"nuclear nightmares belarus film festival against repression","story":"In a country where history casts a long shadow and authoritarianism reigns, a guerrilla festival team commandeer cinemas to champion liberty – if the KGB don’t get there firstIt’s the opening night of a film festival in Belarus, the forest country on the fault line between Europe and Russia that was devastated in the 20th century. Such evenings usually involve red carpets and movie stars, but this one features a black veil covering a big screen, like a mirror at an Irish wake.It’s a visual shock, something I’ve never seen before. Anti-glamour and morally serious, an electrifying start to a film festival. It makes me think of why I’m here. Thanks to the Russian company Atomstroyexport, Belarus is getting new nuclear reactors, so Watch Docs’ festival director, Tanya Hatsura-Yavorska, asked if they could show my film Atomic: Living in Dread and Promise, a collaboration with the band Mogwai. I loved the idea: the film has been shown near Chernobyl, in Coventry cathedral and in Hiroshima. As Belarus suffered more from the Chernobyl disaster than any country, it would be an honour.Watch Docs planned to show the film in conventional cinemas but, as they’re state owned, the Belarus KGB prevented the screening. Plan B – to show it somewhere atmospheric, like a disused bunker – was also stopped. As I watch the dance macabre on opening night, I still don’t know if Atomic will screen at all. Last night in my bedsit in Minsk, I woke up shouting. In my nightmare, men had broken in, like they arrive in Josef K’s bedroom in Kafka’s The Trial. I had nuclear nightmares in the 80s, but they stopped at the end of the cold war.On opening night, after the anti-capital punishment person, Hatsura-Yavorska speaks. She says Watch Docs is about the limits of freedom and un-freedom. Belarus has had the same president Alexander Lukashenko, since 1994. Authoritarian and dissent-averse, his country has vestiges of Soviet double-speak. She finishes, and the opening film begins. It’s The Trial, a documentary about the imprisonment of Russian-Ukrainian film-maker Oleg Sentsov. In it Sentsov – who has since been released – mocks the Russian legal system and laughs when his sentence is extended. It’s a film about being scared but not afraid, like Hatsura-Yavorska and her team – almost all women – are scared but not afraid. The confidence to cover the screen in black, to ask such serious questions about liberty and cinema. Compared with this, most film festivals look meagre and transient.Days pass. In Minsk’s massive museum of the second world war, I see clips from Elem Klimov’s shattering Belarusian war movie Come and See (recently restored and soon to be rereleased). Nazis herd villagers into a barn and then burn it. The clips are uncredited the museum plays them as if they’re documentary footage.We drive to Khatyn, where there is a memorial to the destroyed villages depicted by Klimov. Bells toll throughout the forest where the village once was. There’s a huge statue of the only adult to survive the atrocity – a man carrying his dead son. Altogether, 628 villages were eradicated by the Nazis. Up to a quarter of the country’s 9 million people are thought to have died. The lowest estimates are 1.5 million. I stand in this December forest, listening to bells that have rung for 50 years, trying to comprehend this. I fail.A day later, I hear that Atomic will be screened – in OK16, a huge railway workshop turned arts venue in the south of Minsk. Ten minutes before it starts, I still don’t know exactly where I’m going. But then I’m in an auditorium with beautiful projection and sound, and there’s a big audience – the power of Facebook – and Tanya is introducing. She says the festival “wanted to show this film somewhere more auspicious, but the three-letter organisation would not let that happen”.We watch Atomic. In its opening scene, a British government official in an old information film says to camera: “The government has decided that, in the present state of international tension, you should be told how to protect yourselves from the dangerous effects of nuclear attack.” It chimes with this place, and with this festival: being told what to do, the fear of thermonuclear disaster.Watch Docs uses films to express fear and push against it. I was scared in Minsk on that first night. After that, I was reminded why movies matter. Though protestors in Belarus risk imprisonment, they’re less scared than the three-letter organisation that tries to corral them. The KGB is afraid of their clarity of thought, seriousness and imagination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00c4d06ecd3039acbe933879ac92a79b320d2345/0_450_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bde506aab6671442a9d4196cc53d4499","title":"christmas sides anna jones recipes garlic cauliflower cheese tips ultimate roast potatoes","story":"Getting everything perfect and hot all at once can be tricky, so prepare what you can in advance, roasties includedIt’s the sides and sauces that make Christmas dinner. My advice: invest in doing a few really well. Most of us have one oven, which means getting everything golden, perfect and hot at once can be a juggle. So do yourself a favour and make sides that can be cooked in advance, put to one side then heated up at the last minute (in fact, if you don’t even get to the heating bit, they will still be delicious). This year, I will be making this cauliflower cheese, some roast potatoes and garlic- and lemon-sauteed greens. And, yes, I hear you ask, roast potatoes can be reheated – it’s how they do it in restaurants and they are all the better for it.I think sides on Christmas Day – and with any roast – should fit into three categories: fresh and green, crunchy and crispy, and indulgent and saucy. You should have at least one of each, and this is a saucy one. Confit garlic makes everything better, so I make a load and keep under oil in a jar in my fridge (I urge you to do the same).

Gently cook over a very low heat for 30 minutes, until the garlic is pale, soft and buttery inside but hasn’t browned. Be careful not to turn the heat up too much and boil, or the garlic and oil will burn: be patient, it will be well worth it.Leave the garlic to cool in the oil, then remove with a slotted spoon on to some kitchen paper, reserving the oil for later. This confit garlic is delicious simply spread on toast and will keep for a few weeks in its oil, if you want to make a few extra bulbs for another occasion.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over a medium-low heat, then stir in the flour until it forms a paste. Cook for a minute or so, then add the milk a little at a time, whisking continuously into a smooth, white sauce. Squeeze out the soft garlic from one of the bulbs into the bechamel sauce, add half the cheddar, gruyere and seasoning, and mix. It should be quite a loose: sauce it will thicken up as it bakes, so add a little more milk if needed.Arrange the cauliflower florets and some of the smaller leaves in a baking dish that will fit everything in nicely, then squeeze out the garlic from the other bulb into the spaces between the cauliflower. Pour the garlicky cheese sauce evenly over the cauliflower, then top with the remaining cheese.Mix the breadcrumbs with the lemon zest, remaining thyme leaves and chopped sage, then sprinkle over the cheesy cauliflower. Finally, spoon over some of the oil from the confit garlic and bake for an hour, until the cauliflower is soft and golden.For me, the linchpin of a good Christmas dinner is the roast potato: golden and crunchy on the outside, soft and cloudy inside. I am not normally a ‘rule’ kind of person – unless we are talking roast potatoes.• Start with good, floury potatoes: maris piper or king edward are both good.• I cook about three large potatoes per person, peeled and cut into roughly golf-ball-sized pieces at random angles, giving more edges to crisp up.• Blanch the potatoes in very well-salted, boiling water for 10-12 minutes, until almost fully cooked and soft on the outside• Drain the potatoes, then shake vigorously in a colander until the potatoes have a ragged, fluffy edge, which will mean golden crisp bits leave to steam-dry for five minutes in the colander.• Put five tablespoons of olive oil or butter in a large roasting tray, then put in the oven to get really hot before you add the potatoes. Be careful when you do, as hot fat can splash. Toss them in the oil and season well with salt and pepper.• Now is the time to add any flavourings. My favourite combinations are: a whole, halved bulb of garlic with rosemary sprigs and strips of lemon zestlots of flaky salt and two tablespoons of white-wine vinegar, A few bay leaves, sprigs of thyme and strips of orange zest or two lemons, zested, halved and added to the tray with a tablespoon of coriander seeds.• Halfway through cooking, lightly squash the potatoes with a potato masher, to give more surface area in contact with the tray, which means more brown bits.• Once the potatoes are crisp, golden and perfect, you can keep them in the roasting tray at room temperature, warming for 10 minutes in a hot oven just before you serve.• If you want to be really ahead of the game, the night before, you can blanch, season and tray up your spuds, tossed in a little oil to stop them discolouring. Keep in the fridge until 30 minuteutes before you want to cook."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/953f318dce2704efd16cfa66e4bdbdab0d072a0e/0_176_4721_2832/master/4721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c47f5037e0de6be9348facf94bd1b377","title":"arsenal appoint mikel arteta as manager to replace unai emery","story":"Mikel Arteta believes he is taking on a football club that has lost its way and that one of his first jobs as Arsenal’s head coach will be to help them regain their identity.The former Manchester City assistant was unveiled on Friday evening after signing a three-and-a-half-year contract and, in a hugely impressive opening mission statement, said he needed to understand the reasons why his new club – 10th in the Premier League – is in such a rut.“That’s what I’m sensing from the outside,” he said when asked whether Arsenal had become lost. “I would like to start to make some steps and start to understand the reasons why. There will be reasons behind it, and a history behind it, and I have to try to understand quickly why this is, to implement certain things that will be quick wins, for the players, the staff and everybody. That is the challenge now.“We don’t have much time to train, much time to talk about other things, because there are some important games coming up. We have to create the right vibe, the right energy, and everybody at the organisation has to feel so privileged to be here. There’s no other way.”Arteta saw the low mood around the Emirates Stadium at first hand last Sunday when City, at that point coached by him alongside Pep Guardiola, comfortably won 3-0. Within hours of the final whistle Arsenal executives were spotted outside his house in Manchester, with talks about his appointment at an advanced stage by then, and he explained that the negative vibes had struck him.“The first thing is a little bit to change the energy,” he said. “Last week I was here with Manchester City and I was a little bit down after the game when I felt what was going on. So we have to try to engage everybody, I have to try and convince the players about what I want to do, how I want to do it. They have to start accepting a different process, a different way of thinking, and I want to get all the staff and everybody at the club with the same mindset.”Asked whether he knew exactly what had gone wrong at Arsenal, he suggested that any negative elements would not last long under his regime.“I don’t want them hiding, I want people to take responsibility for their jobs and I want people who deliver passion and energy in the football club. Anyone who doesn’t buy into this, or that has a negative effect or whatever, is not good enough for this environment or this culture.”Despite that, his excitement at taking the role, which makes him the youngest manager in the Premier League at 37, was palpable. Arteta played for Arsenal from 2011 until his retirement in 2016 and described his return as a homecoming.“I’ve been back home,” he said. “I’m extremely happy and proud to have been given the opportunity to be the manager of this football club. I’ve been preparing for a few years for this challenge to come. I know the expectations, I know the level and I know the stature of this club, and what it deserves. So I’m ready for that challenge, I can’t wait to start working with the players, and everybody here at the club.”Arteta, who admitted that he came “a little bit close” to taking the job in May 2018 when Unai Emery pipped him, spoke warmly of Arsène Wenger’s influence on shaping his managerial career. It was Wenger who signed Arteta from Everton and fulfilled what the Spaniard said had been a lifelong dream to play for Arsenal.“There was one man, his name is Arsène Wenger, that believed in me and gave me the opportunity to play for this club,” he said. “After that, he made me captain of this football club and I wouldn’t be sitting here if he didn’t have the vision to give me the opportunity to enjoy this incredible club.”The appointment was confirmed just after 2pm and accompanied by a statement from the club’s head of football, Raul Sanllehi, who headed up the recruitment panel that alighted upon Arteta as first choice. Sanllehi also praised the interim head coach, Freddie Ljungberg, who has overseen five games and will take charge of Saturday’s fixture at Everton.“We met several top-class candidates and Mikel stood out to every single one of us as the perfect person for us,” Sanllehi said. “Mikel understands Arsenal football club and what it means to our fans around the world. We look forward to him getting down to work and bringing the best out of our squad as we work to get our season back on track.“I must also pay tribute to Freddie Ljungberg for his hard work and leadership. Together with Per Mertesacker, he has done a vital job for us in difficult circumstances. Freddie and Per are important parts of the Arsenal family and care deeply for this club.”Ljungberg’s future, and the makeup of Arteta’s wider coaching staff, will be confirmed in due course."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30a97bdf6f372162b2d92f76681504dbd6311129/59_20_3210_1926/master/3210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21446bc04cfefecc3ebf070d126631c7","title":"lionel messi guardian male world player 2019","story":"When Lionel Messi set off so did Diego Simeone, accompanying the run from the touchline. Drawn into what was unfolding before him, the inevitable conclusion edging closer, Simeone lurched and tensed and stuck his foot out as if willing his defenders to do the same until what he saw coming came. Messi bent the ball into the corner to score another late winner. The Atlético Madrid manager nodded, applauded and shrugged, arms outstretched, palms up, then clapped again: what ya gonna do? The following night Messi collected his sixth Ballon d’Or. “You deserve it,” last year’s winner Luka Modric said simply, handing it over.During Messi’s Ballon d’Or acceptance speech, he said the most significant thing he has ever said: he admitted retirement was near, time was running out. There was a desperation in the response that was eloquent, as if this was an idea too bleak to contemplate, the void too vast, but it had been said now and couldn’t be unsaid. He also said he was a “constructor”, not a goalscorer, which is true, but he has still scored more in the Champions League and La Liga than anyone, Golden Shoe winner for the sixth time, three in a row.But for what, people ask? What did Messi do? In the end, it was a disappointing year. Barcelona won only the league and reached the Champions League semi-final and the Copa del Rey final. Only.Messi has had many victims over the past 15 years, and one of them is him. Being a World Cup runner-up accredited Modric as the best being a World Cup runner-up is held against Messi, proof of failure. He was accused of being absent in May’s 4-0 defeat at Anfield – maybe they mean apart from the shot Alisson saved, the two that whizzed just past the post and the three clear chances made for Jordi Alba, Luis Suárez and Philippe Coutinho. In the Copa del Rey final, he scored one another, which would have been among the great final goals, hit the post.What did Messi do? He has played better than anyone else in 2019. Maybe he has played better than anyone else, full stop. And in the play, he is peerless. For all the tangibles, the astonishing stats, it’s not always tangible. A better measure of Messi might be sought in Simeone and reactions like his – in the men around Messi who comprehend him through competition. It might be sought less in what people said publicly, although there are some nice lines – a favourite is Jorge Sampaoli insisting that “comparing anyone to him is like comparing an average cop to Batman” – and more in what they did. Moments that are more spontaneous, more real.The day before Sampaoli’s Sevilla met Messi, one of his coaching staff privately admitted that preparation might prove pointless, “If he has one of those days”. The next day, he did, Sevilla’s president calling him an “extraterrestrial”. One of the most startling things about him is how often it is his day. When it’s not, it weighs even more heavily.That day in March, Messi got a standing ovation from the Betis fans. There had been a roar when he nutmegged one of their players. “There’s not much you can do against Messi,” striker Loren Morón said, yet Betis had won 4-3 at the Camp Nou four months earlier.“You have to plan for him,” says the Betis assistant manager, Eder Sarabia and the plan he outlines is profound. “In our case, the first part was to have the ball and press high,” he says. “You want Messi as far from your area and the ball as possible. It’s not just going past people, finishing he’s also the best assist provider in the world. He’s the best of all time and virtually every time. It’s incredible. It’s not only what he does, it’s what he’s thinking beforehand, how he is positioned, how he understands the play, makes others better.“On those days when you can’t stop him – and there are a lot of them – all you can do is admire him. The words that come out your mouth when he scores can’t be printed in the paper, but while you’re pissed off afterwards, you know it’s a privilege to compete with him. Like Pau, all of us will tell the story one day our entire lives, we’ll ‘boast’ about playing him. We’ll say: ‘We tried to stop him’ ... and most of the time we couldn’t.”Another opponent echoes the importance of preventing the ball even reaching Messi, closing pathways, shutting spaces, outlining personalised plans for him which aren’t repeated for other players. “The trouble is,” he says, echoing Ernesto Valverde’s suggestion that Messi spends the start of matches on a reconnaissance mission, mapping the game out, “Messi’s intelligent: he sees what you’re doing, where your priorities lie and, depending on that, goes inside seeking overloads, drops deep, heads to the wing. He’s also incredibly strong, extremely fast. You can’t knock him over: you hit him hard and you don’t put him off his stride. Physically he is brutal.“You handle him well and then, the one moment you don’t, he’s scored. So, there you see it.”Simeone may feel the same way it was late when Messi set off on that run two weeks ago. He was 50 yards from goal but the moment the ball reached him, Atlético’s manager could “smell” the danger and so could Messi. “Look at that goal,” Sarabia says. “Messi shapes the whole move he gives it to Suárez in a way that means he can only give it back as he does. It’s hard to stop him, whatever plans us coaches have. When Messi sets off, he already knows where he is going to score.”“With a goal like that all you can do is applaud,” Simeone said, and that was exactly what he did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/021c02b8d5f6aae8a6c5587d66b1a5c506ff3874/0_229_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97a542e096f70332391516bce3bad660","title":"macclesfield plymouth postponed ground safety league two","story":"Macclesfield can expect to face further sanctions from the Football League after Saturday’s League Two match with Plymouth was postponed late on Fridaynight.

Of these, 11,300 were between the ages of six and 14.Many children working as seasonal agricultural workers do not attend the beginning of the school year and, in 2018, an estimated 67 children and teens lost their lives while working, according to the campaign group the Centre for Child Rights in Turkey.In a statement to the , Ferrero acknowledged the problem of child labour in Turkey’s agricultural sector and said that they are “determined to prevent and eliminate child labour all along our supply chains”.Ferrero said it neither owned nor managed hazelnut farms in Europe, but worked with farmers to ensure good agricultural and social standards.“The complexity of the hazelnut supply chain means it cannot be transformed by one single actor,” said a Ferrero spokesperson. “Cooperation is absolutely essential to tackling the issue of child labour.”Interviews with child workers filmed by UK campaigning group WeMove Europe and the Centre for Child Rights, and seen by the , include children allegedly as young as 11 claiming that they are forced to work for up to 12 hours a day in the Black Sea region.The video contains other interviews with child labourers who say they work without contracts or adequate health and safety equipment.In the video, one 11-year old girl claims: “We walk to the field at 6.30am and start working at seven or 7.30am. We work until 6pm. This is the second time I have come to work here.”Another girl in the footage, aged 12, says she has been harvesting hazelnuts for two years.Farmers interviewed for the video claim that they sell their hazelnuts to Ferrero through intermediary companies.Last September, a BBC investigation found that Ferrero could not verify that all the hazelnuts in its supply chain were child-labour free.“The root of the problem is the price Ferrero pays for its hazelnuts,” said Giulio Carini, senior campaigner at WeMove Europe. “Our campaign asks Ferrero to support a fair price for hazelnuts in Turkey to ensure workers get a living wage income and eliminate child labour throughout its supply chain.”Founded as a family business in 1946, Ferrero is the third-largest company in the global chocolate confectionery market.The company employs more than 30,000 people and its sales have doubled over the past decade through ambitious acquisitions. In 2018, the company reported a turnover of €10.7bn (£9.1bn).In 2017, analysis by UK confectionery industry experts estimated that 130m Ferrero chocolates are sold in the UK every year.

So now I’m free to make my own festive traditionsOne quirk of my life is that I never celebrated Christmas as a small child. I was in secondary school when I put it to the family that, rather than doing what we normally did (nothing, but a worse-than-usual nothing because TV sucked and everything was closed), we should take the opportunity for some state-sanctioned downtime and bond.It wasn’t a hard sell (one thing I inherited from my mother is needing no excuse to party). The issue wasn’t religion or culture: it was scheduling. My siblings and I only had our mum growing up, and she worked in a shop Christmas Eve and Boxing Day were major shopping days and on Christmas Day she was beat. So I promised to take care of everything.Being 14, it was obviously an unmitigated disaster. I served prawns covered in ketchup and mayo in a mug (“Prawn cocktail,” I explained). I ruined my sister’s tights by cutting them up for stockings. I overloaded several extension cords with lights (the electrician was impressed: only true Christmasheads would have dinner by candlelight). It was probably quite tense, too, what with me shouting “Be jolly!” at anyone who dared to rest their face.In my family, Christmas remains “my” holiday. But I no longer feel the need to subscribe to a cookie-cutter version. This year, for the first time, I’ve delegated.

I must have been eight or nine, and it was the year my parents gave me a plastic green sledge. It was huge – by far the biggest present under the tree. I didn’t have the foresight or inclination to furtively feel what it was through the paper, and I have no memory of what I was expecting. But when I unwrapped it, I immediately burst into tears, which I think we can all agree made me an ungrateful little brat. In my defence, Christmas Day that year was – like so many – wet and grey, and I had only one very vague memory of British snow, so the present of a sledge seemed to taunt me with that mythical white Christmas a perfect day that I was already sure couldn’t exist.Once my tears had dried, I decided that I would never invest hope in Christmas presents ever again. I went on to become a lousy present-buyer and only marginally better at receiving them. There was something about the layers of expectation that floored me. The fear, resentment and waste of giving something that was unwanted only worsened in adult life. No one needs to add to the world’s woes with a dashed gesture of love.It occurs to me now that this may be why 12 years ago my mother gave me a present that was so blindingly good that it has changed every day since a present so particularly perfect that I wake up every day and in its folds of sweet softness find immense gratitude – for it and for my mother’s foresight and love.I felt then, and still do, that no present will ever come close to how excellent a jack russell puppy in a big red bow is. The whole of that Christmas is eclipsed by the flood of love I found the minute I saw her. How delicious she smelled, how excellent she looked in my coat pocket, how wonderful her excitable dance for each day made the mornings. We named her Isabel, which produced endless “Is a bell necessary on a bike?” jokes when I cycled to work each day with her in a basket.The first few nights away from my parents’ house, that small squiggle of a thing howled so loudly and so relentlessly that by the fifth night of no sleep, we brought her into our bedroom to see if that would offer some peace. She held out until she had got under the covers – and she has been there ever since. She wakes me most mornings by staring at me and sighing heavily at such a frequency that you can’t complain that she’s making a noise, but you can’t sleep through it, either. If this doesn’t work, she has learned to flap her ears so furiously that even the dead would be woken, and then practises a look of utter innocence. It’s a very good joke and even better on Christmas morning.Isabel wasn’t a surprise by any means – I’d been looking for a dog for some time. My mother just had the forethought to make me wait – in part, I’m guessing, to remind me of the magic of Christmas. I would love to say that I have subsequently become a great gift-giver I haven’t. But I do understand why you should strive to find something not necessarily expensive or extravagant, but that will be loved and cherished for years to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf77362441c815daf57350d9e6ada4566027a8ed/525_297_5232_3139/master/5232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a48f55ddf30ec6f5b8d2449e2f2b5cfb","title":"optimists make everything good writers thinkers hope","story":"Here’s hoping for new languages, better technology, solutions to the climate crisis, Samantha Mumba’s new album, a sequel to Hamilton – and the resurrection of hope itselfIt is hopeful when kids make up a language no one but their pals can understand.

I probably use the phrases “I hope this goes well” and “we can only hope” more than any others. Before I face a new audience, before I try out new material, before I record a television show. It’s a way of positively navigating the chaos of a life in entertainment without ever confronting what is essentially a mess of events that has no real order or sense. Other than that, it’s a laugh being a comic. I do like it, I swear. You can never truly know what an audience will be like (unless you are in Maidenhead, where they stare). You can only hope.My hopes for the next decade are depressingly personal and probably not global enough, however ashamed I am to admit that.

After all, what is hope but the deepest conviction that the future can be better than the present? As technological power grows and democracy stumbles, too many of us fall into numb passivity.

It reminds me too much of its own necessity. Let’s be honest, it’s not been a great year for some of the things I cherish, for the woolly cosmopolitan liberalism I’ve always worn as a warm jumper. But the opposite of hope, cynicism, I want to avoid, too, comforting as it is. In times like these I turn to something eastern European inside me: a shrug of doomed optimism. In my birth country of Ukraine I’ve learnt to love that shrug: it expects nothing good will happen, but knows things could be a lot worse, and that we might as well give it a go anyway.

They have permeated culture history, religion, science and technology to be a familiar and reassuring constant in our everyday lives. Quite simply, the apple is more than just a fruit. In fact, Brits buy more than 34,500 tonnes of apples each year (roughly 2.2m apples a week) at Tesco alone.And British apples are some of the best. In the UK, we have the ideal climate and weather to grow perfect pommes. Not only do we have the perfect growing conditions, but our apple growers are some of the most advanced in the world the British apple industry pushes innovation, using the latest technology and equipment to ensure only the tastiest of fruits.Growers include the family owned Adrian Scripps in Kent, which has been specialising in growing “top fruit” (meaning apples and pears) in the garden of England since the 1960s – and has supplied Tesco for more than 30 years. Working with Adrian Scripps, Tesco became the first supermarket to sell British apples all year.Managing director James Simpson explains: “We grow British apples to fill the shelves all year round: gala, discovery, braeburn, kanzi, red prince, jazz …”But apples are a seasonal fruit eating apples especially have a growing season approximately eight-weeks long, generally in September and October. Still, we’ve grown to expect them in our fruit bowls all year round. How do we bridge the gap?Simpson explains that technological advancements mean that British apples can be kept fresh for as long as eight months from the time of picking – stored from September or October right through to May or even June.To do this, the fruit is housed in cold stores (think giant fridges) holding hundreds of tonnes of apples. Here, Simpson and his team can control the atmosphere that the apples are kept in, specifically the natural gases.“The air we breathe is predominantly oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen,” he explains. “By lowering the oxygen level in the air, we can slow down the ripening process that the apples would otherwise go through.“Reducing the oxygen levels, which will ripen the fruit, and increasing nitrogen, which slows down the ripening process, sends the apples in to a dormant state – a form of deep sleep.”This process, which sounds like something straight out of Snow White, is called dynamic controlled atmosphere – a natural process to safely store the fruit until they are ready to be eaten. Simpson likens it to the maturing of cheeses or wines.“The number one priority for us is the eating experience for our customers ensuring we keep the flavour and crisp bite in the apples is the major focus to growers – creating the tastiest, ripest British fruit,” Simpson adds.This also means rotating the varieties on offer. “We work with Tesco to ensure that only the best of the season’s apples are on their shelves at any one time,” says Simpson. “This will change depending on which apple varieties are at their peak at any given time moving from the discovery, which is a more delicate apple and has a shorter store life, early in the season, through to the braeburn, which is hardier and can be stored for longer, later in the season.”Ensuring optimum taste isn’t only about seasonality it’s also about meeting customers’ changing tastes. Tesco sells approximately 50 British apple varieties, introducing new varieties each year, which is where John Worth, Tesco’s master of apples (no less) comes in. Together, Worth and Simpson trial and introduce new varieties of apple – taking up to five years to perfect a flavour.“Right now, customers are looking for great flavour and juiciness, combined with a satisfying crunch as they bite into it,” says Worth on the latest apple created with Simpson. “This meant crossing crisp, modern varieties with the flavour of older varieties. Working with James and his team, the result was the red prince variety: its flavour and texture are enhanced as the natural sugars and acids mature in storage, resulting in a wonderful crispness.”Of course, we can still buy apples from all over the world, but with our expectation for local produce continuing to rise and the need to reduce our global food footprint being more vital than ever, homegrown champions such as Adrian Scripps are defining what shoppers want – filling our baskets with a British bounty of the all-important, and not-so-forbidden fruit.As well as supporting its suppliers in implementing new techniques to enhance freshness, Tesco has an in-house “sensory panel” to help growers across all its fresh food in developing new, flavoursome varieties that taste great and thrive in British climes.

I’m out of sausage roll songs so I don’t know if we can do it again.”Using the melody to Joan Jett’s I Love Rock’n’Roll, the song is an ode to “a beige and savoury treat”, full of smutty double entendres and proud carnivorousness (“We’re not on a vegan diet  We know Quorn will never be a client”). It follows LadBaby’s 2018 No 1 We Built This City on Sausage Rolls, another pastry-themed hit sung to the tune of Starship’s 1985 hit We Built This City. I Love Sausage Rolls scored 93,000 chart sales (a figure combined from streams and downloads), 18,000 more than We Built This City in 2018.Proceeds from I Love Sausage Rolls are going to food bank charity The Trussell Trust. Chief executive Emma Revie told the  she was “so grateful” for LadBaby’s campaign: “The money raised will help us support our network of food banks to provide the best possible emergency help to people referred, while we work towards a future without the need for food banks.”Mark Hoyle, a graphic designer from Hemel Hempstead, first became famous for his candid YouTube diary videos documenting fatherhood and family life. As LadBaby, he and his family have 3.4m followers on Facebook, and in October signed a management deal with William Morris Entertainment and Margravine Management to help them branch out into merchandise, publishing and live events.Speaking to the , Mark Hoyle described visiting a food bank as “heartbreaking” and complained that the issue of food poverty had been overlooked for too long: “So much of the last few years has been dominated by Brexit and what’s happening with the government that so many issues – whether it be food banks or so many others – are taking a back seat because everyone’s focusing on that.”Stormzy’s single with Ed Sheeran and Burna Boy, Own It, is at No 2. The Croydon rapper was also kept off the top of the album chart, by Rod Stewart’s new release You’re in My Heart.Wham!’s Last Christmas reached the singles Top 10 for the fifth year running, but is still yet to top the chart – it was kept off No 1 by Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas? on its initial release in 1984, and also reached No 2 in 2017. Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You, which finally topped the US chart this week 25 years after its first release, couldn’t repeat the success in the UK – it reached No 8. Thirteen other Christmas songs, by the likes of the Pogues, Shakin’ Stevens and Michael Bublé, are in the Top 40.Despite a passionate social media campaign and support from the singer himself, Jarvis Cocker’s 2006 song Running the World could only reach No 48. The campaign to get it to Christmas No 1 had begun in the wake of the Conservative party’s election victory – the expletive-laden lyrics are a diatribe against the ruling classes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbe59a902e9bfedc054bd5994dfb2305ad896a68/0_237_3337_2002/master/3337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bbe5959e4115f342cbc82670f7acfc2","title":"ladbaby i love sausage rolls christmas no 1 charity food banks","story":"Singer says second consecutive Christmas No 1 charity single, released because ‘the country needs a laugh’, will benefit ‘everyday people’ forced to use food banksLadBaby’s I Love Sausage Rolls, a spoof of Joan Jett’s 1982 hit I Love Rock’n’Roll, has beaten Stormzy’s Own It to the festive top spot. It is the second Christmas No 1 for YouTube stars Mark and Roxanne Hoyle in two years, putting them in gilded company: the only other acts to rack up consecutive Christmas No 1 singles are the Beatles (1963 to 1965) and the Spice Girls (1996 to 1998). With 85,000 digital purchases, is also the fastest-selling download since the Artists for Grenfell cover of Bridge Over Troubled Water in June 2017.The young parents became famous through sharing irreverent videos about raising their two infant sons and now command an audience of 3.4m Facebook fans and 766,000 YouTube subscribers. In 2018, they pipped Ariana Grande and Ava Max to the Christmas No 1 with We Built This City on Sausage Rolls, a riff on Starship’s 1985 single.This year’s LadBaby campaign drew support from Stormzy, who described their mission as a “beautiful thing”, and Scottish musician Lewis Capaldi, who posted a characteristically unfiltered video of himself dancing topless to the song. Alan Merrill, who wrote and released the original song with his group the Arrows in 1975, said: “When I wrote it back then I could never have imagined this!”The proceeds from both singles benefit the Trussell Trust, a charity that supports more than 1,200 food banks in the UK. The money from last year’s single provided 70,000 three-day emergency food parcels. More than 823,000 parcels were distributed through food banks between March and September 2019, the busiest period on record.Emma Revie, chief executive at the Trussell Trust, said the charity was “so grateful” for the support: “The money raised will help us support our network of food banks to provide the best possible emergency help to people referred, while we work towards a future without the need for food banks.”The Hoyles recently visited a food bank and were surprised by the constant stream of people coming through the centre’s door. “It wasn’t always people that were destitute – it was everyday people, and that was quite shocking,” said Hoyle. “A window cleaner said that he had fallen off a ladder and broken his leg, which had led him to be there. We read so much about the problem but it’s different when you actually see it. It’s so much more heartbreaking.“There was a woman who came in with a little baby, probably about as old as ours, and when she left, the guy said, ‘It’s her 21st birthday tomorrow.’ How are we in this position where there’s a girl who’s 21 is going to a food bank because she can’t get food for her baby?”LadBaby released I Love Sausage Rolls the day after the UK election. Said Hoyle: “We were really worried about whether it would get lost in what was going on but I think the country needed something to have a bit of a laugh about. However people felt about the government, this song hopefully gave them a reason to laugh and a reason to donate to the people who needed it most.”Of the new Conservative administration, Hoyle said: “I’m sure they’re gonna do a great job.” Pressed on whether a government that introduced austerity would do anything to mitigate the issue of food poverty, he said that the nation had to have faith that “the right people” had been voted in. He declined to state who he had voted for, but clarified that he had voted, and that it was important to do so.LadBaby’s aim with the single, said Hoyle, was to offer a break from politics. “So much of the last few years has been dominated by Brexit and what’s happening with the government that so many issues – whether it be food banks or so many others – are taking a back seat. We didn’t want to involve politics at all, we wanted to focus on the people who can’t eat.”Hoyle was equally non-partisan on the matter of who makes the best sausage rolls, and said his sole requirement was that they were served hot. Although perhaps not vegan: I Love Sausage Rolls makes one explicit, if unexpected political point on the matter of the meat-free pastry snacks that have proven a sales winner for Greggs this year. The Hoyles sing: “We don’t want to start a riot  We’re not on a vegan diet  We know Quorn will never be a client.”Hoyle said: “When we spent some time with the Trussell Trust, we learned that the only thing people really get a choice in is allergies. They don’t have the luxury of saying whether they’re a vegan or a vegetarian – they just get what people have donated during that week. It’s a luxury to be in that position where you can choose.”Hoyle said the family was looking for more ways to help the Trussell Trust throughout the year. “We don’t want Christmas to be the one time when we help out. Summer is a really important time for them – that’s when their food banks are really depleted because there’s no school. Children don’t have free school meals and a lot of parents have to rely on food banks.”The Trussell Trust’s Emma Revie argued that a more robust benefits system was needed to reduce food bank reliance. “Poverty acts like a current, with big structural things – like the rising cost of living or insecure work – sweeping people away and leaving them without enough money for the basics. But this isn’t inevitable. We know what things will anchor people against those tides and reduce the need for food banks: a benefits system that provides sufficient money and support to anyone who needs its help, work that is secure and pays fairly and emergency support from local authorities that fills the gaps when someone is hit by something unexpected.”In October, LadBaby signed with William Morris Entertainment and Margravine Management to represent them across all areas of their business and expand their platform across licensing, merchandising, literary and live events, Variety reported. Hoyle said they had no specific plans as of yet. “I like to be places we’re not expected. I don’t know what else is next. I’ll pick up the phone to anything, so as long as it’s funny and we can make people laugh and spread a positive vibe, we’ll keep doing it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9992fffbb5c123a501988a6417e73c36b6e843ca/293_146_3704_2223/master/3704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=173ac8499d48e00e85e4a41125422e1b","title":"weatherwatch the science behind the sad dark days of solstice","story":"Why do we feel down in the dumps in the depths of winter? It’s not the cold it’s not the damp it’s hormonalThe sun is at its furthest south over the Tropic of Capricorn at 4.19am tomorrow, making the northern hemisphere’s winter solstice unusually late this year. For those with seasonal affective disorder, a depression usually caused by lack of sunlight, it is a milestone on the way to better times, but the length of the day affects us all. When exposed to the sun we produce less of a hormone called melatonin and so feel more awake and energetic.After dark the pea-sized gland in the brain that produces the hormone wakes up and releases melatonin into the blood making us feel tired and sleepy. This melatonin release lasts for about 12 hours, which accounts for why some people have difficulty getting up in the mornings, particularly at this time of year.In America melatonin is widely taken as an over-the-counter medicine to induce sleep, but in the UK the NHS is more cautious and will only prescribe it to over 55s with certain sleep disorders. It is the affect of light on melatonin production that leads to warnings about avoiding using computers and phones with bright screens in the hour before bed. Our brains are still working to the rhythm of sunlight and darkness and have yet to adjust to the invention of electric light.

It was designed by nine-year old Luis Walker, who has cystic fibrosis. He wrote to the politician earlier this year to highlight his fight to access the life-changing drug Orkambi. Inside the card, Walker wrote that his Christmas wish was “for everyone all over the world to get the medicine to make them feel better”.Meanwhile the chancellor, Sajid Javid, chose a card featuring his beloved dog Bailey – who shares his name with the soon-to-be governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey – sitting by his ministerial red box adorned with baubles and fairy lights.The Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon’s card highlighted the growing climate crisis. Designed by the musician Annie Lennox, it shows a polar bear perched on a melting iceberg.Commenting on the image, which will be auctioned in the New Year to raise funds for three charities, Sturgeon said: “We must continue to live up to our responsibility to tackle the global climate emergency.”The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, picked a traditional nativity scene on his Christmas card. The former deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, apparently used his card to plug his latest book release. While the front featured a snow-covered Christmas scene, the back of the card showed an advert for his new book, Downsizing, about his battle to lose weight in order to reverse his diabetes.Not to be outdone by politicians, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, issued their card on Friday showing the couple driving in a classic British car during their visit to Cuba in March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73432917b388e37243de370eb255162c4571f0a6/0_551_5824_3494/master/5824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1209db8b79e3d53f5fd232ed1a482991","title":"boeing starliner space capsule goes off course on first test flight","story":"Officials say spacecraft is in stable orbit but problem may delay mission to carry Nasa astronautsBoeing’s new Starliner capsule ran into trouble and went off course in orbit minutes after blasting off on Friday on its first test flight, a crucial dress rehearsal for next year’s inaugural launch with astronauts.Initially everything went flawlessly as the Atlas V rocket launched with the Starliner shortly before sunrise. But half an hour into the flight, Boeing reported that the capsule had not got into the position needed to get to the International Space Station.Officials stressed the capsule was in a safe and stable orbit. The Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted that the capsule burned up more fuel than planned and controllers were using its thrusters to raise its orbit.With less fuel on board, it put the rest of the flight in jeopardy. The Starliner was supposed to reach the space station on Saturday and remain for a week.Thousands of spectators gathered to witness Starliner’s premiere flight. The United Launch Alliance rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and was visible for at least five minutes, its white contrail a brilliant contrast against the dark sky. The mood quickly turned somber as news of the setback trickled out. Nasa officials deferred to Boeing for updates.“Safe and stable is the important thing right now,” Boeing spokeswoman Kelly Kaplan told reporters.This was Boeing’s chance to catch up with SpaceX, Nasa’s other commercial crew provider, which successfully completed a similar demonstration last March. SpaceX has one last hurdle – a launch abort test – before carrying two Nasa astronauts in its Dragon capsule, possibly by spring.A successful Starliner demo could have seen Boeing launching astronauts by the summer. But that might not be possible now.The US needs companies competing like this, Bridenstine said, to drive down launch costs, boost innovation and open space up to more people. He stressed the need for more than one company in case of problems that kept one grounded.The space agency handed over station deliveries to private businesses, first cargo and then crews, in order to focus on getting astronauts back to the moon and to Mars.Commercial cargo ships took flight in 2012, starting with SpaceX. Crew capsules were more complicated to design and build, and parachute and other technical problems pushed the first launches from 2017 to 2020. Last April, a SpaceX crew capsule exploded during a ground test.It has been nearly nine years since Nasa astronauts launched from the US. The last time was 8 July 2011, when Atlantis – now on display at the Kennedy Space Center – made the final space shuttle flight.Since then, Nasa astronauts have travelled to and from the space station via Kazakhstan, courtesy of the Russian Space Agency. The Soyuz rides cost Nasa up to $86m each time.Chris Ferguson commanded that last shuttle mission. Now a test pilot astronaut for Boeing and one of the Starliner’s key developers, he is assigned to the first Starliner crew with Nasa’s Mike Fincke and Nicole Mann. All three were at control centres to watch the launch.Built to accommodate seven people, the white capsule with black and blue trim will typically carry four or five. It’s 16.5ft (5m) tall with its attached service module and 15ft (4.5 metres) in diameter.For the test flight, the Starliner carried Christmas treats and presents for the six space station residents, hundreds of tree seeds similar to those that flew to the moon on Apollo 14, the original air travel ID card belonging to Boeing’s founder and a mannequin named Rosie in the commander’s seat.The test dummy – named after the bicep-flexing riveter of the second world war – wore a red polka dot hair bandanna just like the original Rosie, and Boeing’s custom royal blue spacesuit.The flight was designed to test all systems, from the vibrations and stresses of liftoff to the 28 December touchdown at the Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, with parachutes and air bags to soften the landing. Even the test dummy is packed with sensors.On the eve of the flight, Bridenstine said he was “very comfortable“ with Boeing, despite the prolonged grounding of the company’s 737 Max jets. The spacecraft and aircraft sides of the company are different, he noted. Boeing has long been involved in Nasa’s human spacecraft programme, from Project Mercury to the shuttle and station programmes.Boeing began preliminary work on the Starliner in 2010, a year before Atlantis flew for the last time.In 2014, Boeing and SpaceX made the final cut.

Its winners often go on to run well at the Festival less than three months later, but -generally do so without ever seriously threatening to trouble the judge.Master Debonair could yet prove to be another of those nearly-horses. He did enough in an eight-length defeat of the odds-on Ribble Valley, though, to suggest that a place in the frame at least will not be beyond him in March.Robbie Power seized the initiative immediately on Colin Tizzard’s gelding and barring a slightly clumsy leap at the final flight, never looked likely to surrender the lead. Ribble Valley, possibly the best two-mile novice on the northern circuit with a couple of clear-cut wins under his belt already, travelled well enough but looked painfully laboured by comparison with Master Debonair when asked to pick him up.Heavy ground at right-handed Ascot is unlikely to bear much -resemblance to the conditions at the spring Festivals, but Tizzard is already plotting a path through the big meetings next year with only one more stop for Master Debonair before the Supreme, for which he is now quoted at around 20-1.“He’ll have one more run and then go for the Supreme. There’s been talk about running in a handicap but I’d love to keep him to novices this season to keep him fresh for Cheltenham, Aintree and Punchestown.”Angels Breath was the winner of this race 12 months ago and set off as a well-backed 6-1 chance in the Supreme Novice Hurdle in March, but finished only seventh of 16 -runners. Ascot, however, seems to suit him perfectly and he took his record here to three-out-of-three as he beat a solitary opponent in the Grade Two Noel Novice Chase.The victory came at a cost, however, as Angels Breath was dismounted on the track and returned with a cut on his off-fore leg.Some participants in the buying and selling of bloodstock in Britain are “in practice, entirely unregulated” and the whole process is in urgent need of “transformational and once-in-a-generation change”, according to a long-awaited report into sales industry practices published on Thursday.The report, commissioned by the British Horseracing Authority and conducted by Justin Felice OBE, a former chief superintendent of Lancashire police, includes recommendations that all bloodstock agents should be licensed and that the BHA should take on overall responsibility for the regulation of bloodstock sales.This, in turn, “would be likely to seriously damage the bloodstock industry’s reputation”.The report lists four practices – secret profiteering, dual representationcommission, “luck” money and bidding up – which, though not described as being “endemic” in the sales process, are “unethical” and, in some cases, “potentially criminal” breaches of the Bribery Act (2010), the Fraud Act (2006) or the Criminal Law Act (1977).Secret profiteering involves collusion between a bloodstock agent and a vendor to ensure that a purchaser pays more than the market value for a horse, with the agent and vendor splitting the difference.Many of the “improper practices” detailed in the report can involve bloodstock agents, whose activities – along with those of other stakeholders in the bloodstock industry – are currently self-regulated via the Bloodstock Industry Code of Practice, which was most recently updated in 2009.The BHA, Felice says, should in future take charge of the regulation of all participants in the bloodstock industry, replace the 2009 code with a new version, which is “more robust and fit for purpose”, and introduce a licensing system for agents, with sanctions including fines and suspensions from auctions imposed for breaches of the rules."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91618cc76f3a7f7974f59402fe78d5db14d3b311/0_277_2361_1416/master/2361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbcd4d48fc4c36ad9b6f5d812d7d66ef","title":"my blueprint for 2020 ugo monye six nations","story":"Rugby has much to build on after a thrilling year but clarity on calendars and wages is needed plus more attacking gameplansAt the very top of my agenda for the new year is a commitment to everyone involved in the game in this country to build on the excellent work done by England at the World Cup. We saw a spike in terms of welcoming more people into the game after 2003 but what I really want to see is a greater ersity of people coming into rugby. I’ve said it plenty of times before because it is something I’m really passionate about but a third of the England squad in Japan were from BAME backgrounds. On the back of that I would love to see rugby grow and develop in areas such as inner cities as well as the traditional heartlands.Law amendments. Where to start … if I were to make just one change it would be in an effort to reduce the amount of time wasted over reset scrums. During Exeter’s win over Sale last weekend it took four and a half minutes for one scrum to be completed. Stopping the clock could help but I also think that taking away the option of selecting another scrum from a free-kick could make a difference. Caterpillar rucks can also go too – no league likes to box-kick more than the Premiership and it is having an adverse effect.Surely now is the perfect time to bring a greater transparency to the Premiership salary cap. I appreciate that a review of the regulations was recently announced but there is still a 103-page document sitting in Premiership Rugby’s offices and it is not publicly available. As far as I’m concerned, Saracens’ breach happened, they have been punished and it is time to move forward and the best way to do that for all the clubs is with as much transparency as possible. We often say it is a game for the fans but sometimes I wonder if they are given the full picture.When England return to Japan for a two-Test tour in the summer it will be with an unfamiliar squad. There is every chance that not a single player involved in the World Cup will be involved. That presents Eddie Jones and a lot of players with an opportunity but the one thing I do not want to see is wasted caps. I look to the 2017 tour of Argentina when so many players were away with the Lions and some of that squad have just disappeared. Will Collier has not been seen for England since, nor Jack Maunder, and Denny Solomona has been in and out. A lot of the responsibility lies with the player – if you are given an opportunity you have to take it – but Jones must also avoid wasting caps and, if he picks players who are not contributing to England over this four-year cycle, then it is a waste.In the coming months we have a fascinating Six Nations to look forward to with so many new coaches involved, followed by the business end of the club season. In each competition I want to see attacking rugby prevail. I wouldn’t begrudge Wales their 2019 grand slam – Shaun Edwards has always said that defence wins championships and he is so often right – but they had the second worst attack in the tournament. During the pool stages at the World Cup it was all about Japan and the speed and style with which they were playing. But then in the knockout rounds it was pragmatism and defence. At the moment I’m loving watching Racing 92 and Leinster in the Champions Cup, Bristol and Northampton in the Premiership. It is often the case that a winning team provides the blueprint for many others to copy. In 2019 one would have to say that was Wales and South Africa but next year I hope it’s a team that favours an attacking brand that sets the example.Changes are clearly afoot when it comes to the global calendar – CVC have spent an awful lot of money for a seat at the top table – and some improvements can undoubtedly be made. It’s incredibly tough, like trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube with one hand, but let’s put the players front and centre. Players always want to know what is going on in the future. I think we’re moving towards a British and Irish league as well as a world club cup and that would have connotations for a revamped, perhaps streamlined, Champions Cup. If all the stakeholders can get together and iron out a global calendar that has the players at heart, perhaps by introducing a Christmas break, then rugby will be the better for it. In that calendar we need to build on the success stories of the World Cup. Japan simply have to join either the Six Nations or the Rugby Championship but there also needs to be a way for teams like Georgia and Fiji to have year-round access to matches against the top 10 teams in the world. And let’s do away with the term “tier-two” for good.One particular incident at the World Cup showed that referees are coming more and more into the spotlight: Jaco Peyper’s misguided photo where he imitated the elbow by Sébastien Vahaamahina that earned him a red card against Wales. They are in the spotlight more because, on top of everything, they are in effect broadcasters as well. Everything they say is broadcast on TV and inevitably they are scrutinised more. Supporters will always want to hear more, know more and get greater insight but my concern is that it has gone too far. In commentary I have a button – we call it the lazy button – and I can use it to talk to a producer or a director to ask for replays and I can have that conversation without it being broadcast. I think TMOs need that same button so they can speak to the referee and say: “For the last couple of minutes everyone has been offside – you might just want to have a look at that.” I don’t think we see as many interventions from TMOs because every word is broadcast and it is becoming counterintuitive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b86ba68cf8d664e456fee6d4e18ce675933a3815/0_34_1154_692/master/1154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20086d1d6bae17e91af3cb8fcd4d6da","title":"youtube highest earner eight year old guan ryans world","story":"Gaun’s online video channel, Ryan’s World, has 23 million subscribers and raked in $26m last yearAn eight-year-old YouTube presenter has topped its list of high earners, making $26m last year.Ryan Kaji (real name Gaun) made his toy review empire unboxing toys on YouTube from when he was just three.

Combining the grim realities of true crime with a thriller-like pace, its third instalment is particularly enraging, detailing the process by which Italian model Ambra Gutierrez participated in a police sting against the movie mogul – only to find serious allegations levelled against her.What we said: Farrow hosts this illuminating, terrifying audio accompaniment to his book about a network of high-powered Hollywood abusers, chief among them Weinstein. Having won a Pulitzer for his work in bringing the story to light, Farrow’s credentials are evident. Here, however, we discover just how menacing a process it was.Available on Spotify and Apple PodcastsA musical about a man with cancer who is crowdfunding for treatment might not sound like a barrel of laughs. But this series from John Cameron Mitchell – creator of rock opera Hedwig and the Angry Inch – is a heartrending and hilarious combination of music, theatre and drama, with standout performances from Glenn Close and Cynthia Erivo.What we said: The junction where podcasts and musicals meet is not a place for everyone, but Mitchell’s new creation is definitely worth a listen. Yes, it’s strange, but the songs would stand up on any stage and the story’s a compelling one.Available on Luminary2019 saw the end of BBC Three’s always hilarious and often harrowing sitcom People Just Do Nothing, which was indebted to the UK’s suburban garage scene as much as it was to The Office. But the Kurupt FM crew weren’t off the airwaves for long, swiftly returning with a podcast. From music to relationships to “the supernatural” (featuring DJ Beats’ “sixth seventh” and a market-stall Ouija board), it’s a lovingly ludicrous ride.What we said: If People Just Do Nothing’s faux-interview segments and cold sweat-inducing cringe comedy strongly recalled The Office, the podcast sees the lads draw from a different giant of the sitcom world. Bathos-laden broadcasting, aimless chat filler and awkward phone-ins: there is a lot of Alan Partridge’s DNA here.Available on AudibleThe story of how a Canadian man, Benjamin Faulkner, masterminded a huge ring of dark web paedophiles is chilling, but this brutal and brilliantly-told story of how police and journalists teamed up to stop him is more unbelievable still.What we said: An undercover journalist travels almost 10,000 miles to confront two men who, he has reason to believe, are responsible for hosting some of the most horrific and disturbing imagery on the internet – and is met with two unlikely suspects. So begins this often difficult to stomach yet compelling six-part podcast from Canadian broadcaster CBC and Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang.Available on Spotify and Apple PodcastsComedian Cariad Lloyd’s podcast about death and what it means for those left behind has become a cult favourite over the past three years. Alongside famous faces – from fellow comic Aisling Bea to actor Susan Wokoma – Lloyd has explored often unspoken death-themed topics, including child loss and death doulas. It’s the perfect antidote to taboo, with a forthcoming companion book recently the subject of a 15-way bidding war between publishers.Available on Spotify and Apple PodcastsA riveting podcast that tackles the issue of our time: the ticking time bomb of climate change. Helmed by Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the UNFCCC, it cuts through the fear while emphasising the severity of the emergency. It also has impressive form when it comes to guests, having featured everyone from David Attenborough to Greta Thunberg.Available on Spotify and Apple PodcastsAccording to host Greg Jenner, You’re Dead To Me is “a history podcast for people who don’t like history … or at least people who forgot to learn any at school”. That means finding out about more than just the world wars, with the historian covering everything from gay conversion therapy in 1950s America to pyramid demolition during the Crusades. An ideal alternative to trawling through history books.What we said: This amusing new podcast follows TV outings such as Drunk History and Horrible Histories in making the past that bit more exciting. Historian Jenner, who helped to make the latter show, hosts alongside experts including Dr Helen Castor, a medieval historian who helps to explain the remarkable story of Joan of Arc.Available on BBC SoundsA hit podcast made in the most unlikely of settings: California’s San Quentin prison. Created by university professor Nigel Poor and inmate Earlonne Woods, the show explores everything from dating after several years inside to the reality of ageing behind bars. Intriguing, different and frequently moving, the podcast is now hosted by Poor and another San Quentin resident, Rahsaan “New York” Thomas.What we said: It has been a while since the last season of the podcast that takes you behind bars in San Quentin prison and that’s because things have changed, with host Earlonne Woods now released. Available on Spotify and Apple PodcastsFollowing on from the success of her non-fiction book, Animal, Sara Pascoe’s second tome, Sex Power Money, saw the comic dissect the sex industry – from the ethics of sex work to the science of male sexuality and the racial dynamics of porn. This companion podcast is equally insightful, taking in themes as ergent as the history of that much-feared medical instrument, the speculum, and sugar babies, whose lifestyles are funded by wealthy, often older partners.What we said: At the beginning of comic Sara Pascoe’s podcast about sex work, stripping and porn, she admits she doesn’t know enough about it. Which means she asks a lot of pertinent questions as she investigates further, hitting just the right tone. Her interview with social historian Hallie Rubenhold, ostensibly about Jack the Ripper’s crimes, is far-reaching and fascinating.Available on Spotify and Apple PodcastsHelmed by a group of confident, smart, hilarious young women of colour, The Receipts has rightly become a runaway success, going from independent hit to a Spotify cosign with a TV pilot in the works. From mental health to sex, with confessions from hosts and listeners, it’s the most fun you can have without seeing your actual friends. Bonus points for the episode titles, which include The Art of Dry Humping and How Do I Tell My Boyfriend to Clean His Toilet?”What we said: Audrey (AKA Ghana’s finest), Milena and Tolly T of The Receipts podcast have become the friends you never had, and the sisters you’ve always wanted. And this summer they have become familiar faces thanks to the billboards that have been popping up since their recent transfer from BBC 1Xtra to Spotify. Exploring pop culture, social issues affecting women of colour and random thoughts that capture the humour in the mundane.Available on SpotifyImagine a counselling session where the audience isn’t just a single person but an infinite number of listeners: that’s the premise of Esther Perel’s Where Should We Begin. In it, the couples therapist navigates issues from infidelity to illness and sex addiction with a no-nonsense but empathetic approach. She has also recently extended her advice towards coworkers with a new show, How’s Work?Available on Spotify and Apple PodcastsIs there anyone more nerdily charming than Adam Buxton? To listen to his podcast introductions, delivered nonchalantly while walking his dog, is to feel instantly relaxed. The comic’s off-the-wall interview podcast started 2019 with David Mitchell and ended it – as if things couldn’t get more surreal – with Jeff Goldblum. Setting the gold standard for comedy podcasts, expect only the most glorious waffle.Available on Spotify and Apple PodcastsThe first two series of this podcast by US news site Slate told the story of the Watergate scandal and the impeachment of Bill Clinton. But the third series branched out into an altogether different kind chapter in US history: the unsolved murders of rap titans Tupac and the Notorious BIG. Dark, ambitious and full of insight from the people who were there, this was the opposite of a slow-burn hit.What we said: In the new series of Slow Burn, Joel Anderson describes in vivid detail the events surrounding the shooting of Tupac Shakur at the Quad Recording Studios in 1994. But this is not a eulogy. In the opening lines, Anderson reminds us that on the night of his shooting Shakur was on trial for sexual assault. Episode one fuses feuds, legal battles and brash masculinity – all the expected ingredients of any good hip-hop story.Available on Spotify and Apple PodcastsSpoken word star and rapper George the Poet returned this year with a second series of his smash pod that combines drama, poetry, music and politics. Touching on rap stars, Grenfell, estate turf wars, the slave trade and much more, his show moves from fantastically funny to intensely emotional, while always remaining intriguing.What we said: The winner of five British Podcast awards, spoken-word performer and writer George the Poet delivers an experimental, stereotype-busting, immersive audio shows. In the first episode, he considers in verse how mainly white audiences are used to mining black artists’ trauma as if it were “a fossil fuel”, before taking a look at a test case via Reaganomics, rap and blaxploitation.Available on BBC SoundsEd Gamble and James Acaster continue to enthral listeners with their foodie Desert Island Discs, in which guests talk rapturously about their favourite grub and fond food memories. From Observer food critic Jay Rayner to soon-to-be Marvel star Kumail Nanjiani and Fleabag’s Sian Clifford, they’ve had a huge range of guests – and a glut of heartwarming, hunger-inducing chats.What we said: Ed Gamble and James Acaster host this delightful podcast all about imagining your ideal meal, a concept which lends itself nicely to conversations on everything from identity and class, to whether the “share” in “tear and share” garlic bread is optional, as Scroobius Pip suggests.Available on Spotify and Apple PodcastsBest known for his deep es into everything from psychopathy to public shaming, Jon Ronson made a foray into porn with his 2017 podcast The Butterfly Effect. He returned to the adult industry with this dark, disquieting take on true crime, examining the mysterious suicide of a young porn actor, August Ames, just a day after she was accused of online homophobia.What we said: A sparing, delicate and at times harrowing series, ostensibly about the suicide of August Ames, who killed herself at the age of 23. If The Butterfly Effect humanised an unknown industry for its listeners, this seems more willing to confront the dark side of that world.Available on AudibleA confident entrepreneur, a hard-working young woman with a degree from Oxford, an audacious scam artist: as Jamie Bartlett and Georgia Catt find out in their gripping podcast, Ruja Ignatova was all of these things and more. A wild ride through the wild west of cryptocurrency combined with a personal tale and held together by a specially composed score by the London Bulgarian Choir.What we said: Dr Ruja Ignatova was the polished entrepreneur with an impressive CV and an even more impressive claim: that her OneCoin cryptocurrency would overtake Bitcoin and make its investors rich. Unfortunately for those who did invest, her business turned out to be a scam, leading to the “very very very scary” tale our podcasters explore.Available on BBC SoundsShe’s the rhinestoned superstar known for a string of country-pop hits, but Dolly Parton is also an American icon, and a symbol of unification in an increasingly fractured society. Radiolab host Jad Abumrad helms this exploration of Parton’s personal journey as “a quivering mass of irreconcilable contradictions”, made with love, care and unparalleled access to the woman herself.What we said: Dolly Parton’s America is the result of much digging, research and time spent speaking to the star herself. Abumrad has also interviewed Parton’s confidantes and managers, celebrities such as Jane Fonda (with whom she starred in the film 9 to 5) and ordinary Americans “who have taken her into their souls”. The podcast is as much about Parton as it as about the nation.Available on Spotify and Apple PodcastsThe all-out grossness and thoroughly grim goings on in the wickedly judgmental therapists’ office was a podcast highlight of 2019, with an increasingly not-safe-for-work feel. Incest, unexpected fluids, nonplussed bereavements and workplace wanking all featured, with a special mention for the husband breastfeeding from the au pair. Foul, in the very best way.What we said: Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine’s judgmental, disgusting and thoroughly convincing agony aunts return for another series of the hilarious podcast. Cringe-inducing wisdom is the core of their business, whether they’re telling women over 35 not to have wrinkly babies or warning them to tend to their husband’s “physical needs”.Available on Spotify and Apple PodcastsElizabeth Holmes was a young, highly successful entrepreneur whose company, Theranos, was valued in the billions and looked set to transform the world of medical testing for the better. There was just one problem: her company was a sham. Wall Street Journal writer John Carreyrou was one of the first to cotton on to the truth behind the woman billed as the next Steve Jobs, countering her claims with a series of dynamite articles and later writing a book – Bad Blood – about Holmes. The Dropout, hosted by ABC News reporter Rebecca Jarvis, takes Carreyrou’s story and builds it into a high-octane tale of mass deception, a frightening cult of personality and a fraud that even drove a wedge through one investor’s family and sucked in the medical industry. A feat of investigative journalism, the six-part series serves as a stark reminder of the malleability of truth, and the arrogance and hubris that can reinforce it.Available on Apple Podcasts"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4121887.1576864276!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit british mps resoundingly approve eu withdrawal agreement","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson sitting among Conservative colleagues in the House of Commons on Friday. Photograph:   Jessica TaylorUK ParliamentAFP via Getty ImagesMPs have voted overwhelmingly in favour of Boris Johnson’s plan to take Britain out of the European Union at the end of next month, passing his Withdrawal Agreement Bill by 358 votes to 234, a majority of 124. Six Labour MPs voted with the government and 32 abstained in a vote that marks the end of parliament’s three-year conflict over Brexit. \u0026nbspThe DUP, the SDLP and Alliance voted against the Bill and MPs from all three parties expressed concern about the impact of its provisions for Northern Ireland. Mr Johnson said the Bill, which will complete its passage through parliament in early January, should not be seen as a victory for either side in the Brexit debate.“This is the time when we move on and discard the old labels of Leave and Remain. In fact, the very words seem tired to me, as defunct as Big Enders and Little Enders or Montagues and Capulets at the end of the play,” he said.The prime minister defended the changes he made to the Bill since the election, including a prohibition on extending the post-Brexit transition beyond December 2020.“If we have learnt anything from the experience of the last three years, it is that drift and dither means more acrimony and anguish,” he said.“And there would be nothing more dangerous for the new future that we want to build than allowing the permanent possibility of extending . . . the implementation period in a torture that came to resemble Lucy snatching away Charlie Brown’s football,\u0026nbspor Prometheus chained to the Tartarean crag, his liver pecked out by an eagle and then growing back . . . only to be pecked out again in the cycle repeated forever.”Child refugeesJeremy Corbyn described as “appalling” the government’s decision to abandon a commitment to work with the EU to admit unaccompanied child refugees to be reunited with relatives.“Shame on this government for abandoning children in this way,” he said.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, who is expected to be among the candidates to succeed Mr Corbyn as Labour leader, said that although his party had lost the general election, it must not lose its beliefs.“As a result of the majority that the government have and the mandate that they have, we are leaving the EU. We will have left the EU within the next six months, and whatever side we were on, or even if we were on no side at all, the Leave-Remain argument will go with us.“That does not mean that the deal negotiated by the prime minister is a good deal. It is not. It was a bad deal in October when it was signed, it was a bad deal when it was first debated in the House in October, it was a bad deal last Thursday, and it is a bad deal today. In fact, it is worse today,” he said.“The changes the government have made – weakened protections for workplace rights, a sidelined parliament and weakened protections for child refugees – tell us everything we need to know about the prime minister and this government, their priorities and their values.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

No it is not.”   Photograph: Pacemaker PressThe consequences of last week’s general election on the shape of the House of Commons are most visible on the government benches, which can no longer accommodate the multitude of Conservative MPs.Yet the changes on the opposition benches were more striking as MPs debated the queen’s speech on Thursday, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats shrunken and despondent, while the resurgent Scottish National Party (SNP) was alight with confidence and purpose.The DUP is diminished in number and in influence, now surplus to requirements for the Conservatives and no longer the only party from Northern Ireland to take their seats in the Commons.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, who was elected last week along with Claire Hanna and the Alliance’s Stephen Farry, wasted no time in making a maiden speech on Thursday that alerted MPs on all sides that a formidable new voice has arrived at Westminster.He told the chamber that he stood there as an Irish nationalist. “In fact I stand here because I’m an Irish nationalist, not in spite of it, because I believe that every single person in all of our constituencies needs to be properly and fully represented. So I’m glad to be here.“But we are not narrow nationalists. We come from the tradition of Parnell and Hume. Our vision is big and it is broad, and our mission is to unite all of our people, not ide them any further. So we intend to represent nationalists, unionists and everybody else.”After that assertion of the contrast between the SDLP’s approach and Sinn Féin’s abstentionism, Eastwood turned his focus on the DUP, whose MPs were sitting on the bench below him.He described Boris Johnson’s approach to Brexit as reckless, accusing the prime minister of driving a coach and horses through the Belfast Agreement.Brexit agenda“I’m glad to see now that the DUP are very concerned about the checks between this island and our island. It’s a pity they didn’t think about that when they drove the Brexit agenda, when they rejected Theresa May’s deal, and now we’re in a situation that none of us are happy with. We’re in a situation that every one of us should be trying to reverse and reject.” \u0026nbspA few minutes earlier the DUP’s Sammy Wilson had praised Johnson for delivering Brexit, but asked the prime minister to use the authority his 80-seat majority gave him to wring some changes from the EU over the next year.Nothing the prime minister negotiates next year will change the withdrawal agreement bill MPs will debate on Friday, and that will pass all its stages in parliament by the middle of January. \u0026nbspThe bill implements the Northern Ireland protocol that will oblige Northern Ireland to follow EU regulations and customs rules after Brexit, creating a regulatory barrier in the Irish Sea. The DUP’s new leader at Westminster, Jeffrey Donaldson, appeared to acknowledge that the game was up, asking the government to take steps to limit the damage. \u0026nbsp“Many of the issues that need to be addressed to mitigate the impact of the consequences of the withdrawal agreement are internal to the United Kingdom. And there are measures that the government can take to mitigate the impact on the Northern Ireland economy and Northern Ireland business. And what we’re seeking from the government is a commitment to do that so that it benefits the whole of the United Kingdom.” \u0026nbspThe queen’s speech promised legislation to protect former soldiers from “vexatious” prosecutions for actions they took while on active service. The measure is popular among Conservative backbenchers and has long been championed by the DUP.Can of wormsHowever, Eastwood warned the government about the can of worms it was preparing to open. \u0026nbsp“In 1972, 14 innocent civil rights marchers were gunned down by the British army on the streets of Derry. Is prosecuting those veterans vexatious? No it is not.“We will resist this attempt to undermine our peace process and our political progress and this insult to victims, all of the victims of our terrible, terrible past and the opportunity that has been denied to them since 1998 to find full truth and full justice.“We stand by every single one of those victims no matter who the perpetrator was. And people on the benches opposite need to understand this: if you begin with an amnesty for the British army you will end up with an amnesty for everybody.” \u0026nbspIan Paisley had a friendly exchange with Johnson earlier over the prime minister’s enthusiasm for a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland, a proposal Wilson also praised as a concrete symbol of the integrity of the Union. \u0026nbsp“They want to build a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland,” Eastwood said.\u0026nbsp“Well, they’d be much better suited building a decent road from Belfast to Derry.”Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

Photograph: HOPRUAFP via Getty ImagesIn his 36 years as a Conservative MP, Roger Gale has been called any number of things, branded a bigot for his opposition to same-sex marriage and a misogynist for referring to his female staff as “girls”. But it is safe to say that until Friday, he had never been addressed as Leas-Cheann Comhairle.As acting deputy speaker, Gale was in the chair when Alliance’s new MP for North Down Stephen Farry rose to make his maiden speech.“I wanted my first formal comments in this chamber to be in Irish to reflect the shared heritage of the language across all the traditions in Northern Ireland.”The DUP’s Gregory Campbell was not in the chamber to hear Farry’s words, which were almost identical to those that drove the East Londonderry MP in 2014 to open a speech to the Northern Ireland Assembly with the words “Curry my yoghurt can coca coalyer”.Moral authorityFarry acknowledged the differences among the parties from Northern Ireland who take their seats at Westminster but suggested that the DUP, the SDLP and Alliance could work together in response to Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.“Together we have a reasonable argument and we speak with a moral authority about trying to mitigate the impact of that boundary down the Irish Sea. At the very least, we would ask that the prime minister and government meet us halfway in that regard,” he said.Maiden speeches in the House of Commons are by convention heard in silence and without interruption, something the SDLP’s Claire Hanna noted as she began hers.“I anticipated having a wee bit more time to craft my maiden speech and to reflect our outlook. But, put simply, Brexit is an emergency and I was elected to do all I can to mitigate the impact of Brexit for the people I represent. Also, as a Northern Irish politician and a mum of three, the opportunity to speak for five minutes uninterrupted was too exciting,” she said.The DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson urged the prime minister to find a way to ensure that trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK could be “unfettered”, as the withdrawal agreement promises, despite different regulatory and customs arrangements.“We would like to be able to support what is happening, but we have grave concerns about the potential impact on the Northern Ireland, where economic prosperity goes hand in hand with political stability. The peace process cannot just be about the politics of Northern Ireland it has to be about prosperity for Northern Ireland as well,” he said.Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

For once I am not lambasting politicians for this.Because I can’t blame them for the ide which I believe causes damaging pain, the gulf between generations. The fact is even the oldest and the youngest need each other.Documentaries by Channel 4 celebrating the success of nursery schools located in old people’s care homes underscore the point.The old need the young to keep us fit, strong and happy. The young need the old to tell them our stories and stop them stumbling into the same old landmines. And yet everything about our current society, where we live, how we shop, how we entertain ourselves, sets up barriers that keep us apart.Looking back to my own childhood, I see all of us grandchildren circling around my grandmother’s home. I visited her every weekend. When as an appalling teenager I ran away from home, it was to stay overnight with granny. But then we lived within a couple of miles of her.This Christmas I will be speaking, as I have for the past six years, to Silver Line callers, older people who are living alone, isolated from children, whose memories of happier years deepen their loneliness, but for whom Christmas is now, as one told me last year, “Just another day to get through.”Three years ago I helped to launch a project created in Torpoint by Elisabeth and David Carney-haworth, she a head teacher, he an ex-policeman. It’s called Silver Stories and like most brilliant ideas it’s so simple.Elisabeth asks six and seven year olds, year 2 of her primary school, (the “Silver Readers”), to telephone older people, (“Silver Listeners”), once a week in their lunch-time from their school, and read to them. Two of the Silver Readers, Holly aged 6 and Robert aged 7 rang me this week and read to me a poem about a rain forest.Holly told me she likes to read to older people “Because it’s a time when they can relax and have a cup of tea and a biscuit.” Robert added, “And because we can talk to them and make their day.”They agreed they both like talking to older people, as Robert explained, “Because I like reading, and it’s a nice way to say thank you to them.”When I revealed my age they responded with a satisfying “Wow”. I shocked them by revealing that when I was young there was no television, and I didn’t eat a banana until I was six. I explained it was due to the second world war, and they sang me the song they’ve been practising for their Remembrance service, “We’ll Meet Again.” The whole conversation was a delight.Doris, one of the Silver Listeners the children read to each Thursday, told me she used to teach in the school. Now aged 86 Doris lives in a care home near Manchester.She has osteo-arthritis which means she cannot stand or walk, and as almost everyone else in the home has dementia, she spends all her time sitting in her room, crocheting, doing puzzles and reading a great deal. Her husband died 14 years ago, “I miss him so much”. Her son lives in New Zealand, her daughter lives 150 miles away, she occasionally sees a child when a carer brings a toddler in, “I love it when they plonk them on my lap.” She misses the company of children, “I was with them for 24 years”, so for her Silver Stories are “A joy, I’m very grateful.”And she wrote her Silver Readers a poem to express her appreciation, “Dear children as you happily speak, I look forward to hearing you every week. Keep up the good work and all you do. Best wishes and a huge thank you.”So before Christmas this year, I would like to call upon every primary school to contact care homes in their area and ask for Silver Listeners. To be read to once a week is a pleasure. When you are deprived of children’s company, to be read to by 6 year olds is a special joy.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

And which ones are near you? Enter your postcode below to find out the undersubscribed, outstanding schools in your area.How to find out if schools in your area are oversubscribedEnter your postcode into our searchable tool above, and you will get a list of all the schools in your area.You can not only find out which schools in your area are over or undersubscribed, but also see their Ofsted ratings. You\u0027ll find out the best but also the most realistic school in your area to apply to, based on 2019\u0027s intake.The data, obtained from the Department for Education through freedom of information requests, compares the number of times a school was listed as a first-preference choice to the number of places offered in 2019. This presents the most up-to-date figure for the ratio of applications per place at any inidual school.Kensington and Chelsea has the most \u0027outstanding\u0027, undersubscribed secondary schoolsThe local authorities with the largest proportion of undersubscribed, outstanding secondary schools are Kensington and Chelsea, Merton, and Westminster.Three of Kensington and Chelsea\u0027s six secondaries are not only ranked as outstanding but they also had fewer first-preference applications than offered placed in 2019. These are Saint Thomas More Language College, Chelsea Academy and Kensington Aldridge Academy.This means that half of Kensington and Chelsea\u0027s secondary schools are both under-subscribed and outstanding, with similarly high proportions in Merton (33 per cent), Westminster (30 per cent) and Southwark (26 per cent).On the other hand, there were 91 constituencies that didn\u0027t have a single outstanding, under-subscribed school. These included from Blackpool, Derby, the Isle of Wight, Barking and Dagenham in London, Surrey and Wolverhampton. The most oversubscribed outstanding school in 2019 was The Royal School in Wolverhampton which had 7.94 first-preference applications for every place it offered.The outstanding school with the lowest ratio of applications per place was Notre Dame Roman Catholic Girls\u0027 School, in Southwark. In 2019, they saw 31 first-preference applications and yet handed out 123 places (a ratio of 0.25 applicants per place).One in ten local authorities do not have a single \u0027outstanding\u0027 schoolOne in ten local authorities do not have a single “outstanding” secondary school, an analysis by The  has found.There are 17 – including Brighton and Hove, Milton Keynes and South Gloucestershire – out of 151 local authorities in England, where not a single secondary has been given the top rating by Ofsted.Ministers are accused of putting “rocket boosters” under London’s schools while other parts of the county are left “fighting for resources” and falling behind.Anne Longfield, the Children’s Commissioner for England, said that youngsters in some parts of the country face a “double whammy of poverty and poor schools”.She said: “Every child should have the chance of going to an excellent school, yet too many are leaving fifteen years of education without even the basic qualifications.  “London’s education system has had rocket-boosters under it for nearly two decades, while schools in some poorer parts of the country are fighting for resources and falling further behind.”She said the Government must put a “relentless focus” on areas that are missing out, including help with recruiting good teachers and extra tuition for children who are struggling to keep up.  The other areas with no outstanding schools are Barnsley, Blackpool, Bury, Central Bedfordshire, Hartlepool, the Isle of Wight, Knowsley, Middlesbrough, North Lincolnshire, North Tyneside, Northumberland, St Helens, Swindon and Wigan.    Professor Sophie von Strumm, from York University’s department of education, said that regional variation in schools’ Ofsted rating is likely to be a reflection of differences in parents’ wealth.  “Rich parents move to areas with outstanding schools for their children,” she said.“However, attending an outstanding school doesn\u0027t make much of a difference for your school performance, it\u0027s your family background that matters.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “This government is determined that every child can benefit from a high-quality education, and teachers and school leaders are helping to drive up standards right across the country. They said that 85 per cent of children now in good or outstanding schools compared to just 66 per cent in 2010.When do you find out secondary school places?You find out about which school your child has been offered a place on March 1 for the following September. When is the secondary school application deadline?The application deadline is October 31 for children starting school the following September. Miniature horses prescribed on the NHS to help patients recover Boris Johnson insists there will be \u0026#39no alignment\u0026#39 with the EU after Brexit Comment: The real challenge to this Government lies in standing up to unelected powerPrimary schools should team up with care homes so children and elderly can read to each otherWe live in a ided nation. The oldest and the youngest need each otherBillionaire John Caudwell gave £500,000 to Tories three days after BBC Radio clash with John McDonnellPhones4U founder John Caudwell: Why I gave £500,000 to the Conservatives three days after meeting John McDonnellBroadcasters must adapt if they want to survive         Six killed as India endures bloodiest day of protests since \u0026#39anti-Muslim\u0026#39 citizenship law implementedBehind the \u0026#39red wall\u0026#39: why the north believes in Boris Johnson to deliverSmoking to be banned on all hospital grounds from next April Angling officials investigate Britain\u0026#39s biggest sea trout amid claims it could be salmon hybridComment: Sausage lovers can rest easy with a quality British banger on their plateProminent US Evangelical magazine calls for Donald Trump to be removed from officeSajid Javid orders Royal Mint to strike millions of new Brexit 50p coins for third time of askingBoeing\u0026#39s Starliner astronaut capsule forced to cut short test flight after malfunction Poland on course for clash with the EU over new legislation \u0026#39gagging\u0026#39 judgesBrexit vote latest news: Stop calling each other Leavers or Remainers, Boris Johnson says, as Brexit Bill overwhelmingly passedComment: Britain is teaching the world a lesson in stability and good governanceProstate cancer checks could prevent one in six deaths from the disease We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/01/16/rexfeatures-5886234f.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6943936  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 11.

Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002)The prequel trilogy has lived on in infamy, but the true low point of this low point in the Star Wars franchise must be Attack of the Clones, the dry, crusted middle of the cinematic sandwich. While Revenge of the Sith has some sense of completion and The Phantom Menace has some sense of wonder, all Attack of the Clones has is a CGI Yoda bopping about the screen like an unswattable fly while battling Christopher Lee’s Count Dooku. It’s a film driven by unnecessary desires: from the space politics, to Boba Fett’s backstory, to Padmé and Anakin’s romance. The latter is the most insufferable, since George Lucas never had much of an ear for dialogue, as notoriously pointed out by Harrison Ford when he declared on set: “George, you can type this s***, but you sure as hell can’t say it.” Which leads us to one of the worst line readings in cinematic history, when Hayden Christensen’s Anakin laments: “I don\u0027t like sand. It\u0027s coarse and rough and irritating – and it gets everywhere.”211 10. Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005)Hollywood has increasingly made the assumption that “darker” means better when it comes to cinema – it explains why the Harry Potter films look like they were made while someone gradually turned down the dimmer switch on the studio lights. Of course, audiences know that “darker” sometimes means that your protagonist-turned-villain becomes a “youngling”-murdering, amateur street magician-looking sourpuss. Anakin’s arc here comes to a whimper of an ending, underlined by the much-derided decision to have Darth Vader’s first moments onscreen involve him howling “Noooooo!” up to the sky like a mournful hound. That said, Ewan McGregor confirms here that he managed to escape the franchise largely unscathed, as this instalment sees him have the most fun with the clunky dialogue (see: “Hello there!” and “I have the high ground!”).311 9. Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999)The Phantom Menace escapes slightly ahead of the rest of the prequel trilogy, if only for the fact it remembers these films are meant to be fun once in a while. The pod race – it’s a good scene! Darth Maul is all looks, zero follow through – it’s embarrassing to act like you’ve won, only to be cut in half and sent hurtling down an exhaust pipe – but his inclusion in the film did introduce one of the best musical themes in Star Wars history, John Williams’s “Duel of the Fates”. However, the space politics are a particular drag here, with all the talk of trade disputes, and, of course, it\u0027s obligatory to mention the terror that is Jar Jar Binks.Although it’s the weakest of the new generation of Star Wars films, Solo still holds up as a fun romp worthy of Han Solo’s rascal reputation. Alden Ehrenreich picks up on enough of Harrison Ford’s mannerisms to sell the character without sliding into imitation, while Donald Glover is a scene stealer from the very moment he walks on screen as Lando Calrissian. It’s a lost opportunity, then, that the film is otherwise slowed down by an impulse to offer backstory to as many aspects of Han’s character as possible. Did we really need to know how we got the name “Solo”? Really?511 7. Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of SkywalkerDirector JJ Abrams, like the hero of an ancient prophecy, was destined to make both enemies and allies with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. There will be arguments. And there will be arguments about the arguments. There will be obsessive deconstructions and over-interpretations of each frame and intake of breath. But, at the end of the day, this is still a Star Wars film in its very bones, muscle, and sinew. Whatever controversy Abrams might have brewed up with his artistic choices, he still captures magnificently the soul of this series: that unwavering hope that the powerless can win, despite the odds. 611 6. Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) There’s a lot to wrap up in the concluding chapter of the original trilogy. The result is a few odd turns for the sake of plot convenience. What does one do with a character as enigmatic as Boba Fett? Why, have him topple into the Sarlacc pit within the first 20 minutes! How does one put to rest the love triangle hinted at in A New Hope? Why, insert a revelation that Luke and Leia are, in fact, brother and sister! Even the second Death Star oddly feels sillier than The Force Awakens and its third attempt at a giant ball in space, since The First Order at least had the excuse that their obsessive admiration of the Empire may have clouded their judgement. That said, there’s still plenty of charm to be found here and the Ewoks aren’t all that bad. Before you dismiss them as irritating merchandise opportunities, it’s worth remembering that they have absolutely no qualms about killing and eating people.If Rogue One is any indication of Disney’s plans for the franchise and its future, then there’s no cause for concern. The first of the “A Star Wars Story” spin-offs, it shifts into gear with ease, soothing audiences by not straying too far from the familiar timeline while introducing a full set of new characters and a grittier tone. Stylistically, it feels more like a Vietnam War movie and is proof of how far a gifted director like Gareth Edwards can stray from the franchise’s usual formula and still feel grounded in the same world. Plus, you have to admire the guts it takes to deliver an ending like that…Disney made a very smart move with The Force Awakens. As the first Star Wars film of a new generation, it not only had to make its own mark, but feel familiar enough that it welcomed fans back with open arms. The balance is hit perfectly here. That’s largely due to the film’s new trio of central heroes, who radiate the same kind of warmth, bravery, and spirit that carved a special place in people’s hearts when they were first introduced to the franchise’s original stars. Daisy Ridley’s Rey, John Boyega’s Finn, and Oscar Isaac’s Poe honour Star Wars\u0027s past while striding into its unknown future. It also helps that the film has landed on a villain like Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), whose drive and complexity may see him surpass even Darth Vader by the end of his story in Episode IX.Any isiveness the film attracted certainly proved one thing: here’s a Star Wars film that actually took a creative risk. And what a bold, ambitious, and ultimately beautiful risk that was. Director Rian Johnson took the cinematic legacy presented before him and added a new richness to its textures. He allowed heroism to go beyond the clean ide between good and evil through Luke and Rey, we were taught not to be ashamed of our doubts but to grow stronger because of them. We were taught not to use destiny as a crutch, but to know when to forge our own paths. The Last Jedi is a soulful film told through some of the most striking cinematography of the entire franchise.It’s the place where it all began. The Star Wars franchise has only become the success it is today because of how purely revolutionary the first instalment was as a piece of Hollywood filmmaking. It is, to this day, one of the most successful examples of the modern epic, endlessly imitated but so rarely with the same heart or ambition. George Lucas tapped into one of the most timeless qualities of storytelling: its ability to let us see and understand our own world through the eyes of another. Star Wars has become so iconic because, even on such a grand scale, we know and relate to the emotions at hand – fear, love, or a desire to do what’s right.The Empire Strikes Back is remarkable in its ability to pursue real emotional stakes. Its closing moments, the final note to its symphony of sacrifice and tragedy, leaves us with the single, delicate emotion that is hope, blooming in the darkness as our heroes set out to save Han and restore the Rebel Alliance. What A New Hope built up by making us fall in love with these characters, The Empire Strikes Back recouped in sharing with us their pain and their fears. Darth Vader’s reveal that he’s Luke’s father has, of course, found its place in history, but there’s an equal sense of emotional resonance in the moment Leia and Han depart, moments before he’s trapped in carbonite. When Leia’s “I love you” is returned by Han’s “I know” – a line written by Harrison Ford himself – we’re reminded of how magical Star Wars’s sense of storytelling can be, condensing everything that these two characters feel for each other into five simple words.111 11. Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002)The prequel trilogy has lived on in infamy, but the true low point of this low point in the Star Wars franchise must be Attack of the Clones, the dry, crusted middle of the cinematic sandwich. While Revenge of the Sith has some sense of completion and The Phantom Menace has some sense of wonder, all Attack of the Clones has is a CGI Yoda bopping about the screen like an unswattable fly while battling Christopher Lee’s Count Dooku. It’s a film driven by unnecessary desires: from the space politics, to Boba Fett’s backstory, to Padmé and Anakin’s romance. The latter is the most insufferable, since George Lucas never had much of an ear for dialogue, as notoriously pointed out by Harrison Ford when he declared on set: “George, you can type this s***, but you sure as hell can’t say it.” Which leads us to one of the worst line readings in cinematic history, when Hayden Christensen’s Anakin laments: “I don\u0027t like sand. It\u0027s coarse and rough and irritating – and it gets everywhere.”211 10. Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005)Hollywood has increasingly made the assumption that “darker” means better when it comes to cinema – it explains why the Harry Potter films look like they were made while someone gradually turned down the dimmer switch on the studio lights. Of course, audiences know that “darker” sometimes means that your protagonist-turned-villain becomes a “youngling”-murdering, amateur street magician-looking sourpuss. Anakin’s arc here comes to a whimper of an ending, underlined by the much-derided decision to have Darth Vader’s first moments onscreen involve him howling “Noooooo!” up to the sky like a mournful hound. That said, Ewan McGregor confirms here that he managed to escape the franchise largely unscathed, as this instalment sees him have the most fun with the clunky dialogue (see: “Hello there!” and “I have the high ground!”).311 9. Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999)The Phantom Menace escapes slightly ahead of the rest of the prequel trilogy, if only for the fact it remembers these films are meant to be fun once in a while. The pod race – it’s a good scene! Darth Maul is all looks, zero follow through – it’s embarrassing to act like you’ve won, only to be cut in half and sent hurtling down an exhaust pipe – but his inclusion in the film did introduce one of the best musical themes in Star Wars history, John Williams’s “Duel of the Fates”. However, the space politics are a particular drag here, with all the talk of trade disputes, and, of course, it\u0027s obligatory to mention the terror that is Jar Jar Binks.Although it’s the weakest of the new generation of Star Wars films, Solo still holds up as a fun romp worthy of Han Solo’s rascal reputation. Alden Ehrenreich picks up on enough of Harrison Ford’s mannerisms to sell the character without sliding into imitation, while Donald Glover is a scene stealer from the very moment he walks on screen as Lando Calrissian. It’s a lost opportunity, then, that the film is otherwise slowed down by an impulse to offer backstory to as many aspects of Han’s character as possible. Did we really need to know how we got the name “Solo”? Really?511 7. Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of SkywalkerDirector JJ Abrams, like the hero of an ancient prophecy, was destined to make both enemies and allies with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. There will be arguments. And there will be arguments about the arguments. There will be obsessive deconstructions and over-interpretations of each frame and intake of breath. But, at the end of the day, this is still a Star Wars film in its very bones, muscle, and sinew. Whatever controversy Abrams might have brewed up with his artistic choices, he still captures magnificently the soul of this series: that unwavering hope that the powerless can win, despite the odds. 611 6. Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) There’s a lot to wrap up in the concluding chapter of the original trilogy. The result is a few odd turns for the sake of plot convenience. What does one do with a character as enigmatic as Boba Fett? Why, have him topple into the Sarlacc pit within the first 20 minutes! How does one put to rest the love triangle hinted at in A New Hope? Why, insert a revelation that Luke and Leia are, in fact, brother and sister! Even the second Death Star oddly feels sillier than The Force Awakens and its third attempt at a giant ball in space, since The First Order at least had the excuse that their obsessive admiration of the Empire may have clouded their judgement. That said, there’s still plenty of charm to be found here and the Ewoks aren’t all that bad. Before you dismiss them as irritating merchandise opportunities, it’s worth remembering that they have absolutely no qualms about killing and eating people.If Rogue One is any indication of Disney’s plans for the franchise and its future, then there’s no cause for concern. The first of the “A Star Wars Story” spin-offs, it shifts into gear with ease, soothing audiences by not straying too far from the familiar timeline while introducing a full set of new characters and a grittier tone. Stylistically, it feels more like a Vietnam War movie and is proof of how far a gifted director like Gareth Edwards can stray from the franchise’s usual formula and still feel grounded in the same world. Plus, you have to admire the guts it takes to deliver an ending like that…Disney made a very smart move with The Force Awakens. As the first Star Wars film of a new generation, it not only had to make its own mark, but feel familiar enough that it welcomed fans back with open arms. The balance is hit perfectly here. That’s largely due to the film’s new trio of central heroes, who radiate the same kind of warmth, bravery, and spirit that carved a special place in people’s hearts when they were first introduced to the franchise’s original stars. Daisy Ridley’s Rey, John Boyega’s Finn, and Oscar Isaac’s Poe honour Star Wars\u0027s past while striding into its unknown future. It also helps that the film has landed on a villain like Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), whose drive and complexity may see him surpass even Darth Vader by the end of his story in Episode IX.Any isiveness the film attracted certainly proved one thing: here’s a Star Wars film that actually took a creative risk. And what a bold, ambitious, and ultimately beautiful risk that was. Director Rian Johnson took the cinematic legacy presented before him and added a new richness to its textures. He allowed heroism to go beyond the clean ide between good and evil through Luke and Rey, we were taught not to be ashamed of our doubts but to grow stronger because of them. We were taught not to use destiny as a crutch, but to know when to forge our own paths. The Last Jedi is a soulful film told through some of the most striking cinematography of the entire franchise.It’s the place where it all began. The Star Wars franchise has only become the success it is today because of how purely revolutionary the first instalment was as a piece of Hollywood filmmaking. It is, to this day, one of the most successful examples of the modern epic, endlessly imitated but so rarely with the same heart or ambition. George Lucas tapped into one of the most timeless qualities of storytelling: its ability to let us see and understand our own world through the eyes of another. Star Wars has become so iconic because, even on such a grand scale, we know and relate to the emotions at hand – fear, love, or a desire to do what’s right.The Empire Strikes Back is remarkable in its ability to pursue real emotional stakes. Its closing moments, the final note to its symphony of sacrifice and tragedy, leaves us with the single, delicate emotion that is hope, blooming in the darkness as our heroes set out to save Han and restore the Rebel Alliance. What A New Hope built up by making us fall in love with these characters, The Empire Strikes Back recouped in sharing with us their pain and their fears. Darth Vader’s reveal that he’s Luke’s father has, of course, found its place in history, but there’s an equal sense of emotional resonance in the moment Leia and Han depart, moments before he’s trapped in carbonite. When Leia’s “I love you” is returned by Han’s “I know” – a line written by Harrison Ford himself – we’re reminded of how magical Star Wars’s sense of storytelling can be, condensing everything that these two characters feel for each other into five simple words.This means that the dolls have become the best-selling plush figure toys through pre-orders only, and won’t be actually available for another five months.Amazon keeps separate categories for other types of plush toys, such as interactive items, plush pillows and plush puppets.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was agreed that cod quotas will be cut by 50 per cent in the North Sea, while limited quotas were agreed for cod in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and west of Scotland – just enough to allow the landing of accidental catch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Scottish White Fish Producers\u0026nbspAssociation (SWFPA) said the cod quotas would make conditions “extremely challenging” for people in the industry.However, there were increases for other species, with quotas for haddock in the North Sea rising by 23 per cent and sole in the western Channel rising by 19 per cent.Created

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an independent coastal state, we will no longer be shackled by the hated Common Fisheries Policy.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is still not clear whether it was the result of a genuine fallout or a more friendly jibe.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s Twitter account is hardly used at all, despite having more than 400,000 followers. While he used it throughout 2009 to write about new\u0026nbsp features, the only post since was a 2012 message that linked out to a post on his official Facebook page.Mark Zuckerberg followed one new person on Twitter this yearMr Zuckerberg followed only one user of the site through the whole year – in another unexplained, unusual interaction. But that happened at the beginning of the year and is not thought to be related to any of the new events.\u0026nbspSome have speculated that the goat – and perhaps all of the events – are in reference to a strange exchange between the two billionaires at the beginning of the year.In January, Mr Dorsey claimed that Mr Zuckerberg had served one of the animals as part of a meal, during a year when he was only eating food he had killed.Mr Dorsey said that Zuckerberg is a “very, very smart businessman,” and then he went on to say: “He made goat for me for dinner. He killed the goat.”The Twitter boss then clarified that Mr Zuckerberg did not kill the goat in front of him but “killed it before” their meal.“I guess he kills it,” he said. “He kills it with a laser gun and then the knife. Then they send it to the butcher.”Mr Dorsey\u0026nbspthen corrected himself to make clear it was probably a stun gun, and went on to suggest that he did not eat the goat because it was cold.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

APTaking Harry Belafonte’s 1956 hit “Mary’s Boy Child” and singing it in medley with new song “Oh My Lord”, Boney M’s No 1 hit combined Christmas carol-like harmonies with Euro disco, steel drums and a reggae sensibility. It might sound disastrous – but somehow it works. AP“He’s gone2,000 milesIs very far,” sings Chrissie Hynde, above a twanging guitar riff in “2,000 Miles”, her serpentine melody stretching each syllable into several. You could easily assume it’s about two separated lovers, but it was actually written for the band’s original guitar player, James Honeyman-Scott, who died of a drug overdose a year earlier at the age of 25. The song is desperately bleak – as is the case with all the best Christmas songs – but with a note of festive hopefulness too. “The children were singingHe’ll be back at Christmas time.” AP418 15) Rockin\u0027 Around the Christmas Tree – Brenda LeeBrenda Lee was just 13 years old when she made herself a rockabilly legend thanks to the recording of this party classic. It always reminds me of scenes in The Santa Clause (one of the best ever Christmas films) where the jaunty number was heavily featured, along with seminal holiday movie Home Alone. RO518 14) Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow! – Dean MartinFew Christmas songs are as cosy as this one. Dean Martin’s smooth, rich voice is as warming as a good glass of whisky paired with sweeping, romantic strings and a chirpy flute, “Let it Snow!” conjures up images of stockings hanging up over the chimney, a Christmas tree glinting with baubles, and a frost-tinted window with snow falling outside. RO618 13) Walking in the Air – The Snowman  Peter AutyThough Aled Jones tends to get the credit for this haunting masterpiece, it is actually the voice of choirboy Peter Auty that appears in the climactic scene of the wordless 1982 animation The Snowman. He wasn’t credited though, and when his voice broke and Jones’s version reached number five in the UK charts, he was almost written out of history. In truth, though, whichever version you hear, the song’s sweeping grandeur is goosebumps-inducing. AP718 12) Peace on Earth Little Drummer Boy – David Bowie Bing CrosbyRecorded for Bing Crosby’s TV special Merrie Olde Christmas, and framed around a strange scripted exchange of banter between the two, this mash-up only came about because Bowie hated the song, “Little Drummer Boy”, that he had been asked on the show to sing. So songwriters Ian Fraser and Larry Grossman, alongside the show’s scriptwriter, cobbled together “Peace on Earth” to serve as a counterpoint, while Crosby performed the intended song. They recorded the resulting medley after less than an hour of rehearsal, and five weeks later, Crosby died. AP“Eartha Kitt is the sexiest woman in the world. You don’t write Christmas songs that are sexy. How are we going to do that?”This Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1018 9) I Believe in Father Christmas – Greg LakeThis Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1118 8) It\u0027s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year – Andy WilliamsAndy Williams’ classic brings to mind the kind of big, brash Christmas’s you see in American films – lots of presents, blazing fireplaces and a huge feast – but also plays heavily on the importance of spending time with your loved ones. It consistently appears in the top 10s of Christmas song rankings, and more than 50 years in, the 1963 staple shows no signs of wearing out. RO1218 7) \u0027Stop the Cavalry – Jona LewieIt was “just another anti-war song” until Jona Lewie threw a kazoo into the mix. The English singer-songwriter never intended “Stop the Cavalry” to become a Christmas single, but the festive mention in the line “I wish I was at home for Christmas”, along with the addition of a Salvation Army brass band and tubular bell, was enough to convince listeners.1318 6) Driving Home for Christmas – Chris ReaIn 1978, Rea thought it was all over. His record contract was done, and his manager had just told him he was quitting. Rea wanted to get home from London’s Abbey Road studios to Middlesborough, but his record company wouldn’t pay for a ticket.Sinatra’s version of this classic Christmas song opens on his isolated vocals before gradually introducing the swooning choir and tender strings section. And the lyrics: “Have yourself a merry little ChristmasMake the Yuletide gay  From now on your troubles will be miles awayHere we are as in olden daysHappy golden days of yoreFaithful friends who are dear to us  Gather near to us once more.” RO1518 4) All I Want for Christmas is You – Mariah CareyGeorge Michael wrote, performed, produced and played every single instrument on this song, where the narrator looks back with sadness on a past relationship. As with “Fairytale of New York”, you have an upbeat, cheerful rhythm and chirpy instrumentation, against the melancholy of unrequited love in the lyrics, with the suggestion that it was given away too hastily (“This year, to save me from tearsI’ll give it to someone special”). RO1718 2) Fairytale of New York – The PoguesSome of the best songs combine uplifting instrumentation that contrasts with lyrics that can be downright miserable, and such is the case for “Fairytale of New York”. It has none of the sickly sweet sentimentality of Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” or Wham!’s “Last Christmas”.Richard (Dick) Smith was suffering from tuberculosis, an illness which had plagued him since a child, from his bed in a sanatorium in Philadelphia. Gazing longingly out of his window at the snow, he wrote a poem describing all the things he would do when he was well again. He was inspired by the views of people playing in the park across the street from his family home on Church Street, where he’d lived with his mother, brother and two sisters. His father had died when he was a child. 118 18) Happy Xmas (War is Over) – John Lennon and Yoko OnoThere’s a caveat to the optimistic message of the song’s title. “War is over,” sing a choir of children over festive tambourines, but only, they add, “If you want it.” Having analysed the success of his previous single, “Imagine,” the former Beatle noted, “Now I understand what you have to do: Put your political message across with a little honey.” On this, an anti-Vietnam war protest song wrapped up in sleigh bells, strings and an anthemic melody, he does just that.

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an independent coastal state, we will no longer be shackled by the hated Common Fisheries Policy.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Officials said they still had no idea what the recorded object was. Weather phenomenon, manmade craft and birds have all been ruled out.Created with Sketch.Revealed: eerie UFO sightings recorded in MoD files Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Speaking to the New York Magazine,\u0026nbspMr Underwood said: “The thing that stood out to me the most was how erratic it was behaving. And what I mean by erratic is that its changes in altitude, air speed, and aspect were just unlike things that I’ve ever encountered before flying against other air targets.“It was just behaving in ways that aren’t physically normal. That’s what caught my eye. Because, aircraft, whether they’re manned or unmanned, still have to obey the laws of physics. They have to have some source of lift, some source of propulsion. The tic tac was not doing that.”And he added: “You’re up there flying, like, ‘Okay. It’s not behaving in a manner that’s predictable or is normal by how flying objects physically move’.”Videos of UFOs spotted by military pilots are real, US Navy saysThe sighting came during a fortnight in which the USS Princeton had noted unknown aircraft intermittently passing across its radar systems off the US west coast. The contact was considered so inexplicable that the system was shut down and restarted to check for bugs — but operators continued to track the mysterious object afterwards.Then on 14 November, Commander David Fravor was flying a mission off the USS Nimitz when he eyeballed the object. It seemed, he later said, to e below the water, resurface, and speed out of sight when he approached.As Fravor landed, he told Underwood – just preparing to take off on his own mission – to be aware of unusual activity.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“Dave Fravor was like, ‘Hey, dude. BOLO,’ like, be on the lookout for just something weird,” Underwood said in his interview published on Thursday. “So, we go out to where our designated training area is. We’re not necessarily looking for something, but the Princeton had a specific object that they wanted us to hunt, for lack of a better word. And all of a sudden, I got this blip on my radar.”He said he did not see the object with his own eyes because he was focused on capturing video footage for intelligence to analyse later.Unusually, he was never fully debriefed on his sighting but had to take a phone call about the incident so soon after landing, he was still in his flight gear at the time.In the 15 years since, he said he has not speculated on what it might have been and had not previously given interviews because he did not want his name “attached to the ‘little green men’ crazies that are out there.”He added: “I do not want to be part of that community. It is just what we call a UFO. I couldn’t identify it. It was flying. And it was an object. It’s as simple as that. I’ll let the nerds, like, do the math on what it was likely to be. I just happened to be the person that brought back the video.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They have these massive eyes, bunched up noses… The condition is called brachycephalism.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He then tweeted a screenshot of the pug looking “nonplussed” after going viral online.Pugs in particular have exploded in popularity in recent years.

So, regardless of what I feel … it’s not going to be heard because we don’t have a vote.”The capital’s lack of representation is a conundrum for many of the Americans who call it home. While DC has voted to become a state, it lacks a senator and only has delegates with limited voting privileges.\u0026nbspIt would take a constitutional amendment in order for Washington to become a state — a lengthy process that typically requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Otherwise, two-thirds of the nation’s state legislatures would have to call for a constitutional convention.\u0026nbspDespite its lack of representation, DC — a erse district and the first city to have a black majority, despite losing that title in recent years — consistently votes overwhelmingly Democrat. With a Republican majority controlling the Senate, there is slim chance of it becoming a state anytime soon.\u0026nbspOn the bright side, Washington residents can vote for president the district has three electoral votes in the presidential election and turnout has risen in recent election cycles.Unfortunately for Williams, she says she doesn’t see a strong candidate on the 2020 campaign trail who she wants to support.\u0026nbsp“Quite honestly, I’m not impressed by any of them inidually,” she says. “If we could take some of them and make one person, I think that would be very helpful.”When asked which candidates she’d group together to create a fictional superhero-like\u0026nbsppresidential nominee, Williams names Julian Castro, Kamala Harris — who has since dropped out of the race — Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang.\u0026nbspSeparately, Williams can’t help but notice some obvious weaknesses in each of them.\u0026nbsp“Elizabeth Warren has a lot of lofty ideas about how she’s going to exclude corporate dollars, but you’re not going to be able to do that if you want to win. So, she’s going to have to make concessions there,” she says.She adds: “Andrew Yang…he’s just fresh, he’s thinking differently … and then Julian Castro has the benefit of being inside Washington as a Cabinet member. Is there something familial about him that I can connect with? Definitely.Williams says the top issues she’s focusing on in 2020 are education and healthcare, which she believes “go hand in hand.”\u0026nbspShe wants to see major reforms that totally revamp both systems and create long-term solutions to some of the biggest problems the country is facing.\u0026nbsp“If we improved our education across the board … that would contribute to being knowledgeable about some of the health factors out\u0026nbspthere to avoid or fix early on, mental health included,” she says.\u0026nbsp“Healthcare and education are very important to me, but I also see the state of the world and how we contributed to it. My first concern is: can we just get this man out?”I ask if Williams is referring to Donald Trump. She immediately interjects: “He’s horrible. I mean, there’s nothing redeeming about him. The longer he is in his seat as president, the more we see that he has absolutely no regard for the constitution, which is supposed to be our bible, so to speak.”Williams says she’s going to vote for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee after the primary process.\u0026nbsp“After he’s removed from office — my mouth to God’s ear — I’ll see what they’re going to do in terms of everything else,” she adds.I notice Williams doesn’t ever say the name of the president out loud, even while referring to him often.“With the incumbent, he doesn’t fight or attack on the real issues, so basically it’s name-calling, and we’re 13-year-olds in eighth grade again, so i will completely disregard him about his comments on any of the candidates, she continues.\u0026nbspIt’s very immature, very infantile, it’s like: shut up already!”I ask her if she isn’t mentioning the president’s name on purpose.“Yes,” she responds. “I try to avoid it, but I just feel like every other president in my lifetime brought a certain level of dignity and respect to the office. … I always thought they respected the office of the president. So I\u0026nbspwon\u0027t be disrespectful or call him out by his name … he’s just the incumbent — for now.”\u0026nbspPolarized is a weekly series featuring Americans from all 50 states sharing their views on the 2020 elections.

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity.

Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.There are 258 million children and young people around the world with no access to education\u0026nbsp– 59 million at the primary level alone, according to Unesco’s Institute for Statistics.Today, poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education programmes. No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will. He is one of the estimated 1.895 million children out-of-school children\u0026nbspin Tanzania today.New hope for Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge’s brutal war on educationHis only possible salvation may come through partnerships such as those between the Education Above All\u0026nbspFoundation (EAA) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT). These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So instead he’s issued an inadequate non-apology, claiming responsibility for his “share” of the defeat.His share ! His disastrous leadership was cited as the most popular reason for not voting Labour, followed by HIS nonsensical Brexit policy, then HIS barmy plans for the economy.He and his crackpot advisers are entirely to blame for Labour’s worst electoral performance in  years.Sadly for millions of decent Labour voters, that’s not how Corbynistas see it.As Emily Thornberry has apparently made clear, in their eyes the electorate was too uneducated and bigoted to grasp the wonders of “real change”.Well, we’ve got news for the Marxist clowns.It doesn’t take a fancy degree from a top university to know an IRA-supporting, Britain-hating anti-Semite when you see one.Or to understand that a politician who promises endless freebies is clueless about economics.Corbyn and his comrades have proved that they simply don’t get this country.They must quietly slip into obscurity.THE SUN is delighted that Boris Johnson plans to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee.When we all depended on the Beeb for entertainment, forcing viewers to cough up was just about defensible.But in , when many Brits are getting their dramas from Netflix and their sport from Sky, it emphatically is not.It’s downright shocking that good citizens from poor households are getting criminal records for such a trivial non-offence. And ludicrous that courts are wasting precious time prosecuting them.The pompous and patronising BBC is losing relevance by the day.A system that locks up those who don’t pump their hard-earned cash into its bloated coffers is clearly broken.BORIS Johnson has hit the nail on the head: rotten Whitehall is ripe for reform.In almost any other line of work,you do a bad job, you’re out on your ear.But because it’s practically impossible to sack civil servants, hundreds of sub-par paper-pushers are retiring with a £,-a-year pension — an eye-popping  per cent higher than the national average.The four core values of the civil service are honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity — all noble principles that have been unceremoniously cast aside by the scaremongering Remoaners currently roaming Whitehall.The Prime Minister’s bold plan to give them the chop is an excellent sign that this Government means business. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last week, nearly eight in ten backed Boris Johnson. Just  per cent of Workington Men voted for Jeremy Corbyn, and nine in ten believed Boris would make a better Prime Minister.In backing Boris and Brexit, these voters have made the Conservative Party far more representative of working Britain. More than a third of Conservative voters are now manual or skilled workers, and more than two thirds did not go to university.Geographically, the Tories now hold three times as many seats in the North East as they did historically, as well as three quarters of constituencies in the West Midlands, up from just one in four in . So much for the party of the South, the rich and the privileged.But this new electoral coalition will demand a new kind of politics. The common ground of public opinion is now marginally to the left on the economy and right on culture.By a ratio of two to one, voters want a society focused on giving people more security rather than freedom, and investment in public services rather than income tax cuts.If Boris wants to keep Workington Man blue he must break free of the traditional conservative economic playbook of trickle-down growth and bring purpose back to towns in the North and Midlands.It is telling that the walls of Workington train station are adorned with posters of the local British Steel factory that closed in , after  years of continuous production. This is a town proud of its history.The Conservatives must help Workington identy its economic future.New infrastructure, including better roads, reliable trains and faster broadband, will help. But on their own they will not be enough. For towns such as these to flourish, they need skilled jobs, dynamic companies and lasting private-sector investment.Margaret Thatcher bent over backwards to bring Nissan to Sunderland, revitalising the region and jump-starting a lagging national industry.Boris Johnson should do the same, using science, research  development and skills spending to tempt world-class companies in emerging sectors such as renewable energy and advanced manufacturing to cluster in his party’s new heartlands.High-skill jobs need skilled workers to do them — making a retraining revolution essential.More than a third of Workington Man voters have an apprenticeship and another third are educated to GCSE level. They are highly vulnerable to automation and globalisation.The Conservative manesto included £million a year to retrain disadvantaged people, but Onward’s analysis suggests more than £billion is needed each year to retrain Britain’s .million low-skilled workers before automation hits.The Tories must also reflect on the social fabric of the places it now represents.In many regional towns, the high street is emptying, libraries, pubs and social clubs are closing and crime is a rising concern.Places such as Wrexham, Blyth Valley and Bishop Auckland, all of which voted Conservative for the first time last week, are not in the lowest ranks of deprivation but they are united by a shared loss of belonging. The Conservatives need an answer to this fraying public realm.There is a limit to how much Whitehall can ever repair a sense of community itself, so a good start would be putting people and places back in control.The success of city mayors shows the value of local accountability for local services — as Boris Johnson, a former Mayor of London, knows well.Every place should be able to take the local leadership that the capital enjoyed during his tenure.Local groups should be given powers to take over shops, post offices and pubs when they close, with funding to match. More people should be encouraged to live and work near to where they grow up, rather than moving to the city to make their way.For too long, social success has been defined by how far you move from your parents.The realignment witnessed last week was profound, but it is not yet permanent.More than a fth of voters engaged in contract voting, lending their support to a party other than the one that represents their values — and contract voting was strongest in Leave seats and former Labour strongholds that fell to the Conservatives.Workington Man lent his vote. To make him vote blue again, the Tories need to deliver. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s what we lacked in the election”.The explosive remarks came in an exchange with a Labour colleague on Facebook messenger, which has been leaked to The Sun.Asked by the colleague why he wasn’t joining calls for Mr Corbyn to resign, Mr Russell-Moyle declared: “Because I’m not a c*** like those calling for his immediate resignation”.The firebrand MP added: “All the people saying stand down immediately are not saying it in good faith and that’s reason enough to ignore.“Anyonesays that they knew exactly what was wrong I’m afraid is a liar and a charlatan, and I will take no lessons from people who have spent the time undermining the party in all sorts of manners ofthe last few years”.In the conversation, Mr Russell-Moyle also stuck the kne into moderate Labour MP and potential leadership contender Jess Phillips, a long-standing Corbyn critic.Referring also to veteran Labour MP John Spellar, he added: “Jess Phillips would be a disaster. I think she would be truly terrible. I would have anyone but Jess. Well, maybe not anyone – Spellerwould be worse”.When contacted by The Sun last night about his attack on other Labour MPs and the use of his language, Mr Russell-Moyle said: “I said that because calling for Jeremy to go now is a silly and I would go so far to say c***ish thing to say.The best thing is for Jeremy Corbyn is to move aside in an orderly and organised fashion.“In private communications, it is an acceptable word to use, in public though it wouldn’t be.”He also accused the person who leaked the messages to be a suspended member of the party.Mr Russell-Moyle added: “People were speaking with knee jerk reactions the day after the election. We were hurting”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s moreyou’re working. But just tell them you’re unemployed or a student. They won’t check. Most of their current members are one or the other.And look who you have to choose from! Such a rich tapestry of political brilliance.David Lammy! Yay! The man who hates the police stop and search policy. A man who will brand you a racist before you’ve even opened your mouth.Richard Burgon! A plank of wood into which a village idiot has drilled two eyes and a mouth. Rebecca Long-Bailey — so inept even her own party members refer to her as Rebecca Wrong Daily.We could even co-ordinate and demand that they keep Magic Grandpa as boss. I mean, the party still seems to be in a state of denial. It was nothing to do with Corbyn! The voters loved him and loved our policies! We only didn’t win because of, er, Tory lies. The voters are thick, you see. Oh — and Brexit.For a very long time I was a member of the Labour Party. The main reason I left is the main reason nobody voted for it this time around. It is no longer the party of the poor and the working class.It has become a fringe group for metropolitan, middle-class liberals.Look at the only places it did well. Cambridge, Putney, Canterbury. Ha, bring on the revolution, then.“Are we manning the barricades, Cressida  Can I finish my Yakult first ”In a sense it doesn’t really matter who wins their leadership race. Labour lost not just because of the idiotic Corbyn or because of Brexit. It goes far deeper than that.It is the culture of the party. It despises everything its old voter base stands for. Even the moderates.It cannot abide patriotism, for a start. Its old voters are rather proud of Britain, and what Britain stands for. Corbyn and his allies hate our country.The traditional Labour voters believe in the traditional family, too. They have no time for identity politics and political correctness. They want a better deal, but don’t buy into all of the infantile agit-prop that goes along with today’s Labour Party.How the hell do you change that when the far-Left munchkins of Momentum still hold all the power There are still good people in the Labour Party. Some of them — like the brilliant Caroline Flint — lost their seats last week because of what Labour has become.Look at it now. Corbyn is STILL the leader. There is nothing they can do to get rid of him. He’s called for a period of reflection. It didn’t take the voters very long to reflect, did it We need a new party which represents working class people, especially away from London. That’s why I joined the Social Democratic Party.And we can happily leave the Labour Party to its “reflections”. Its support for terrorists, its loathing of the West. It STILL thinks it got its policies right.Even with a new leader it will still be terminally deluded.SO, is the BBC biased Welsh gob on a stick Huw Edwards thinks it is impeccably neutral. But then he would, wouldn’t he  But don’t take my word for it.Here’s the brilliant ex BBC journo and newsreader Michael Buerk, writing in the magazine The Critic. “ . . . all the presenters on the Today programme have been privately educated, like an astonishingly high proportion of the BBC’s editorial and production staff.”He added: “These are unormly bright, urban, young, well-educated arts graduates who have moved smoothly from one liberal institution to another. With little understanding of, or sympathy for, industry, business, the countryside or of course Brexiteers.”As Buerk pointed out, the BBC’s worldview is formed by the people who work for it.An estimated  per cent of them were against Brexit and there are plenty of objective studies which bear out a huge bias against Brexit.Go get ’em, BoJo.The advice is to always park where there are lots of people nearby .And in a well lit area. With the back of the car as close to a fence or kerb as possible.Anyway,someone sidles up to you in the pub and offers you a catalytic converter for a ton, here’s what to do.Kick him in the penkies and shove the converter as far up his rectum as is humanly possible.He’ll be passing incredibly clean wind, regardless of how many sprouts he eats.IS it possible to be more thick than Lauren Goodger  If so, how The Towie “star” got caught in a sting by the BBC. She was filmed endorsing a supposed health drink called Cyanora.She was told the product contained hydrogen cyanide, one of the most lethal substances known to mankind. But not known to Lauren, apparently.She was perfectly happy to give it her blessing. She admitted she’d never tried it . But then she also admitted she had never tried another product she had endorsed.Listen. Never believe TV personalities, actors, singers, etc.Don’t believe them when they tell you what way to vote. Don’t believe them when they’re trying to flog you something. For the most part they’re just greedy and thick as a plate of mince.OH what a pleasure it was to walk around a nice liberal, middle-class area of London last weekend singing: “Ohhhhhh Jeremy Corbyn!”The looks of hatred! I suppose it’s wrong to take pleasure in other people’s misery. But sometimes I can’t help it.

RUIs are what the Law Society’s head of justice has described as a “major scandal” waiting to erupt.I know Home Secretary Priti Patel will have a lot on her plate as Parliament begins, but this ought to be one of her top priorities.The shocking overuse of RUI came to light on Wednesday, after -year-old thug Ewan Ireland was jailed for le for the murder of solicitor Peter Duncan in a Newcastle shopping centre in August.Peter’s misfortune was to have brushed past Ireland in the doorway of a shop, an act which Ireland took as a slight.He took hold of the screwdriver he had stolen minutes earlier and drove it into Mr Duncan’s heart.It is a tale of mindless, casual violence which has become all too common in modern Britain as the jumped-up egos of young men rage against anyone who gets in their way.But what makes it all the more disturbing is that Ireland’s tendency for extreme violence was well known to police and the courts, yet still he was allowed to walk the streets.While other boys of his age are busy studying for A-levels, Ireland had already amassed a formidable range of criminal qualications.He had  convictions for  dferent offences. He was on conditional discharge for an offence of battery and on bail for a charge of affray for threatening to slash another boy’s Achilles’ tendon.Yet in spite of all this, he had been released under investigation for a robbery.He is not the only violent criminal to have been sent on his way by police. In September last year Alan Martin, of Sunderland, was released by police after his estranged we accused him of raping her.Not only did officers release him, they also ed to him the keys to his we’s house. He promptly ed to the address, attacked her with a hammer and strangled her before taking his own le, too.Astonishingly, Northumbria Police were later cleared by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. No one seems to want to take responsibility. No doubt it will be the same next time, too.Since April , , violent criminals have been released under investigation, Home Office figures reveal.Unlike police bail, no restrictions have been placed on these people. They are not banned from visiting particular places, they have not had to raise a deposit, hand over their passport or report to police at regular intervals. Nor, unlike police bail, is there any time limit on RUI, so police are under no pressure to bring charges quickly.The misuse of RUI is a hangover from Amber Rudd’s time as Home Secretary. It was her Policing and Crime Act  which stopped police putting people on bail for periods of more than  days. True, something needed to be done. The case of former Radio  DJ Paul Gambaccini had inspired the rule change.He had been held on bail for a whole year as police investigated accusations of historic sex offences which turned out to be without foundation.Unable to put criminals on bail for more than  days, police forces took to releasing them under investigation instead.That might be perfectly reasonable in the case of relatively minor crimes which take a long time to investigate, but it is hardly an appropriate way to treat suspected murderers and rapists, especially those with a long history of violent offences.At the very least, people suspected of violent offences — and for which good evidence exists that those offences really did take place — need to be monitored.As for people who have been released on licence while serving sentences for previous convictions, there should be no argument at all — they should be taken back to prison without hesitation.Ministers like to talk tough on crime, especially around election time, but behind the scenes they get caught in the stranglehold of the liberal establishment.Punishments get weakened, prisoners get released early.Disgracefully, former Home Secretary Jack Straw described the sentencing system as the “benign deception of the public”, who, unaware of the soft reality, assume that criminals are being properly punished.But there is nothing benign about serial offenders being freed to rape and murder when police and the courts know full well their records.During the election campaign, Boris Johnson finally called an end to the deception.Braving an onslaught from the nation’s liberal consciences, he announced that prisoners will no longer be eligible for automatic early release — something which allowed the London Bridge killer Usman Khan to embark on his murderous spree.But the Johnson Government should not end there.It needs to stop the police releasing violent offenders back into the community without any restrictions on their movements nor any requirement ever to report to a police station.Liberals like to say that we can’t solve crime just by jailing people. On the contrary, had Ewan Ireland been kept out of circulation after his first offence it would alone have meant  fewer crimes in Newcastle over the past four years.It is hard enough to catch criminals.But to release those we do catch, giving them the freedom to embark on long crime sprees, is plain madness.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it’s my great honour to mentor kids who have experienced the same. It’s called empathy. Look it up.Sanders then apologised, claiming she was unaware of Bidens condition.Stuttering and stammering are actually just the same thing, they refer to a relatively common speech problem in childhood which can persist into adulthood.A stammer can present itself in a few ways it can cause the person to repeat syllables, make words sound much longer or sometimes words can get stuck and not come out at all.It can y in its severity in dferent people, some who are barely affected at all while others can find the condition debilitating.It’s hard to say what causes children to start stammering but the NHS reassures parents that it won’t be caused by anything they have done.They explain that the development of speech is complicated and depends on many factors and that problems can occur when parts of this developing system aren’t quite coordinated.There are a number of dferent speech and language therapies for those who struggle with a stammer and each child would have their own tailor made treatment plan.These could include creating a more relaxed environment to build the child’s confidence and working on the feeling associated with stammering like fear and anxiety.“I actually didn’t know that about you and that is commendable,” she wrote. “I apologize and should have made my point respectfully.”In a recent interview with the Atlantic, Biden recalled his boyhood efforts to overcome his speech impediment.It doesn’t—can’t define who you are, Biden said to The Atlantic.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But for people dealing with grief, the festivities often bring a new wave of pain and heartbreak. TV producer Matthew Scott lost his mum Sharon  months ago and was dreading his first Christmas without her last year. He made excuses when friends asked him out for drinks, wiped the Christmas songs from his playlists and said the day itself just felt wrong. But this year things are going to be dferent. While the Scott family accept that Christmas will never be the same, they know how much their mum loved the festivities. So this year, theyaposre going to celebrate - because itaposs what she would have wanted. Here, Matthew explains what itaposs really like to deal with unimaginable grief at this time of year. --- Every year until last Christmas, a parcel would arrive for me on November th, A-sized and rather thin. The advent calendar, sent from mum without fail. But now I buy my own. A reminder of being without my mother aged . It’s been  months this December since mum passed away from secondary breast cancer. She was . For many, Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year. Music fills the air, it’s a time meant for joyous celebration with friends and family. But for me it’s also the season for intensied grief. And I’m not alone. Cruse Bereavement care saw a % increase in December helpline calls compared to  while , Samaritans volunteers responded to an average of  calls for help each from people feeling overwhelmed on th December. Mum loved Christmas. It was at Christmas that she excelled herself. She brought the family together. For the last few years of her le, I’d count down the days until I’d speed along the M from London back to rural Herefordshire, playing Chris Rea’s Driving Home for Christmas.  I’d arrive to boxes and boxes of chocolates that mum claimed were untouchable because they were “for Christmas Day”. And yet we were still eating them in January. Mum would get me up at the crack of dawn and shout “wakey wakey, it’s Christmaaaaas!. Even in our s, my sister and I would wait at the top of the stairs while mum would “checkSanta’s been” before we could come down. It wasn’t Christmas without her gravy with a secret spoonful of cranberry sauce for sweetness, stirred to the beat of Michael Bublé. She would dance around the kitchen, singing at the top of her voice while the dog would go mad. Mum was the most selfless woman. I remember we once met an old man in a café who lived alone. Mum got chatting and wanted to invite him round on Christmas day.  When she got her five-year all clear from cancer the first time around, she told me how she felt a new lease of le. How every flower seemed brighter, like she was living le in HD. Mum knew that le was precious. I was  when she passed in July last year. She got ill again very quickly and from her diagnosis to her death it was just six weeks.  My sister and I slept by her side in Cheltenham hospital every night during the final weeks. With things deteriorating rapidly, the three of us moved to a local hospice. From then on, time felt irrelevant. In a strange way, those last few days were the most therapeutic. It was just us, no distractions, no doctors reporting results every four hours. I remember singing to her in bed as she slowly smiled, eyes shut. The feeling of not wanting to waste a moment together tiptoes on the edge of never knowing when the final moment will come. But it did. I think about her death every day. Navigating the world since then has felt like I’m in a trance. I used to phone mum every day on my walk home from work. Sometimes we’d just stay on the phone together, not saying much. For a while I still called her number. At first, losing her felt like the end of my s. It aged me. Responsibility for my sister, my nan, and our dog Archie fell to me. I am estranged from my father, but mum and I were incredibly close. The paperwork that comes with someone passing is always overwhelming but aged , combined with losing someone who was my main support system, it was excruciating.  Just when you think you are coping well, a season or anniversary approaches and the memories take you right back to where you started. Last Christmas, the first one without my mum, my coping mechanism was to ignore the festive spirit. I made excuses to friends when asked to meet up for a mulled wine and Mariah Carey was removed from Spoty. On the day itself, my sister and I woke up in the family home and the rooms felt cold and empty. We laid a wreath on mum’s grave on Christmas morning and stopped quietly for a short while. We didn’t say much all day. Lunch was at my auntie’s but the atmosphere, the food and the exchanging of presents all felt wrong. It just wasn’t Christmas. But this year will be dferent. Mum loved Christmas and she would want us to fall back in love with it. So we will. We will get out her favourite baubles that she carefully bubble-wrapped, we will iron the Christmas tablecloth, white with embroidered holly leaves, and we will make her gravy.  My sister, a -year-old NHS nurse who cared for my mum devotedly, has to work on Christmas day so we’ll make merry a day late on Boxing Day. We’ve invited our nan and we’ll lay a place for mum and grandad, who we also lost months after mum. We can’t forget they aren’t here, so we will include them. I am by no means finished with grief. My mind runs wild with regret, missed opportunities, things I wish we’d done or said together. Grief is unfixable. It doesn’t heal.

Paul Brown deceived the women into believing they could be glamour or adult starsthey stripped off or joined him in casting couch sex sessions. He set up a bogus modelling agency which he pretended had nothing to do with him and which he actually controlled and used to manipulate the victims. The models thought the agency was genuine and could find them work but onlythey went for apostest shootsapos at his studio in Okehampton, where he operated under the  name of Paul D Smart. Brown invented two fictional women, who supposedly ran the Models South West agency. Brown, through the agency contacted many of the victims of Facebook, told them they had the potential to be models, and inviting them to the studio.  Once they were there, he persuaded some to have sex with him on camera and others to strip for what he called aposartistic nudeapos sessions where he in fact focussed his camera on their private parts. The rape victims were told they could earn large amounts by posing for a type of pornography called POV or point of view, in which the participants film themselves having sex. They all thought the material would be sent to the agency Model South West, which would find them work. In reality, the agency was a sham and Brown kept the images for his own sexual gratication. Some of the models who had sex with him were lured back to his studio on the Fatherford Farm trading estate in Okehampton by messages from the modelling agency saying the scenes had to be re-shot. One model who was reluctant to strip naked heard Brown call Model South West and pretend to have a conversation with the agency about how she was ideal for nude work. The models came from all over Devon and were of all ages and sizes, ranging from their late teens to their s, Many were vulnerable and insecure about their bodies and were fooled by Brownaposs smooth talking and flattery. None of them ever received any offers of work and none of them received any of the money which he promised would follow. Brown kept a record of his sexual conquests in a aposblack bookapos which recorded details of some of the rape victims. The book contained the names, ages, physical details of Brownaposs partners and included a mark out of ten for their performance. The book even included his own we, who scored nine out of ten. The whole set up with the agency was a device to con women into satisfying his sexual appetite, which was described as sleazy and sordid by the prosecution. Brown joked with police in one interview that he was not Harvey Weinstein but employed a classic casting couch technique of offering fame and fortune in exchange for sex. The couch actually came from Ikea. He set himself up as a photographer despite having little formal training and a background as an IT adviser, at one stage working for the NHS in Exeter. Brown committed the offences while running his studio at the Fatherford Farm trading estate in Okehampton between  and . The police were first alerted in  by one of the rape victims who went to a genuine modelling shoot with a professional photographer a few days afterwards.  She realised that what Brown had done amounted to a sexual assault and went to the police, who arrested him and seized the black book. He carried on in exactly the same way while he was being investigated by police and went on to rape another two women. Brown was found guilty of  out of  charges including  rapes against six dferent women. He was also found guilty of voyeurism against five other women. He pleaded guilty to one count of voyeurism, which involved him installing a hidden camera at his home to spy on a young female visitor in the bathroom. He was cleared of four counts of sexual assault, which alleged that he touched models while rubbing oil onto their bodies during shoots. Brown, aged , of Okehampton, denied a total of  rapes against seven women, four of sexual assault against four women, and six of voyeurism against six women. He said all the women consented to what he did, in many cases in advance and in writing. He was found guilty of  rapes and five counts of voyeurism and remanded in custody by Judge David Evans, who adjourned sentence until February. He put Brown on the sex offenders register and ordered the probation service to prepare a report of whether Brown is a dangerous offender. He told him:You have been convicted of many of these serious offences and in due course you will be sentenced to a signicant time in custody. The appropriate time will only be decided in the light of the relevant material.

His festive experiences ranged from the painfully tragic to the downright bizarre. Now the best-selling author of Diaries of a Junior Doctor has written a new book capturing the highs and lows of having to work while many of us are celebrating. In his first book Adam told how punishing long hours on the ward forced him to quit the vocation he cherished. These extracts from Twas The Nightsht Before Christmas, again based on his diaries, are equally funny, thoughtful and searingly honest. Here are some of his best bits The NHS front line sadly doesn’t get invited to Christ’s all-you-can-eat birthday shindig. For medical personnel the world over, Christmas is just another day. Employees vy up the shts and put in absurdly unsociable hours to ensure the rest of us make it through to the New Year in one piece. Of the seven Christmas Days I was a practising doctor, I ended up on the wards for six of them – removing babies and baubles from the ious places they found themselves stuck. Dec ,  Sharing what I think is a top-level anecdote in the doctors’ mess. I’m delighted with my story of the -year-old whose half-a***d attempt at a costume for his Christmas party landed him in AE. He had wrapped himself in layer upon layer of tinfoil, made a couple of holes for his eyes and one for his mouth, then dispatched himself to the party as a turkey. Hours later he collapsed, having desiccated himself to the human equivalent of a Ryvita and needed intravenous rehydration. Xmas Day  Santa might be putting his feet up but his pal the Grim Reaper never gets the day off. And so I find myself in a side room with a distressed family having The Chat about mum gran. Granny is outnumbered by E.coli bacteria in her bloodstream to the tune of several billion to one and there’s now only one way this can end. Hoping to show empathy through my body language, I lean in to say all we can do now is keep her comfortable and concentrate on her dignity. As I do so, I inadvertently lean on my tie. It’s a seasonal tie – a night-sky blue with old Santa on his sleigh perched right up near the knot. Moving down the tie we come to Prancer and Dancer and the rest of the reindeer massive with Rudolph proudly front and centre.  Crucially, and disastrously, underneath Rudolph’s red nose – and now the pressure of my elbow – is a button that activates a tinny speaker to blast out a frantic rendition of Jingle Bells. I turn ketchup red, apologise and jab at my abdomen. But all I succeed in doing is restarting the f***ing tune. Thinking of superlatives to add to my apologies, I notice one daughter laughing uncontrollably. Maybe there is an easier way to deliver bad news, after all. New Year’s Eve,  I meet Patient AW who prepared for the new year with a bang. Followed by a whimper. Finding herself in a suitor’s bedroom, in need of lubrication, she went to the kitchen and re­­­turned with a tub of peanut butter.  It wasn’t the most terrible choice – it’s oil-based, plus it offers the option of smooth or crunchy for added “pleasure”. Downsides include the fact that oil-based lubricants are kryptonite to condoms. Also, some people have peanut allergies. Patient AW, for example. But whyyyy ’ I asked, stret­ching the word longer than Annie Lennox ever managed.“I assumed it was only a problem, you know, up the other end,” she explained. Luckily, she escaped the worst-case scenario of breathing dficulties and ultimately not breathing at all. Xmas Day  Despite my best efforts it’s a hat-trick: three Christmases on the trot opening up patients instead of presents. I’m bleeped away to see Patient NW who has come to labour ward with reduced fetal movements at  weeks. And the baby’s breech – so caesarean section it is. “Oh, for f***’s sake,” she says.  I reassure her everything’s going to be absolutely fine. “Oh, it’s not that,” she groans. “My other one was born on Christ­­mas Day too. Everyone’s going to think I do this deliberately to save on presents.” Dec   And then there’s Patient KM, a lady in her s, about to kill herself with sharon fruits. A decade or so ago KM had a gastrectomy for stomach cancer and now has to keep to a strict diet, avoiding certain food types she can’t digest. Top of the list is the persimmon or sharon fruit – not exactly a Granny Smith so an easy fruit to avoid. You might think. Grow­ing up in Malta, KM’s family Christmas always involved eating sharon fruits and this isn’t a tradition she is prepared to let slide, despite her surgeon’s threats. She knew it wasn’t an idle threat either these little f***ers have caused five episodes of intestinal obstruction, ruining five Christmases. “It just wouldn’t be Christmas without it,” she tells me. I’m not sure whether she’s talking about the fruit or her hospital admission for intestinal obstruction. Dec   Medical emergencies don’t get any less frequent just because Slade is belting out of every shop’s PA system. Prof Devereux’s termination of pregnancy list is too time-sensitive for a week off. I’m rota’d into theatre with Prof today and first on the list is Patient SH whose unbelievably sad story is the stuff of ethics textbooks.  She’s  and has a cardiac condition that means she’s unlikely to liveshe continues with her pregnancy. At  weeks her hearthas already signicantly deteriorated and she’s had to make the heartbreaking decision to end the pregnancy to save her own le. Prof Devereux, chatting to the anaesthetist about who got treated the worst by the Christmas Rota Fairy, turns to me and asks: “Do you want to do it ” I really, really don’t. The procedure is going to be grim beyond words – one more trauma for me to push down into a box that’s already full to bursting. ButSH is brave enough to go through this then I should at least have the balls to step up for her. I wish I could say I was overreacting but the truth is that every single step of it was absolutely horrible. I’m jolted back into the here and now by Prof Dev­ereux. “Right, we’re done!” he bouncily announces. “Who’s the next customer ” I say: “I need to head back to the ward.” But I don’t. I need fresh air or a quiet room. Even a noisy room – any room that isn’t this one. Jan ,  “I don’t want to die,” Patient JM said, plaintively. None of us wants to die, of course – it’s human nature – but I was surprised to hear it from a -year-old.  We’re conditioned to describe this as a good innings. I decided the best thing was pretend I hadn’t heard and continued to insert the drip. She touched my hand. “Is this it ” she asked, her eyes searching mine. “Am I dying ” She knew. And she was dying – it wouldn’t be more than a day. I’d never been asked this before and I had no idea how to deal with it. I copped out and lied: “No, don’t be silly!” Not just “No” but “No, don’t be silly!” – negating her, throwing her off the scent, in reply to the bravest question of all. She pretended to accept my answer with a faint smile. I realise I never actually talk about death with patients. For the rest of the night sht I obsess over what I should have said. At the end of the sht I trudge back to her ward. I tell myself I’m going to speak to her again, giving myself a motivational pep talk as I go. You’ve got this, I say, you owe it to her. There’s an empty bed in bay three. I don’t have to. Xmas Eve  Patient HL presents with post-coital bleeding. Inside, everything looks a bit... grazed. There’s clearly a piece of her story missing. The actual answer is that, with no condoms available, she and her fella dipped into a selection box and improvised with a Mars bar wrapper – really embracing the “play” aspect of “work, rest and play”. I advise less abrasive methods of contraception and, until it has totally healed, to take a break. By which I don’t mean she should move on to KitKats.

Sentencing Noor, honorary recorder of Liverpool Judge Andrew Menary QC rejected the claim that the former performing arts student had set up a PayPal account in a fake name because of considerations of modesty. He said: I donapost accept simply that you are that modest or naive in the way you would like people to believe.  I have no doubt your commitment to your religion is entirely genuine but sadly there is a cunning about you which you maintained during your evidence. During the trial, the jury heard Noor, a former Miss Teen GB semi-finalist, and Webster messaged using the Telegram app and spoke about extremist groups including so-called Islamic State . They had access to video footage showing torture, beheadings and people being set on fire which the judge described as truly shocking. Noor, who wore a black hijab, also used the app to message a man named Hakim My Love who, she told the court, she had married over videolink and who described himself as an independent fighter in Syria.  On the day officers searched her house, in July , she had a ticket booked to travel to Turkey. The court was read emails found on a phone seized by police, believed to be written by Noor to Hakim, which said: Itaposs been my dream to marry a fighter for a long time and my dream to be a fighter myself even longer lol. The jury was told Noor had been in a relationship with a professional footballer when she was a teenager and also had a short marriage to a preacher. The player was not named, but Noor dated Sheyi Ojo who is currently on loan at Rangers.  David Gottlieb, defending, suggested her failed relationships may have led to the offences and sent her spinning out of the solar system. He said she was in a new relationship and her fiance was in court along with her brother and mother. Mr Gottlieb said: She needs to address issues of self-esteem and making relationships. Hossein Zahir, defending Webster, who wore a pink niqab, said she was on a path to reform. He added: The ideology she thought she believed in has left her le in ruins. He said she was influenced by Kamran Awan, who was connected to the Mercul Hands, and had been cynically used by him.

David Owen, lead emergency vet at Vets Nowaposs Manchester hospital, said: Shiny tinsel can be very attractive to both dogs and cats but, like anything stringy, itaposs extremely dangerousswallowed.  In veterinary medicine, we call this a linear foreign body.

Paul Harrison, , roped his we Samantha, , into the illegal enterprise, which they ran from their home, splashing out on a holiday, new car and personalised number plate. Suspicions were raised when a large batch of envelopes was rejected at a sorting office, with tests showing phosphor had been completely washed off the stamps. Investigators then raided the coupleaposs Barnsley home and found stamps being sorted and towels to dry them as well as related products all over the address.  Friend Graham Rought, a former dental technician from Birmingham, was also involved, carrying out the washing process from his garden shed. Ben Close, prosecuting at Birmingham Crown Court, said the offence involved obtaining and selling large quantities of stamps which had already been through the postage system. They bought second hand stamps, removed from envelopes, and sold them on so they could be reused. Paul Harrison accepts he put them on grease proof paper to make them appear asnew. Rought was involved in washing off the franking marks. The latter had been part of the scam for two and a half years with Harrison having operated an account called Affordable Stamps since June . Harrison, of Barnsley, purchased stamps in kiloware and sold them on Amazon and eBay, avoiding details being recorded on invoices in his dealings with others. He was locked up for four years after being convicted of adapting, supplying and possessing articles for fraud. He also admitted to money laundering and another charge of supplying articles for fraud.  His we, of the same address, was convicted of money laundering and sentenced to two years, suspended for two years. She was ordered to do  hours unpaid work. Rought, of Tile Cross, admitted adapting, supplying and possessing articles for fraud and money laundering. He was handed an  month sentence, suspended for  months, and ordered to do  hours unpaid work.  Mr Close said an investigation was launched after a large quantity of envelopes were rejected in Glasgow at on February , . They were largely addressed to schools in Scotland, and traced back to the Harrisons, with the process going on at their home when it was raided. The prosecutor said Harrison had contacted Rought on a number of occasions asking him about the method he used to wash the stamps.  There were some flirtatious exchanges between them because Rought thought he was speaking to Samantha Harrison, Mr Close said. The court heard Paul Harrison had been involved in the sale of around , stamps which had resulted in loss to Royal Mail of £,. Just over £, had gone into an account held by the Harrisons while Roughtaposs benefit had amounted to around £, and he had caused a loss to the Royal Mail of £,.  Paul Harrison had recruited his we into the scam, the court heard. In passing sentence Recorder Naomi Ellenbogen QC told Paul Harrison: It is clear to me this was a calculated business activity, the proceeds of which were your prime income. The fraud took place over a period of just short of nine years. You made considerable gain from these offences. James Bruce, for Rought, said he was arrested in August  and that the matter had been hanging over his head since that time.  He said it was not a sophisticated endeavour and that he had carried out the washing process in his garden shed. This was a one man band. He did not employ anyone , he added.

The -year-old will spend “a few days” on a private ward after being admitted as a precaution on a doctor’s advice because of an existing condition. But Palace aides dispelled any fears Philip suffered an ­emergency, insisting he did not need an ambulance to take him from Sandringham in Norfolk to King Edward VII Hospital, Central London, where he walked in “unaided”. Prince Philip was flown by helicopter from the Sandringham Estate to London. He was then driven to the hospital in Marylebone. The Queen went ahead with her plans to travel to the royal estate ahead of the Christmas holidays, where she will be joined by close family including son Prince Charles.  A statement from the Palace said: “The Duke of Edinburgh travelled from Norfolk this morning to the King Edward VII Hospital in London for observation and treatment in relation to a pre-existing condition. The admission is a precautionary measure, on the advice of His Royal Highness’ Doctor.” It is understood that the Duke was flown to hospital by helicopter from Sandringham to London and then driven to the hospital. Royal expert Ingrid Seward told how Philip and his -year-old we are used to spending time away from each other. The Majesty Magazine editor-in-chief said: “Philip has always been renowned for being as tough as an ox and ­incredibly active throughout his le. “It is no surprise the Queen has carried on with her Sandringham plans while he is in hospital. “Since the early days of their marriage when he was still serving in the Royal Navy they were used to spending large amounts of time apart and have always managed to be very independent of each other while remaining incredibly supporting of one another.”  The Queen caught the .am Great Northern service from King’s Cross station in London and arrived in King’s Lynn at .pm to begin the first day of her Christmas retreat. She is ­understood to have spoken to her husband before he was admitted and is being kept informed of how he is doing. Palace sources said it was unclear when the Duke would be discharged. The royals will be seen going to church on Christmas Day by locals who gather to catch a glimpse of them. Philip was last seen out in public at Balmoral in August. He has suffered a string of health scares in recent years.  In June , he was admitted to hospital with an infection. The Duke missed the State Opening of Parliament, with the Prince of Wales stepping in to ­accompany the Queen. Last year he was in for  days after a hip replacement. In , the duke had “an exploratory operation” on his abdomen. A year earlier, he missed the majority of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee ­celebrations after falling ill with a bladder ­infection. In , Philip spent Christmas in hospital after having a stent put in to clear a blocked ­coronary artery.

Ethical vegan Jordi Casamitjana only dates other vegans, doesnapost sit on leather sofas and doesnapost allow guests carrying animal products into his home. The campaigner is launching a landmark case in an attempt to get ethical veganism added to a list of protected characteristics enshrined in equalities law, in a bid to officially protect vegans from aposdiscriminationapos. The Mirror can today reveal his legal team plans to compare veganism to religious evangelism as one of its key arguments planned for the two-day employment tribunal pre-hearing on January . Mr Casmitjana plans to argue that the vegan movementaposs tendency to try to convert more people to the lestyle means it should be legally recognised as a aposphilosophy and belief systemapos. He will even produce receipts for vegan shoes and aftershave in court in his bid to argue that veganism is not just a diet- but a belief shared by a growing number of people in the UK. The trained zoologist is originally from Catalonia, but has lived in the UK for  years, and has had a long career in animal protection. He identies as an aposethical veganapos. Dietary vegans and ethical vegans both eat a plant-based diet, but ethical vegans also try to avoid any animal exploitation, such as by shunning clothing made of wool or leather and not using products tested on animals. Mr Casamitjanaaposs legal battle began last year after he was sacked from his job with the League Against Cruel Sports after disclosing to other employees that its pension funds invested in firms involved in animal testing. He claims he was sacked as a result of his ethical vegan beliefs. But the organisation has rejected his claims, previously telling the BBC he was dismissed for gross misconduct. The allegations will be dealt with separately in another employment tribunal hearing later next year. A spokesperson told the Mirror: “The League Against Cruel Sports is an inclusive employer and as this is a hearing to decide whether veganism should be a protected status, something which the League does not contest, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.”  Veganism aposlike a religionapos Vegan activists and legal eagles are closely watching the case, sayingMr Casamitjanaaposs wins it could set a signicant precedent.  But some commentators worryhe wins his case, it could open up the floodgates to other lestyles receiving legal protections that could have a aposchilling effectapos on free speech in the UKaposs workplaces. Mr Casamitjanaaposs key argument is that veganism should be treated as a belief because it reaches into every aspect of his le, and is a lestyle shared by a growing number of Brits. His legal team will present philosophical statements arguing that veganism is morally necessary. It will also all argue that the value he and other activists value place in persuading others to become vegan to increase followers of the lestyle cements its status as a belief system- not just a dietary or consumer choice. His side will also argue the world is becoming increasingly aware and accommodating of vegans.  Mr Casamitjana told the Mirror: “Currently many vegans feel discriminated against, despite the growth of the movement. “If I am successful I hope it will make other vegans feel more confident expressing their beliefs and helping raise awareness for other people to consider this way of living and ensure all ethical vegans are better protected from discrimination. The impact of securing legal protection for ethical vegans in the UK is likely to generate ripples in other countries, potentially sparking new legal protection for vegans where.  “This can only have a positive impact on animals, the environment and public health. Veganism a growing trend The case comes as veganismaposs popularity rises, with the number of consumers around the UK following a plant-based diet quadrupling between  to .  Marketers have leapt on the growing trend, with the range of vegan products on offer in supermarkets and eateries booming nationwide in recent years. According to the Vegan Society, , people in the UK identied as vegans this year- amounting to . per cent of the population - and up from , people in . The society said it is not just vegans driving the change, as supermarkets and restaurants race to cater to the one in three Brits who say they have consciously cut down on meat, dairy and eggs.  The society is backing Mr Casamitjana, whose crowdfunding campaign for his legal battle had reached nearly £, this week. Spokeswoman Dominika Piasecka said: “While veganism clearly meets the requirements for being considered a philosophical belief protected under the Equality Act , this has not been proven in court yet.  “We are eagerly awaiting the outcome of next year’s hearing which we expect will favourably clary the legal status of veganism. “This isn’t of course just about the rights of vegans a society that respects veganism and accommodates vegans also gives expression to the undisputed moral standing and rights of non-human animals.” What is a protected characteristic  The Equalities Act  protects people from discrimination and harassment in their workplace, and when they are using private or public services, on the basis of any of nine protected characteristics. They are: age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. Mr Casamitjanaaposs lawyer Peter Daly, of Slater and Gordon called it a ground breaking case. This case is important not only for Jordi, but the wider vegan community in the UK and globally.  Ethical Veganism is a whole philosophy which guides all of Jordi’s choices from the products he buys, to the transportation he uses and where he invests his money.  We are hoping this hearing will support our view in Jordi’s belief system as similar to a religion and a special characteristic deserving of protection. A aposslippery slopeapos The tribunal will have to decide whether veganism, like religion, meets a series of thresholds that would see it treated as a philosophical belief worthy of protection under the Equality Act .  Nick Spencer, a senior fellow at thinktank Theos, commended Mr Casamitjana for his commitment to his ethical beliefs, but worriedhe wins his case it could transform a moral issue into a legal one. He labelled the case a “slippery slope.” “The concern is that it could have a chilling effectyou’re running a workplace and you have a vegan there you could be very cautious, very concerned that anything you did or say or opinion you gave -they took offence - it could become a legal issue.

Footage shows Liam Cornett cruising around in flashy cars and playing with money during a luxury holiday to the state.The -year-old, nicknamed ‘the Lam’, flew in a helicopter and drove around Monte Carlo in a convertible Bentley with his right hand man Michael Rice, Liverpool Echo reports. Cornett - who exploited vulnerable people to sell drugs - has been jailed for  years today. He was sentenced along with  other offenders involved in a large-scale drug dealing network. Cornett ran the network along with Micheal Rice, , from Liverpool and Kieran Eves, , from Hale, who were jailed for  years and  years respectively. Cornett and Rice funded their lavish lestyle via the massive drugs operation they oversaw. Cornett, who had a home in Huyton, controlled the importation of cocaine, heroin and amphetamines into the UK. Rice oversaw the day-to-day operation on the ground, controlling drugs from their arrival in England to the distribution of the substances and sales all the way down to the streets of Anfield, Hull and Exeter. Riceaposs sentence was added to a six year term already handed out for possession of a handgun.Cornett was described as a “constant thorn in the communities of Merseyside” at an intelligence briefing before his allies were targeted in dawn raids across the UK. Dozens of Merseyside Police officers listened as the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit detailed the targets of Operation Valkyrie in December . Most already knew his name. As he climbed the criminal hierarchy, Cornett’s identity became entwined with the exploits of Liverpool’s underworld. Cornett, who bought a home on Roby Road in Huyton, clocked up a record of dishonesty offences as a teenager before being jailed for affray in .  Yet it was his activity abroad that saw him climb to become one of the most signicant players in the latest generation of Merseyside’s criminal fraternity. In , Cornett was jailed in the Netherlands for crimes that effectively equated to attempted murder, threats to kill and causing grievous bodily harm. The convictions arose from an incident in which he drove at a police officer. The attack was not publicised because Dutch courts do not name defendants. But it was known in police and criminal circles on Merseyside - as was the three year sentence he received.  Cornett eventually based himself in Spain, where he made contacts that gave him to access drugs there and in North Africa. He then organised their importation into the UK and the Netherlands. When he was questioned over the investigation that led to him being jailed this week, he did not deny he was a drug dealer - he instead argued the drug lines he oversaw related to cannabis, not Class A substances. At Cornett’s sentencing hearing in Liverpool Crown Court, Henry Riding, prosecuting, said: “Liam Cornett has a home in Spain. It is common ground that for a number of years he has been involved in criminal activity in Spain, including the organisation of importations of controlled drugs into the UK and Holland from Spain and North Africa. “His evidence was that it was exclusively Class B drugs and that he organised importations both for his own operations and on behalf of other organised crime groups.”  He was not charged in relation to any cannabis conspiracy but Mr Riding said the claims were relevant because they confirmed “he is a sophisticated and experienced criminal who is well-versed in the techniques of drug supply”. The December  raids that shattered his network were the climax of Operation Anvil, which had begun in the summer of , when Cornett was living on the Costa del Sol. By this stage the drug supply lines he controlled in Liverpool. The profits funded a playboy lestyle that saw him in party in one of the world’s most glamorous playgrounds - Monte Carlo, where he flew in a helicopter, rode in a convertible Bentley and was filmed throwing wads of cash in the air. That holiday on the Mediterranean took place in the summer of  and during the opening months of Operation Anvil.  Not content with the huge sums already available to him, around the same time he made extensive efforts to expand his network. In August, September  - apart from the Monte Carlo trip - and October of that year Cornett spent much of his time in the UK plotting new hubs for his enterprise to exploit. First Cardf, where the gang sent amphetamines, then Exeter, where the Liverpool outfit simply took over the local trade and Plymouth, where they teamed up with a prominent local enforcer to sell cocaine and heroin. Cornett would travel to meetings between top-level associates as he agreed the terms under which he would supply his drugs.  Often, detectives tracked lower-ranking figures of his as they travelled separately, sometimes, by train, carrying samples used to entice prospective gangland partners. Once established, Cornett would play a hands-off role on the operations, allowing trusted associates to control the graft phone lines used by addicts to order their fix. From June  to August  the phone number that controlled the Liverpool dealing operation received , calls. From May to July  the Hull line received , calls and in Exeter the phone number received , calls in its first week alone. Detectives from NWROCU teamed up with those from forces on the south coast to bring Cornett down. Undercover police officers posing as drug users captured details about how the gang worked on the ground. Meanwhile, a massive surveillance operation captured snapshots of the gang’s exploits.  In the summer of , Cornett spent nine days in a Dutch prison after ing to the country for a music event and being picked out as an “undesirable alien”. Calls from jail made to his right hand man, Michael Rice, were recorded and revealed him ordering for the network to “stand still”. In November  one of his contacts had his suitcase searched ahead of a flight from John Lennon Airport to Spain. Inside was £,, thought to be destined for Cornett. Police were also aware of him spending £, on a new Audi during the course of their surveillance. In December , Rice was stopped by armed police in an Audi. He was in possession of a Glock handgun and jailed for six years as a result. Despite the capture of his closest associate, Cornett remained active.

It’s the most depressed we’ve felt about any other election in our letime. I’m not going to go on about it because I know everyone has had enough and I know a lot of you are still like me - in mourning at the loss of our beacon of hope. The one and only Jeremy Corbyn. So what do we do when we’re sad  We listen to music, we sing, we dance and we get nominated as a BBC One Show Christmas Angel. What thaaaaa  My lovely Michael Brown had been in touch with an absolute angel at the BBC named Olivia. The two of them schemed together and off I went to London, not having a clue about what was going on. We arrived at London Zoo and we were shown around by Ben, the elf, who eventually led us to Michelle Visage. She was an absolute dreamboat and Ivy fell madly in love with her - she even said to her aposAunty Michelle, I love you more than I love my Mummyapos, little sod. Afterwards, we had to get glammed up for our next surprise - tickets to the Nativity at the Hammersmith Apollo. What an absolutely incredible show. Music, singing, dancing and laughter. The buzz in the theatre was contagious. We got to go backstage afterwards and met the lovely Sharon Osbourne, Rylan and Danny Dyer. Bloody starstruck. All this for little old me! And we were invited to go back to London to be on The One Show whilst they aired our little surprise. What a great experience….Patrick Kielty, Alex Scott, James Norton and Emilia Fox - yeah I’m name dropping but they were all so so sweet to us, especially to Ivy. Even all the backstage crew were dreamy. The studio had such a nice little vibe and now I want to be on telly forever please. As part of my little surprise, the BBC had been in touch with some gorgeous women and friends who follow my blog. It absolutely warmed my heart to see beautul messages from people I don’t even know, who follow my story and who have been affected by my column in some shape or form. There’s not a better feeling than knowing there are people out there you’re helping somehow! I couldn’t help but feel a bit silly once we got home last week - I said to my friend Nat that I keep getting treats and I feel like it needs to stop. But she put me back in my place and reminded me of all the people who benefit from the fundraising and the blog and that it’s perfectly okay to be spoilt every now and again - so I’m going with that. For now, we’re getting fully into the swing of Christmas - our house is just a constant Christmas disco but that’s the way we love it. Music has always played a big part in our lives - Michael toured Japan, Europe and The UK as a drummer in the KBC, we loooove recording songs together at home and it has even been proven that music helps psychologically. Sonos recently did a study which showed quality sound increases your emotions, makes you happier and overall makes you a better human Listening motivates us to exercise more, supercharges our sex lives, sparks new ideas, improves our mood and makes us more productive I % believe this. There are even some cancer centres which have singing groups to help with low mood etc. We’re lucky enough to own a few Sonos speakers at home, they’re incredible because they all link up to each other as well as have voice recognition! “TURN IT UP” .

Writing for the , she says: Does he regret the visit to stay with Epstein  “Yes.” Does he regret the whole friendship  It was around  minutes into the interview – and it was the answer that, for me, changed everything. “Still not,” he said. And told me of the opportunities he was given by Epstein that were “actually very useful …”. It was such a candid admission, such a bald refusal to play the game with any wider apology or regret. It would become the pivotal moment of the entire hour. This is a man – a prince – who did not come to repent. He came to earn back his right to tell the story his way. After that she says she understood and the rest of the interview simply flowed.  She said: Andrew was unleashed. Unstoppable. After a decade of silent frustration, he wanted to tell me everything. He paused being “a royal” and found his voice. She also says he told her things he had no need to reveal - including his trip to Pizza Express in Woking. Days after the interview Andrew was essentially apossackedapos by his mum the Queen from all his royal duties, releasing a bombshell statement about the decision.

This time of year is also special thanks to festive movies, giving and receiving gts, and the chance to catch-up with relatives you donapost see very often. But with the excitement of the holidays, the Bupa care home research found itaposs all too easy for those polled to forget those less fortunate than themselves. Three quarters admitted they get so caught up with all the hubbub of Yuletide they have been guilty of not considering the plight of others. And as many as a third have felt lonely at Christmas at one time or another. To help tackle the issue, more than  Bupa care homes will open their doors on December  - welcoming older people who might otherwise spend the day alone. Joan Elliott, managing director of Bupa Care Services, said: While mince pies and presents will always be festive favourites, itaposs being with friends and family that really makes Christmas Day so special. But not everyone is so lucky and, particularly for older people, thereaposs a risk of spending Christmas by themselves. Thataposs why our care homes will be welcoming guests again this Christmas, to help ensure that nobody has to spend Christmas alone.  The study also found around half would want to be invited over to celebrate the big day with othersthey found themselves alone on Christmas Day. Furthermore,  per cent fear they will one day have to spend the festive period without company. But two thirds have never invited those who would otherwise be alone to share Christmas with them. The study revealed that the Christmas spirit appears to be alive and well in other areas though with  per cent saying the true meaning of Christmas is to spend it with others. Half would consider having socially isolated members of the community over for a festive feast and three in  will check in with elderly neighbours during the holidays to make sure they are okay. In addition to looking out for one another, food is a crucial part of Christmas, according to those polled via OnePoll.Pigs in blankets, turkey and eating lots of chocolate all featured in the top  best things about this time of year. Joan Elliott added: Weaposll be hosting a range of festive activities, and of course our chefs pull out all the stops with the Christmas lunch. The main thing though is that there are other friendly faces to share a joke or a story, and spend the day with. Itaposs the fourth year weaposve been involved with the campaign and weaposre all really excited to be taking part again. The responses have been fantastic, both from guests and colleagues alike.

What started as a whirlwind romance ended with a two-year-old boy dead, his mother jailed for  years for his manslaughter, and his father, Peter Chilvers, yesterday jailed for  months for the domestic abuse which triggered her breakdown.  A court has now heard how Lesicka was subjected to a relentless psychological abuse by Chilvers, a Ryanair pilot.She felt trapped her in a toxic relationship where his cruel, degrading torment drove her to desperation, reports the Manchester Evening News. Chilvers had inflicted a campaign of cruelty against Lesicka, forcing her into degrading sexual acts and into eating hairs he plucked from his head, while he had an affair with another flight attendant, who is mother to his two young daughters. A aposcontrolling monsterapos aposMagdaapos, as she was known to friends, had been a confident young air stewardess when she first met Chilvers, an ambitious young pilot, in . The pair had fallen for each other at their work Christmas party in Germany, when both were working for Ryanair.  After he attended her th birthday party, they chatted on Facebook and slept together for the first time. Soon flight attendant Lesicka and Chilvers were wrapped up love and the lestyle of travel that came with their jobs. Within weeks they had moved in together, and it wasnapost long before Chilvers, the son of retired teachers, soon began to show a bullying side to his character. The first sign came after a drunken night out. Chilvers had vomited everywhere so Lesicka slept on the sofa, to avoid getting any sick on her. When he woke up, Chilvers accused her of not loving him, shouted at her, slammed the doors and banged on a wall. Lesicka ended up apologising to him. It was, prosecutors would later say after their relationship had unravelled with such horrendous consequences, an early indication of the behaviour Chilvers would use to aposintimidate and controlapos Lesicka. He would become, in her words, aposa controlling monsterapos.  It had meant everything to Peter Chilvers to become a pilot. His family had made huge sacrices to help him achieve his dream. As he put it, aposthey all really believed in me and I wanted to succeed in leapos. His parents re-mortgaged their home to help pay the £, it cost to qualy, and his grandmother lent him some of her le savings. Chilvers, originally from Stoke-on-Trent, had first become interested in flying as a teenager who was into gliding. He went on to study modern history and international relations at university, and during his studies the advice of a family friend made him set on becoming a pilot. By January  he and Magdalena Lesicka were aposhead over heels in loveapos.  But when they moved to the UK, Lesicka began to feel more isolated, being further away from her family in her native Poland. She had got a staff transfer after Chilvers moved to Liverpool for work, moving in with him to a caravan in Frodsham, Cheshire, and then a nearby rental cottage, as they embarked on a new le together. But, as time wore on, Chilvers behaviour towards his partner got worse and worse. Prosecutors would later tell how he aposrepeatedly mistreated and bullied her at ever increasing levels to see what he could get away withapos. There was irrational jealousy, picking fights, accusing her of being apostoo friendlyapos with other men when they went out. There was casual sadism, like pinching her - or suddenly holding her nose and mouth, as they kissed, so she couldnapost breathe, only releasing his grip as she squirmed in distress. And there were his rages, with Chilvers backing Lesicka into a corner, banging the wall above her head with his fist as she cowered. He would blame her for these things - or deny anything had happened. Peter Chilvers treated Magda Lesicka asshe was a possession to do with as he pleased, Rob Hall, the prosecutor in his trial said.  A troubled engagement Despite all this, both seemed set on further committment. One day Chilvers took Lesicka to a beauty spot beside Coniston Water, a favourite destination of his family growing up. After a walk there, Chilvers decided to apospop the questionapos, but the moment was killed, according to him, when she said, aposI hope you are not going to propose to meapos. Nonetheless, on February , , a leap year, the day traditionally women propose to men, Lesicka decided to propose to him - hoping marriage would improve things between them. Chilvers accepted, but did not tell his family of the proposal for nine months, something that made her feel like she wasnapost good enough for him. They bought custom made rings from a jewellers in Krakow. But they would never marry. After finding the proposal had not improved their relationship, Lesicka decided to apply for another job. She moved to Dubai, with Chilvers insisting that she only stay for six months. They met up around the world when they could, and jurors heard that the long-distance relationship seemed to suit them better. But when Lesicka ed, they moved to Stoke and Chilversapos controlling behaviour continued.  In  Lesicka got a new job, working for Cross Country Trains, based at Piccadilly station in Manchester. Their relationship was still a dficult one, made worse by Chilversapos affair with his collague. Lesicka found out, and she broke up with him. What she didnapost realise at that time was that she had fallen pregnant with Chilversapos child. Chilvers was angered by the news and demanded that Lesicka have an abortion. On the phone from a holiday in New Zealand with his parents, Chilvers said having a baby would aposruin his career and leapos. In messages, he called Lesicka a aposmonsterapos, a aposbitchapos and a aposselfish c**tapos for wanting to have the baby. The response from Peter Chilvers was to send her a draft legal contract that outlined their responsibilitiesMagda Lesicka kept the baby, prosecutor Rob Hall later told Chilversapos trial. In April , Lesicka again discovered Chilvers was having an affair - with a female member of Ryanair cabin crew. Chilvers was promoted to Captain with the airline and he moved to Lanzarote for work. He showed, prosecutors would claim, aposlittle interest in the pregnancyapos. Cruel bully called fiancee a apossheepapos  James was born in September , and mother and son joined Chilvers in Lanzarote. But soon after that, Chilvers began to tell Lesicka that having the baby had taken his freedom away, and that he felt aposbetrayedapos and aposdisgustedapos with her. Magda Lesicka would do anything for James, including seeking to create a happy home le for him, eventhat meant accommodating Peter Chilvers’s attacks on her personality and decision-making, Mr Hall said. Chilvers throttled Lesicka a number of times. He regularly subjected her to degrading acts, to which she felt she had no choice but to consent. He would pull out hairs from his head and put them in her mouth, before ordering her to aposswallowapos. And he aposmentally demeanedapos her, calling her a apossheepapos and describing himself as a apossheep ownerapos. Later Lesicka learned that despite his promises to end his affair, Chilvers had carried on with it. But when Lesicka suggested that she and James shouldto the UK from Lanzarote, Chilvers told her: If you ever try and run away and hide, I will find you and will kill you.  Hethreatened her thatthe issue of who James should live with after they separated ever went to court, he would have more money than her, he would get better lawyers than her and he would make sure that she never saw James again, Rob Hall told Chilvers trial. In July , the young family moved to Wythenshawe, on a new-build estate close to Manchester Airport. By , Chilvers work base had become Liverpool Airport, so he regularly stayed in Wythenshawe with them, all the while continuing his affair. Later that year, Chilvers bought a home in Cheshire to aposlead a le awayapos from Lesicka, but problems continued. On the occasions when Magda Lesicka summoned up enough courage to talk to Peter Chilvers about the state of their relationship and her desire to end their relationship, he would manipulate her into carrying on, Mr Hall said. At one point in the car, Lesicka dared to confront Chilvers, telling him: You don’t love me. You don’t love James. You just love yourself.  Around that time, Lesicka started to confide with her colleagues about the abuse she suffered, and showed them bruises she suffered at Chilversapos hand. By August  their relationship was in pieces. In the week before Jamesapos death Chilvers went to solicitors to draw up a aposcohabitation contractapos, which stated Lesicka would have to pay £ a month to live with him, and she wouldnapost have any claim to the ownership of the house. He assaulted Lesicka in front of James after losing his temper, pushing her to the floor and sitting on her chest, before tickling her asit was a game. When Lesicka heard that the woman Chilvers had been having an affair with was moving to work from Manchester Airport, Chilvers became angry and threw her phone to the floor, smashing the screen. The lead-up to the tragedy In the days before he died, James went to stay with Chilversapos parents in the Lake District. Lesicka used the time to start making plans for a new le away from Chilvers. She researched rental properties, started to make notes about the abuse she had suffered, took pictures of her bruises, and told her manager at work of what was happening in her relationship. She also went to the police.  Officers planned to arrest Chilvers when he arrived back in Wythenshawe after flying a Ryanair service to Tenere. But when they told Lesicka of their plan, she was fearful of what would happen and begged officers to just log her complaint, rather than carry out the arrest. Chilvers would have been arrested on the day Lesicka went on to kill James. He was due to arrive back at Manchester Airport at .pm on August . As he was landing, Lesicka suffered a apossuddenapos mental breakdown. She stabbed their son to death in an upstairs bedroom at the house on Beaford Road and then tried to commit suicide. When Chilvers arrived back at Beaford Road at .pm, Lesicka fell into his arms, seriously injured.  He took her to hospital, unaware that James was fatally injured. It was only at the hospital that a concern was raised for the young boy. Police arrived at the house at about .am, and found the toddler dead. aposEgocentricapos pilot who blamed everyone but himself Officers were only able to speak to Lesicka about Jamesapos death two and a half months later, as she had originally been detained under the Mental Health Act. Later doctors agreed that Lesicka was suffering from aposan abnormality of mental ing which impaired her ability to understand her own conduct, form a rational judgement or exercise self-controlapos. On those grounds, Lesicka, who had not previously suffered from mental health problems, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. On Facebook in September, Chilvers posted a series of pictures of his son, writing: Jamie, my beautul and wonderful darling. You would have been  today. We all miss you desperately. Two years since your murder and still nothing has been done. On this day, your birthday, I solemnly promise you that I will fight for justice for you darling. I will always love you and always think of you. aposAlways alwaysapos Daddy. But in the sentencing hearing this week, Judge Patrick Field QC told Chilvers he had treated Lesicka as his apospropertyapos.  I have detected no more than a hint of your remorse and I note that even a doctor describes you as egocentric, having a longing for appreciation, and a reduced ability to understand fully how your behaviour affects others, and that you seek to minimise what you have done wrong and seek to sht the blame to others, the judge told him. You apparently have a preoccupation with the injustice of it all. That attitude was on full public display when you gave evidence. Chilvers now has two other children with the cabin crew worker he was having an affair with. His barrister Mark Ford said that relationship shows a dferent side to the defendant, as it is apossupportiveapos, aposco-operativeapos and aposlovingapos.  Chilvers, the defence lawyer said, is aposdeeply traumatisedapos by the death of his son, frequently breaking into aposhysterical screamingapos. It is frankly impossible for anybody to comprehend the ordeal that Mr Chilvers and his family have undergone, Mr Ford said. He is, in short, a man on the edge, and he has been for over two years. The barrister appealed to the judge for Chilvers to be spared jail, because he has no previous convictions and is the aposprimary carerapos of his two children. But Judge Field said he had concluded aposwithout hesitationapos that only prison was justied. As Mr Ford put it, just a few years ago, Chilvers had the aposworld at his feetapos. Now he has lost his job, his freedom, and his young son. aposHe has taken everything from meapos As for Lesicka, in a statement from her jail cell, she described herself as feeling aposugly, worthless, defenceless, ashamed and guiltyapos. I have very little left in my le, she said. Her words were read to the court this week, giving her a voice for the first time as she gave evidence for the prosecution during Chilversaposs Manchester Crown Court trial for abusing her, and prepared a victim impact statement to be read on her behalf at his sentencing In the statement, Lesicka said: Itaposs hard to see myself as a victim given the tragic outcome. I know my le has been changed forever and there is nothing I can do change it back. I have the rest of my le to contemplate these events and it is a daunting prospect. When I started a relationship with Peter Chilvers I had absolutely no idea he would be the controlling monster I discovered him to be. It is important that the public understand what Peter Chilversaposs abuse did to me. It destroyed me. I have no idea how he achieved this and I will probably spend the rest of my le trying to work out how he turned the confident, ambitious me into what I am now. He broke me and I find it almost impossible to contemplate that I let this happen. Living with Peter became an exercise of walking on eggshells. The best way to describe the latter stages of the relationship is it became a power struggle. I tried to leave but he would not let me. I had no power. I tried to break away for the safety of James and myself. I failed because Peter would not release me. I failed because Peter had too much control over me. I lost all my self respect. My only goal was to get through another day.

Aimee Cumbers, , from Essex, has gone from  stone and a size   to a size . She has slimmed down after realising her -stone frame was holding her back. But her incredible weight loss journey is the result of a huge effort after years of struggles to lose weight. Aimee told Essex Live she had struggled with her weight since she was a little girl, and over the years had tried every diet, shake, juice and trick in the book to try to shed the extra pounds. But it was always the same outcome - lose two stone, then gain more. She described herself as a secret eater. Aimee would buy herself sweets and treats to sneak to her bedroom and eat, hiding the evidence from her parents and lying about itthey found any wrappers. But everything changed after Aimee had a holiday which knocked her confidence to rock-bottom. The turning point was in  when Aimee sat on a plane to go on holiday and nearly couldnapost do her seatbelt up. Coming back from her trip, Aimee decided it was time to make a change. Within a year, she had dropped from a size  to size  after losing over seven stone. Now, she is sharing her story in the hope that she can encourage others to take the leap. Between  and , Aimee became more and more self-conscious about the way she looked after she started getting refused for events because of her weight. The worst memory of this was in Turkey , when she realised her seat belt nearly didnapost fit. She said: It happened a couple of times, I went to Turkey one time and the seat belt was quite tight. I just remember thinkingI get any bigger, I’m going to have to ask for an extension, which made me feel embarrassed as I had never been close to that point before.  No one should feel embarrassed to ask for one, but that’s how I felt personally. It was a turning point. Once Aimee landed, she was excited to do all the events they had planned. She said: Once I got to Turkey, we weaposre going to do all these activities like parasailing and I got refused. They said I had to weigh myself and I was too heavy. They just looked at me and said aposno, sheaposs not going onapos. I felt absolutely mortied. I was so embarrassed. That was it, I was self-conscious the whole time and I couldnapost do anything . My confidence was absolutely gone. It impacted on it in so many dferent ways. But it wasnapost just on holiday where Aimee was refused entry. I wasnapost allowed to do Jump Street. We had a party at work and I couldnapost do it because I was too heavy, she said. I looked online before I went and thought, I canapost go. I told them I couldnapost make it. It was just really upsetting, it was more the embarrassment and not wanting to say thataposs the case. Even just normal activities like shopping and eating out became a source of concern.  Aimee was even worried about going to restaurants to eat in public, in the fear that someone might see her and judge her. Shopping was a major ordeal, I couldnapost just go into Primark and pick up certain things. I had to try it on andI was going away it had to all be a body cover up. I just felt awful. Coming back from her holiday in , Aimeeaposs self-esteem had ebbed to an all time low. When her friends suggested joining Slimming World, she did it thinking it would fail like every other diet she had tried. A few of my friends were going and they said aposcome on Aimee, joinapos. I didnapost have much pressure because I had done it before and it hadnapost worked, she said. I had just got back from holiday and I was feeling bloated and I was looking back at pictures and thinking aposJesus, is that me apos After trying a few Slimming World groups, Aimee found the perfect one. She said: I was in the swing of it. I had support from my boyfriendaposs family and they said I could cook the meals. They were having them with me as well which really helped. My family were so supportive and thats what kept me on. Within a year, Aimee had lost just over seven stone, dropping six dress sizes. She has learnt to cook some amazing meals and met so many new friends at her group sessions. I feel like a dferent woman to the one who walked into Slimming World. It felt really good and to get smaller clothes I started noticing that I could walk into Primark and New Look.  Photographs really helped too. On Instagram you have so many people who are going through the same thing and are all so supportive. With hard work and determination, Aimee has kept the weight off since then, including another ten pounds. One of the toughest times of the year has always been Christmas time, which seems to revolve around food. The first Christmas was really dficult because itaposs just food everywhere and thereaposs temptation everywhere. Itaposs always good to have a day off and not over indulge. I remember the first Christmas I had after I joined Slimming World in October, I had eaten what I wanted. I had all the snacks, chocolate but after a few days I was so poorly. I got to Boxing Day and I was so poorly. Your body isnapost used to it anymore and your stomach has shrunk. I couldnapost believe I used to do that. One of the hardest parts, was the constant encouragement from other people to eat and drinkat Christmas time. It was a lot of pressure, it was all the aposcome on, itaposs Christmas!apos and aposyou have to!apos comments, she said. They didnapost understand it was important I didnapost go back to bad habits. You just canapost help not say: aposeat this, eat thatapos andyou say no it just gets worse. Itaposs a lot of pressure. Itaposs just the run up to Christmas with all the Christmas parties, the sweets, the selection boxes - it just revolves around food.

Rachael Prescott says she was also bombarded with condolences for her childrenaposs condition before they were even born. The new mum said during her pregnancy with Charlotte and Annette, now aged one, she was overwhelmed with advice to prepare for their health problems. Rachel and husband Cody were told their twins would probably need open heart surgery straight after birth due to congenital heart disease. But say they were confused as to why doctors seemed more concerned the tots potentially had Downaposs syndrome. The stay-at-home mum and trainee pilot Cody were ecstatic to meet their newborns, who were diagnosed with Downaposs syndrome at birth in , and were just relieved they survived birth because of the possibility of them having a heart condition. Rachael, , describes her twins as her miracles, as the odds of having identical twins with Downaposs syndrome are one in a million. Rachael, from Oregon, US, said: At my first prenatal appointment at around eight weeks, six specialists took turns reviewing the scans and presenting the same results. We sat through similar spiels from each, mystied at their concerns over whether our girls may have Downaposs syndrome, when they without a doubt, did have serious heart defects. Information on navigating their cardiac situation was dwarfed by the push for genetic testing and possible means of abortion. I wanted to explain how far I was from desiring to end my pregnancy, but at that moment I could only sit in silence.  Mum-of-four Rachael said right up until the birth of her twins, even after emphasising her excitement at the thought of adding two extra members to their family, medics continued to express their concerns they may be born with Downaposs syndrome. Rachael and Cody, , were offered further testing to find outthe girls had Downaposs syndrome before they were born but refused, claiming they didnapost care what the results were. Charlotte underwent open heart surgery six months after she was born, but fortunately, Annette was born with no heart defect at all. Rachael said: We came to grips with congenital heart disease and when they were born, we celebrated the news of a confirmed diagnosis of Downaposs syndrome. Doctors usually suggest that twins are born by c-section because it can be risky but our prayers had been answered for a natural birth and two babies not needing to be rushed away to an operating table. We were so grateful and relieved. Those surrounding us however, approached the topic of Downaposs syndrome with timidly.  It was assumed that we were grieving but we quickly assured them the lack of sadness or grief in our hearts concerning our beautul, breathing, moving, hearts beating, baby girls, and their extra chromosomes. After the girls were born, we excitedly dove into all things Downaposs syndrome.

While it might seem like a wonderful le at the time, the morning after can be a dferent story, thanks to the biggest Grinch of all – a holiday hangover. And with shopping to do, family to see and work to wrap up before the end of the year, thereaposs no time for staying in bed. So, what hangover cures really work  From a full fry-up to hair of the dog, we take a look at what you need to do to make yourself feel better and have a very merry little Christmas... Myth: Have a fry up After a heavy night, itaposs normal to wake up craving carbs – and a greasy fry-up certainly ticks all the boxes. But health experts warn that itaposs best not to bring home the bacon. For, drinking causes you to lose nutrients through urine – and a heavy breakfast could trigger indigestion. As a result, a more nutritious breakfast can help you battle a hangover more quickly. Fruit, such as bananas, can help restore potassium and blood sugar levels. Or,that seems a little too zesty, then honey on toast is also easy for the stomach to digest. Myth: Hit the gym Some people may swear by a sweaty gym class to perk them up after drinking too much – but this can actually do more harm than good, as your body is already dehydrated. Instead, itaposs better to go for a brisk walk in the fresh air to release endorphins and improve circulation, in a gentler way.  Myth: Take a painkiller before bed Think that taking a painkiller before bed will stop any impeding hangover  You couldnapost be more wrong. Most over-the-counter painkillers take  minutes to start working and the results only last a few hours. So, by the time you wake up itaposs likely that you wonapost be able to feel any effects. On top of this, painkillers can mix with the gastric acids created by alcohol in your stomach – which could cause damage to your stomach lining. So,you really need to pop some pills, itaposs best to wait and assess your situation in the morning. Myth: Coffee cures all When youaposre feeling sluggish it can be tempting to reach for the coffee for a bit of a buzz. But although coffee isnapost quite as dehydrating as alcohol, it is still a diuretic and could hinder your recovery. If you really need a caffeine hit, try to stick to just one cup before switching back to water.  Myth: Gorge on late night takeaways Itaposs bad news for those who like to end the night with a burger and chips. For, while it may seem like a good way to soak up excess alcohol, fast food can actually irritate your stomach and cause you to put on weight. Instead, itaposs better to eat a big meal before heading out – to line your stomach before drinking alcohol. Myth: Keep going Continuing to drink may delay your hangover but it certainly wonapost stop it. So, itaposs best to have some water with your breakfast rather than an early-morning beer.

He is one who will be here for a while. We will get it sorted soon.“Fin is in the team because he deserves to play. That’s why he has played the majority of our games this season, it’s because he has been excellent.“He has made  appearances and most of them have been starts. For someone so young, I think he holds his own on the pitch and controls the game at times.“There is a lot to him that’s to like. He gives us a balance. Fin will sit there and break things up.“He has been great for us from day one and is very consistent.“He is going to have a really good career.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/Arsalan-Haider-423x564.jpg ","title":"cctv images show the moment customer tackled crook in dundee newsagents","story":"Shocking CCTV images show the moment a crook robbed a city newsagents – and police have revealed they are following a positive line of inquiry into the attempted heist.A Dundee shopkeeper has praised a have-a-go-hero customer who tackled a man brandishing a weapon inside the store.Arsalan Haider, Court Street News manager, released images this week of the incident which police are still investigating.Pictures show the customer #hugging# the man after he had reportedly swung wildly at the -year-old shopkeeper in a fit of rage after demanding cash.Police confirmed they are following a #positive line of inquiry# into the incident which took place on Wednesday December .Arsalan said the woman was a regular customer before thanking her today for her actions during the disturbance which took place shortly after pm that day.Describing the incident he said the man had used a metal frame from a chewing gum stand at the front counter before the customer intervened.He added: #If that customer hadn#t have been here it could have got worse # she massively defused the situation by taking the man outside.#I#d pushed the panic alarm during the incident before he fled the scene.

We all do. My heart will always be there.“Butwe’re going to be relevant in European football and generate more income to invest in the football team and operation, Pittodrie is not an option.”Laying out the figures, Mr Cormack said: “Hearts have just spent close to £ million on one stand.“Let’s say we could replace our two halfway line stands for £m each and the two ends behind the goal for £m each. It adds up to £m.”Aberdeen FC’s commercial director Rob Wicks added: “The real cost is probably even higher because, let’s say you redevelop a stand a year, you’re going to have to take a stand out of commission for a year and there is a loss of income from those stands.”Mr Cormack continued: “It would take five years to redevelop Pittodrie. We would end up with a ,-seater stadium and, because we’re landlocked, there is no ability for us to increase our income, for example, on the corporate side, which we fill out almost every game.”The club sells  premium seating packages per game at Pittodrie.“We think we can get to , at Kingsford,” said Mr Cormack.Before taking on the role, he spent years developing software firms in the US, transforming one – Bright Tree – from a business with a £, annual review in  to £m in .Through two decades of those dealings, he rubbed shoulders with the movers and shakers in the corporate world and helped the Dons forge a major link with Atlanta FC earlier this month.Mr Cormack said: “I know the investment community.“I know all the top guys atGoldman Sachs who, for example, funded with Bank of America Tottenham’s stadium.“I can tell you that my guys who are investing their personal money – there is no-one who will invest in redeveloping Pittodrie.“The market is telling us there is no money at all for Pittodrie.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line.

No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

This year’s winner, picked by the skipper, was Robert ‘Grinch’ MacBrayne.The day started off as expected, pretty cold with a few light showers. Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N.

Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon.

Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet.

to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

A fundamental sht has taken place, not only in Englandrsquos mindset, but the manner in which its voters were induced to back Mr Johnson.What  have we learned from this extraordinary election  Well, herersquos my initial take. I look forward to hearing yours.. The ruthless, despicable tactics used by Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave to win the EU referendum campaign were not an aberration. As Mr Johnsonrsquos victory highlights, they are the new norm. Wersquore going to have to get used to digital s and elements of the media spreading misinformation like wildfire, possible foreign interventions, bamboozling distraction techniques, blatant dishonesty during broadcast interviews. How the Conservativesrsquo opponents respond will be crucial. Play it clean and be crushed, or get dirty, too, and join in them in the moral sell-out  You decide.. Simple slogans ndash especially those created by the aforementioned Cummings ndash really do work. By the end of the campaign just about every voter vox-popped in England seemed to be parroting the ldquowe just need to get Brexit done line. This undoubtedly helped consolidate the pro-Brexit vote around the Tories.. Labourrsquos claim to be the party of working people no longer stands up. Jeremy Corbyn and his disciples can blame media bias for his partyrsquos disastrous result till the cows come home but it wonrsquot change the fact that their man and his policies were a monumental turn-off across the partyrsquos traditional heartlands. Labourrsquos disastrous stance on Brexit didnrsquot help, but the rejection goes deeper. The fact that people living in poverty believed Boris Johnson would look after their interests better than a lelong socialist is both grim and fascinating. Sadly for the poor, we canrsquot bet on Labour facing up to these harsh truths any time soon.. Speaking of Labour claims that donrsquot stand up, we can surely all now agree that a Labour government is not going to ldquosave Scotland, either from the Tories or independence. This ridiculous and out-dated argument was still being peddled on doorsteps, not only by London-based Labour but many in the Scottish party, too. It really would be in the partyrsquos interests to accept that comparing independence ndash which for the vast majority of supporters is based on a simple desire for self-determination ndash to Farage-style nationalism is not only highly insulting, but as wersquove seen for years, electoral suicide. There have been signs over the weekend that at least some in Scottish Labour are waking up. Too little, too late  Quite possibly.. The evisceration of the Lib Dems tells us that Jo Swinson ran a flawed campaign based on a fatal overestimation of her own popularity. It also suggests England doesnrsquot like three-party politics.Or hung parliaments. You can kiss goodbye to any thoughts of electoral reform.. The SNP-Tory stand-off over Indyref cannot go on forever. Both sides are already upping the ante, with Mr Johnson and Michael Gove categorically ruling out another referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon intensying the narrative with talk of Scotland being ldquoheld prisoner. Such shadow boxing plays well to both partiesrsquo core support, of course, but eventually one side will have to go for the knockout blow. Itrsquos hard to see what more Ms Sturgeon can do in the face of such denials and hypocrisyfrom a tin-eared PM buoyed by a right-wing majority, at least until the Holyrood elections of . However Mr Johnson, who purports to be a classical scholar, would do well to learn lessons from more recent events, not least the unstoppable push for devolution that resulted from Mrs Thatcherrsquos condescending and contemptuous attitude towards Scotland during her - year stint as PM. The unpredictable nature of the Johnson-Cummings premiership means you never know what will happen, of course. Will they fancy calling the SNPrsquos bluff  Time will tell.. Meantime, the SNP needs to fashion fresh and persuasive arguments for independence in the post-Brexit world, with palatable solutions to the dficult questions and scenarios created by the UK leaving the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"long-lost-live-recording-legendary-scots-band-josef-k-resurfaces","story":"ldquoThe only thing I really remember is the snare drum breaking, says Haig.Ross recalls how, ldquoIt broke on the first song. Ronnie Torrance, the drummer, had left all his spare skins in the studio in Brussels, so we had to carry on without a snare and improvise for about four songs. Fortunately for us, Lene Lovichrsquos road crew were there, and they lent us their snare drum. Listening to it again, Ronnie copes with it amazingly well. When it broke, it made things seem kind of hard. It was quite a prestigious gig, I remember. We were only playing a short set, but it wasnrsquot a nightclub. It was a theatre set up, and was quite formal and quite staid.The unintended snare drum incident nevertheless gives the recording of Josef Krsquos April  performance an extra edge that can be heard on The Scottish Affair , a lavishly packaged record of the show released on limited edition clear vinyl by Les Disques du Crepescule. The chic Belgian label promoted the concert at the Beursschouwburg venue in Brussels following a multi-media extravaganza on Hogmanay four months earlier. That was at the warehouse-based Plan K alongside Postcard Records label-mates Orange Juice.Josef K had released their debut single, Chance Meeting, on Orange Juice drummer Steven Dalyrsquos Absolute label. Their two follow ups on Postcard, Radio Drill Time and Itrsquos Kinda Funny, mixed angular urgency with downbeat lyrics that made for a kind of existential disco.With Crepescule forging international connections, Josef K had recorded their Sorry for Laughing single for them during their first visit. This captured the raw sound that had eluded them on previous recordings, including that of the album that was awaiting release. They decreed to re-record it in Brussels during their second visit, and it was this that was released as The Only Fun in Town, its seemingly self-sabotaging release foreshadowing the bandrsquos split in August.Ross remembers the Brussels trip as having ldquoa real sense of optimism and excitement that things were moving forward. We did feel we were part of a kind of change of the guard in terms of what was going on musically. Josef K would always try and do something, not totally experimental, but not just the same things that wersquod done before. We were so young then, and I think we were quite naiumlve, trying to find new chord structures and all that, then as you get older and learn more, you realise why theyrsquore structured the way they are.Europe may seem an increasingly distant place right now for a new generation of home-grown talent with ideas above their station. For Haig, Ross and the other members of Josef K, drummer Torrance and bass player Davy Weddell, their first trips abroad as part of what was effectively a trans-global Crepescule salon, it was an adventure. The bandrsquos name may have been drawn from Czech novelist Franz Kafkarsquos existential novel, but Brussels seemed just as exotic.ldquoPaul and I used to read European literature in translation, remembers Ross, ldquoand we always felt we had an affinity with Europe.The European romance they envisaged was slightly dferent from the harsh realities of le on the road. ldquoWe did that terrible journey in a Bedford van, with loads of things going wrong, says Haig, ldquobut when we got to Brussels, it was great to just be able to to a cafeacute and have a proper French coffee. We liked our coffee and cigarettes, but you couldnrsquot get that it Scotland. Then we met the Crepescule crowd, and they had it much more together than we did. They all had flats and everything, and we were these pale little Scottish guys pretending to be sophisticated.The album cover image for The Scottish Affairis a reproduction of the poster for the Beursschouwburg gig, featuring artwork by Jean-Francois Octave that epitomised the ennui of serious young men.

Who are one fan group to deny Conservatives  And how crazy is this in our modern climate There was a time when voting allegiance in Scotland was class-defined and binary.

This social imprint was as fixed as the categories in a caste system.But voting habits have changed. Scotland is no longer simply ided into Right and Left.

Only a third of SNP MPs are women.Back to Labour and the leadership race is underway, awash with female candidates. Eight MPs, six of them women and two of them Keir Starmer and David Lammy, have been touted as candidates for the race.Now, though, there are suggestions that one of those expected to throw her hat in the ring will now run for deputy leader in order to smooth the path for a friend.

Its about time the partys glass ceiling was smashed. Its  years since the Labour Party brought a landslide  female MPs to the House of Commons, doubling the number of women MPs overnight. Let us gloss over the sexist Blairs Babes moniker and move on to the fact the women have been allowed to only go so far.In the words of Barack Obama, speaking this week at a private event on leadership, women arent perfect but,Labour really plans to have a serious spell of introspection, it could start by doing something fresh and new.After saying that women arent perfect, Obama added: \"What I can say pretty indisputably is that youre better than us [men].\"\"Im absolutely confident,\" he said, \"That for two yearsevery nation on earth was run by women, you would see a signicant improvement across the board on just about everything... living standards and outcomes.\"The argument begins to pale a little when you take a glance at two recent examples. Theresa May and Jo Swinson were savaged, neither doing an successful job of leading their respective parties.Theres an unfortunate cliche of women being expected to pick up after men and this extends to politics. It was expected that Theresa May would come in and repair the damage done by David Cameron after he ided the country and scarpered to his pound, designer shed to write about the experience.While Vince Cable did a stand up job of heading the Liberal Democrats, there was still a strong narrative that Jo Swinson, a woman who cant define what a woman is, would be a breath of change, leading the party in a new and fresh direction, a direction towards electoral victory.The problem women leaders face is that, when they are impressive - German Chancellor Angela Merkel, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern - their femaleness is praised as a reason why.Yet when, say, Argentinarsquos Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner defaults on international loan payments, or Australiarsquos Julia Gillard is strong armed out by her own party, the fact they are a woman is held against them.Women are expected to resolve years of inequality almost overnight or be cast as failures.Fact of the matter is, we dont have enough and consistent examples to say that female rulers would outperform men, or even do things dferently from their male counterparts.But studies show that women approach negotiation and politics in a dferent way to men. Earlier this year I was in Sierra Leone visiting a project where, to address poverty, financial structures were placed solely in the hands of women because they were shown to use the money for healthcare, housing, education and entrepreneurship.They focused on the means of lting the whole village, prioritising the treatment of everyone.You would hope that putting a woman in charge of the Labour party would lead to the same priority. The one thing we do know, is that the Prime Minister is not good with women.A female leader of the opposition might be just the thing to unnerve - and eventually unseat - him."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-airport-owners-rumoured-behind-prestwick-takeover-bid","story":"Transport secretary Michael Matheson announced a buyer had been found for the troubled transport hub, which passed into public ownership for pound in .:Preferred bidder chosen to take over Prestwick AirportMr Matheson said the bidder for the airport, operated on a commercial basis and at armsfrom the Scottish Government, could not be disclosed.However, reports in The Scotsman suggest AGS Airports, which also owns hubs in Aberdeen and Southampton, are the group behind the purchase.It is currently unknown whether pound million worth of loans owed to the Scottish Government will be repaid as part of the deal.Earlier this month, the airportreported a total loss of pound. million, including loan interest, for the  months ended March .:State-backed Prestwick Airport posts a fresh lossA spokesperson for the group said: ldquoWe have always stated we would welcome an outcome which s Prestwick Airport to a commercial footing in the private sector.He added: \"We have been monitoring the situation closely following the Governmentrsquos decision to place the airport on the market and will continue to watch with interest."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10818838.jpg?type=article-full","title":"technology-harnessed-bid-preserve-castle-keeps","story":"Historic sites like Broughty Castle in Dundee are increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather eventsHowever, its once strategically important location, on a rocky promontory at the mouth of the river, now leaves it highly exposed to the elements.Using infrared thermography, which involves the use of a thermal camera which takes readings of infrared radiation, the team were able to record temperature dferences of surfaces within the castle, which can offer clues about a wider iety of building conditions including areas of heat loss, dampness, and where insulation might not be working properly.The team also undertook a microwave moisture survey of the building, which uses a sensor to map the moisture content of dferent walls and surfacesand indicate areas ofsaturation.Aureacutelie Turmel, Conservation Science Manager at HES, said:ldquoBy combining the datasets from both these survey methods, we will be able to identy any areas of water entry to the site, and gain insight in to how the water may be moving throughout the building.ldquoThe findings from thissurvey will play a crucial role inthe management and maintenanceof Broughty Castle, as it will helpus to effectively identy wherethe site is vulnerable to water ingress, and direct conservation efforts to mitigate the impacts of increased rainfall.ldquoAs we continue to keenly feel the impacts of climate change here in Scotland, including increased frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall, itrsquos exciting to be able to use cutting-edge technology to such valuable effect and help protect our precious historic sites for future generations, she said."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7795101.jpg?type=article-full","title":"grassroots-project-aims-bring-climate-emergency-closer-home","story":"A GLASGOW energy awareness and food growing project is bringing climate change to the high street.South Seeds, based in Govanhill on the south side of the city, has been working with its community to help improve the look and feel of the area for many years, through a range of lsquogreenrsquo initiatives.Its community garden, for example, created on the disused tennis court at Queenrsquos Park recreation ground, helps local people learn more about growing food and reducing waste and its tool library, which allows residents to borrow DIY and gardening equipment, saves them money and avoids unnecessary use of the natural resources that go in to manufacturing.This year, South Seeds has added climate change workshops which help people answer the question increasingly on everyonersquos lips.ldquoMany people come to the workshops knowing a great deal already, but the overriding question is always ndash what can I do that will really make a dference  explains manager Lucy Gillie.ldquoThis last year has been a phenomenal one for climate change ndash there has been much movement on policy and governments across the world have set carbon reduction targets but what does it actually mean for people here in Glasgow and across Scotland ldquoCarbon footprint is such an abstract term, so the workshops are about putting it into some kind of context.South Seeds launched a community garden to help residents learn how to grow their own produce and reduce wasteMs Gillie adds: ldquoMuch of the target setting in the UK has been prompted by direct action on the streets and extreme weather events. People are watching the bush fires in Australia, seeing the high temperatures and the changes to the weather ndash they are starting to experience it first-hand.South Seeds has led the way in making climate change lsquoaccessiblersquo to local communities since , when it secured funding from The Climate Challenge Fundset up by the Scottish Government and administered by Keep Scotland Beautul.That initial one-year project created the arearsquos first community garden at Agnew Lane and supported residents to access useful energy advice, borrow energy monitors and tackle problems with their energy provider.From engaging directly with residents, working with community groups and agencies across the area, South Seeds realised more information was needed about how to save energy in draughty Victorian tenements.The charity developed its own home energy audit, a home composting programme and energy-saving handyman service and ran a one-year Climate Challenge-funded project which included working with migrants and local businesses.The new workshops tackle a range of issues, taking participants step by step through the nature of greenhouse gases and how they impact upon the planet and measures to combat climate change. These are open to all ages.ldquoScience transcends age, I think, and this is applicable to everyone, says Ms Gillie. ldquoAnd the science is very simple.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Would make a change wouldn’t it ”Yet again we have a Tory Government which lost the election in Scotland, with just six out of  seats and the SNP with , Labour with one and the Lib Dems with four. Yet we will have for the next five yearsTory rule. Where is the democracy in that : Queen’s Speech rules out new Scottish independence referendum: Why SNP are bluffing when they say they want indyref – John McLellanAh but, I hear you say, this was a UK election, live with it. Yet we were told after the  referendum that Scotland was in a partnership of equals. It’s a gey funny partnership, especially as one of the partner nations vows to veto the will of another, which is exactly what Boris de Pfeffel Johnson is doing.This result is not a one-off. This election continued the narrative of two nations: England and Scotland, one turning Tory blue and the other SNP yellow. So now we have had three results where Scotland has voted and made a firm claim to travelling in a dferent direction. Good Friday AgreementFirst came the EU referendum, when  per cent voted Remain and  per cent Leave . Then came the EU election with six seats up for grabs the SNP taking three, the Tories one, the Lib Dems one and the Brexit Party one. Now we’ve had the stunning recent victory for the SNP. We also have  MSPs in the Scottish Parliament to the Tories’ .Yet against all this, Johnson refuses a Section  order to allow the ­Scottish Parliament to conduct a ­referendum on the future of Scotland as to whether or not we should be independent. So the leader of a party with just six seats in Scotland can stymie the will of the Scottish ­Parliament – which has agreed in principle to a referendum.He talks of bringing the nation together. Which nation  The UK is not a nation. England is a nation, Scotland is a nation, Wales a principality and Northern Ireland part of the UK. But check out the Good Friday Agreement which states that “the Secretary of State” should call a referendum “ at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland”.Factor in now that there are more United Ireland MPs than Unionists and indeed that Northern Ireland voted Remain and Boris Johnson doesn’t just need to look northand pay attention and respect to Scotland, but cast his eyes west to Northern Ireland.Indeed when you look at that statement in the Good Friday Agreement, you wonder how the same test should not apply now to Scotland.I cannot see how, Canute-like, the Tories can sustain vetoing Scotland having a choice on its own future. Indeedhe is so sure of the Union, why not put it to the test  He thinks he is on a roll, so Boris, go for it.Christine Grahame is the SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!! Momentumare the new Militant Tendency, no wonder they are heading to the dust bin of history.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen Apparently % voted for political parties that wanted a second Brexit referendum, but now we#ve got the blues.What hope now for the  in  bairns born into poverty Thank goodness we avoided Corbyn#s, Socialism Peter. Look to Socialism in Venasuallia what that would do for us. That whole country is in poverty.Over  million scots voted to remain in the uk nowhere near that amount of scots voted to remain in the eu or for the snp. What is it about democracy you don#t understand  You seem to think you just change the question to suit the answer you claim to have got to a question that was never asked. And then have the gall to say that brexiteers didn#t know what they were voting for.Think about this George. If two years ago I had said Boris would be PM with a landslide every one would have laughed. The phrase is #He who has the last laugh#, Ho, Ho, Ho. Now everyone calm down. The die is cast for Brexit, at last.Not that long ago the Tories and LibDems opposed the minimum wage, so it will be interesting to see which of Labour#s bold ideas become mainstream next..."},{"url":null,"title":"carmichael holds onto his seat ","story":"Alistair Carmichael has been ed as the MP for Shetland and Orkney for a sixth time.The longstanding isles MP won with over , votes, as the SNP were pipped to second place.SNP candidate Robert Leslie garnered , votes compared to Mr Carmichael#s ,.Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservatives came third, Labour fourth and Brexit Party fth, with independent candidate David Barnard coming last.Tory candidate Jenny Fairbairn polled , votes, Labour#s Coilla Drake ,, Robert Smith and anti-monarchy candidate David Barnard garnered  votes.There were  spoiled ballot papers, some of which may have been influenced by campaign by activist Stuart Hill, who called on voters to write #no thanx# across the paper.The result in this constituency is perhaps unsurprising.

They now have  MPs.This included a shock scalp in the form of party leader Jo Swinson, who lost her Dunbartonshire seat earlier in the night to the SNP.Despite being pipped to the post in this constituency, it was the SNP who made big gains across Scotland, taking  more seats. The party#s performance prompted their candidate Mr Leslie to say that a second Scottish independence referendum is something that #seriously# needs looking at.However, that may prove dficult given an incoming government who have said they will refuse to grant one.Boris Johnson has the keys to Number  after securing a majority government for the Conservatives.

The SNP did not do well #because they are a secret Leave party# . They did well because of the absence of credible opposition, notably, from the Labour Party, with its incompetent leadership both nationally and in Scotland. Labour has gone from being the predominant Scottish party for decades to fourth position, behind the LibDems, with a single MP who stated in his election speech that #Labour must change or die.#Labour#s demise was well under way, long before Brexit arrived on the scene.So why did ex-Labour voters in Scotland vote for a secret Leave Party while ex-Labour voters in England voted for an up-front Leave Party!My grievance with Westminster is not #phoney#..."},{"url":null,"title":"challenging year with amazing achievements amenity trust report states ","story":"It has been a busy period for the organisation which has also had a number of well-publicised financial challenges in recent years and is now under new leadership with a focus on effective governance.The review provides a summary of some of the key activities the trust has undertaken over the past financial year.Highlights include the Hans Holbein exhibition which saw the trust exhibit one of the most important artworks ever to come to Shetland.Shetland Amenity Trust chairwoman Ruth Mackenzie.As a lead partner the trust also hosted the Follow The Vikings Roadshow which toured Europe with a professional cast engaging world-wide audiences in our Viking heritage.A range of environmental improvement, natural and cultural heritage projects and services were also delivered for the benefit of Shetland.The trust’s work ranges from Da Voar Redd-up to tree planting, from the Sumburgh Head lighthouse to the museum and archives, and from Shetland Wool Week to the regional archaeology service.The trust’s accounts for   were fully audited and demonstrated that the organisation had managed to reduce its debt by over  per cent from the previous financial year.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#. So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.Does this statement mean that the average shetland family would be able to obtain electricity cheaper on the commissioning of the project  Would it be possiblethe turbines were commissioned prior to the connector cable being commissioned then could the power be made available locally at reduced pricing  This looks like so much greenwash and so many weasel words to a community whose council has a vested interest in rolling over and playing dead. What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered..."},{"url":null,"title":"development officer at shetland tourism association 2 ","story":"A unique opportunity to work with and support tourism businesses throughout Shetland.The STA is seeking a motivated inidual with a passion for tourism for a fixed term  year post.The postholder will work  hours per week on a self-employed basis.Tasks will include website updates, liaising with members and industry bodies, arranging member events, overseeing the implementation of the Tourism Strategy and producing reports as required."},{"url":null,"title":"hjaltland housing association ","story":"HAS AVAILABLE TO REGISTERED APPLICANTSpayable £. p.c.m.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud. I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"boxing promoter bob arum apologises for ira comments as frampton and conlan say no malice intended","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These were respite days for families of young people and adults who have a learning disability. \"It was a fun-filled time with craft activities, food and games, all set in the middle of a church family who are practically showing love and care. \"The true joy of Christmas is about giving of ourselves and enabling others to embrace what is good and at the heart of this time of the year, even when they may find it hard.\"The Methodist President, the Rev Sam McGuffin, referred to the \"scientically proven\" causes of stress at Christmas: the absence of a beloved one, family misunderstandings, economic dficulties, tiredness, loneliness and \"seasonal emotional disturbance\".Rev McGuffin referred to \"a stressful year\", noting the failure to get Brexit done, the absence of the Stormont Executive and mounting political, social, civil and economic problems.He added: \"I believewe were to view Christmas as Gods Greatest Adventure, then we would begin to get some real spiritual sparkle back into Christmas and have a less stressful celebration of this wonderful season. \"I pray for you, and for us all, the most wonderful Christmas and a blessed New Year.\"In a joint statement the Church of Ireland Bishop of Clogher Dr John McDowell and the Catholic Bishop Dr Larry Duffy referred to \"the many signs of darkness\" in todays world.However, they stressed that Christians have good news to tell \"and we are called to proclaim it together by our actions\".\"A very good example of this is to be found in the joint initiative of the Churches in Ireland on the question of housing insecurity and homelessness. \"Last September a series of practical resources around this question, for use in our Church communities, was launched by the Irish Inter-Church Meeting.\"May each of us this Christmas be a light to the world, most especially through our outreach to those in need, and those who are marginalized by economic and political circumstances.\"Dr Noel Treanor, the Catholic Bishop of Down and Connor, referred to the current times of profound change \"which can generate fear, anxiety, insecurity and despair\". He spoke of signs of \"a growing polarisation in society, politics and even in the Church\" which spawns intolerance, insecurity and indference.Dr Treanor added: \"In contrast the luminous guidance of faith provides a source of constancy within the darkness of hopelessness. \"Across the world, the Christian message of hope continues to resource hope, even in places where historically there were no supportive structures for the practice of faith in society. \"Christmas invites us to bear prophetic witness to the ever-new vision of le revealed in the living Word of God, incarnate in Jesus Christ.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/000ad/38796044.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/n%20Ireland%20036%202.jpg","title":"northern irelands health service cant survive another winter without change","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have , people on the waiting list for a hospital appointment and we have a severe nursing shortage, which is highlighted by the NMC figures,\" added Ms Cullen.\"Our members have been out on strike to fight for patient safety and to improve conditions for everyone. Quite simply, we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the problems facing the health service.\"Another winter like this and the health service will be irreparably damaged.\"Further strikes are planned for January  and  ahead of the January  deadline for politicians here to re-establish the Assembly.A breakthrough to bring an end to the health service crisis appeared unlikely on Wednesday night, with the relationship between the Secretary of State, the Department of Health, unions and politicians disintegrating even further.Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has refused to budge from his position that health is a devolved matter.After roundtable talks with the political parties, he said again he was unable to intervene and approach the Treasury for additional funding.However, unions have rejected this stance. They have also accused Mr Smith of using the crisis as leverage to force the political parties back into talks to re-establish the Assembly.Patricia McKeown from Unison launched a stinging attack on the head of the local Civil Service, David Sterling.He and the permanent secretary of the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, have insisted that they cannot bring pay into line with the rest of the UK because it would mean overturning a ministerial decision.In an open letter to Mr Sterling, Ms McKeown argued this position was incorrect and hit out at comments he made in a letter sent to the leaders of the political parties on Tuesday.In the correspondence, Mr Sterling said that in order to meet pay parity demands, the Department of Health would need an additional £m every year.He said this money could alternatively be used to pay for additional activity to reduce the number of people on waiting lists each year by ,.\"It is important to note that other Northern Ireland departments are currently dealing with serious budgetary pressure, including pay pressures,\" he wrote.\"Indeed, there are currently industrial disputes in other parts of the public sector.\"The principle of public sector pay parity is clearly cross-cutting, with potential implications well beyond health.\" In response, Ms McKeown hit out at the fact that Mr Sterling has still not responded to a letter Unison sent to him on November , in which the union sought his intervention to resolve the ongoing dispute.Describing Mr Sterlings letter as \"a deeply unhelpful intervention\", she said she was \"shocked by the apparent attempt to mislead party leaders and the overtly political tone of the letter\".She said a letter from the five political parties providing cover to allow civil servants to meet unions pay demands was sufficient political authority for him to act.\"This having now been provided, we seriously question your failure to act,\" she added.She also said Mr Sterling and the Department of Finance have been creating pay policy in the absence of ministers, such as a recent announcement of a review of public sector pay.Ms McKeown also rejected the argument that there was no ministerial decision to break parity and said that it had instead been argued that the move was necessary to enable the Department of Health to break even.She added: \"We have repeatedly stated that the Treasury should provide whatever additional resources are needed to restore the pay gap.\"You have a clear role in making that argument to them.\"Health workers have kept the system running in the face of continued cuts and austerity.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic and travel latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

The DUP are also seeking changes to ensure the assembly is more stable going forward, and cannot be pulled down readily.Mr Wilson said it was strange the UK Government had been unwilling to blame Sinn Fein for its role in the crisis but suddenly Mr Smith was \"pointing the finger\" at the DUP.\"If he had a rush of blood to the head yesterday hopefully now he is going to go back to being impartial on these issues,\" he said.Mr Wilson added: \"We wanted to move forward and have as quick an outcome to these talks as possible but we will not be simply accepting any kind of deal just to satisfy his desire to have the assembly up and running.\"He said he did not want the process to drag on.

Sinn Feins Michelle Gildernew won the seat with a majority of just  votes over the UUPs Tom Elliott. A candidate who wants to contest an election result has only  days to do so.New MP and leader of the SDLP Colum Eastwood has called for a full review of Northern Ireland’s voting system and Electoral Office processes. Mr Eastwood said he will raise the matter with the Secretary of State Julian Smith.The whistleblower told the BBC that:Valid applications for postal votes were rejected by the Electoral Office due to errorsSome applications to register to vote were only processed  hours before the deadline to submit additional evidence, such as proof of identity or addressPotential voters were given an incorrect date for the deadline to submit additional evidence to support their applicationHelpline operators on one occasion were asked to share one Nokia phone to field calls from all over Northern IrelandSteve Aiken said: \"Confidence in the electoral system is absolutely essential.\"If the serious allegations from the whistle-blower are confirmed, then last weeks’ election was neither fair nor open for potentially thousands of voters across Northern Ireland.\"Allegations of members of the public being deliberately mislead over deadlines would be especially unforgivableproven to be true. \"Even before these latest allegations came to light my Party had serious concerns regarding the recent operation of the EONI and we had planned to pursue this directly with the organisation.\"We were aware of examples of hand delivered applications for votes – for both new registrations and for absent votes – simply never being processed and when we sought explanations we were told the forms were never received. Crucially, we have examples of such forms being delivered in person to Belfast for voters in the Fermanagh  South Tyrone constituency.\"The centralisation of the EONI to Belfast has been a total disaster. Phone lines were jammed, paperwork was going missing and clerical errors were common-place.\"We are currently taking legal advice in relation to what steps we may now take.”The Chief Electoral Officer Virginia McVea released a statement to the BBC. She said: \"The team at EONI work tirelessly for the people of NI and have done for many years. NI receives expert service from an expert team.Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland Virginia McVea.\"We, like every electoral team across the UK have to employ temporary staff at election times to answer the thousands more calls we get.\"Our phone system is adequate but BT lines were down in Belfast one day.\"We followed their advice on what to do and were treated as priority urgent customers but we have no way to control external infrastructure failures. The staff are well trained over a number of days and continually supported.\"\"Very importantly it is our whole team, including me, who answer queries and resolve issues through the election period by phone email and in person.\"We are very well used to dealing with queries as our team is expert. Staff advised the public to get evidence in by  December at the start to be sure they would have it in in time.\"In the last few days of the lead up staff told people  December and every single piece of evidence to midnight on  December was processed.\"I have been able to double-check that. All election timetable dates were on our website and available throughout the election.\"\"We are duty bound by law to keep processing until the deadline and so its true sometimes we have to ask for evidence right up to the last hours, evenwe think a person could not get information in in time, because that is the right of the public and indeed they will go on the register albeittoo late for voting that time\".Mr Eastwood described the claims as \"signicant\".\"The claims made by a whistleblower this morning are signicant and confirm reports we have received from a number of people who tried to vote in the election only to be told they were not on the register.\"The SDLP raised concerns on an inidual basis with the Electoral Office but it’s clear that there must be a full review of the processes which led to this.\"People must have confidence in the democratic process. I understand that there was an immense amount of pressure on the Electoral Office and the closure of regional offices has contributed in a big way to that pressure. But there is no excuse for disenfranchising people.\"The SDLP has consistently made representations to the Electoral Office about comprehensive oversight of registration, postal and proxy voting. A full review is now necessary and I will be raising the matter with the Secretary of State today.\"The whistleblower claimed he lost his job after advising a caller to the helpline to contact a local councillor with a complaint about the registration process.\"I felt like a lot of people were being impacted... a lot of people were very upset. Members of the public were phoning and finding out they wouldnt be able to vote in the election, people that had followed all the given steps and done everything correctly.\"There was a massive backlog of registrations that the electoral office needed to process and they didnt have the manpower to do it.\"The whistleblower said that ten agents answered helplines in the office in a working environment he described as \"chaos\".On one occasion, the helplines failed and they were given one Nokia phone to pass around to field calls from all over Northern Ireland, he alleged.He said a backlog in voter registrations sat for several weeks, leaving voters only days to send evidence to prove address, which is usually only requested after an initial application is filed.There was also internal confusion over when the deadline to register was, he said.\"A Thursday at the start of December, I came in and asked  the deadline was last night. And there was a  minute debate about when the deadline was. We told people that it was the third [of December], in reality it was actually the fourth.\"We were told \"dont tell people its the fourth\". On the letters we sent out it was clearly given as the third. We didnt even know what time [the deadline] was.\"The whistleblower said he was worried about the number of people the alleged issues around voter registrations may have affected.\"I would fear for the amount of people who just thought everything was OK. When it came to December , wait - whats going on here \"\"The only reason I know this is because people rang chasing it up,\" he said. In a further statement, Ms McVea said: \"Deadlines to register to vote are set in law. All applications receive before the deadline were processed in time for every successful applicant to be on the register in time to vote on December  election. \"It is a requirement in law that application forms are checked and we are required by law to seek additional advicewe cannot match the personal data against records. \"All absent vote application forms were processed in accordance with the law.\"Sinn Fein MP Francie Molloy has said the Electoral Office must be held fully to account in the wake of serious allegations about the operation of the office.Mr Molloy said: \"If people can’t get registered then they are denied their most fundamental democratic right. \"There are clearly serious issues around the competency and effectiveness of the Electoral Office in relation to registration, postal and proxy voting applications and other matters during the most recent election campaign.\"There are allegations which go way beyond human error and incompetence. This needs urgently addressed. \"We also warned the Electoral Office that closing local offices would lead to further problems. \"If these serious and deeply worrying allegations are veried, and they certainly reflect the experience of people who contacted Sinn Fein, those responsible for the operation of the Electoral Office at its most senior level must be held fully to account.\"People had until .pm on November  to register to vote in the General Election."},{"url":null,"title":"ireland and uk trade deal has been made more difficult says varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was a mistake and I accept responsibility for that mistake.”Speaking to reporters in Dublin on Friday, he saidshe had won the by-election last month, she would not have lasted long in the Fine Gael Party.Ms Murphy has said she will mull her future over Christmas and may run as an independent candidate.Mr Varadkar said: “Quite frankly I’m glad she didn’t win. What we have seen in her recent interviews is that she unfortunately does harbour these views towards migrants. We heard the comments about the Wexford bridge and London Bridge… that is raising the sceptre that migration may result in terrorist attacks in Ireland and that is just not factual.“It was really inflammatory and I think it feeds into the kind of racist views that are unfortunately harboured by some people in our society.“I think we would have heard more of it from her only it would have been coming from a TD and I don’t think she would have lasted long in Fine Gael for a number of reasons.”“These are clearly views that she holds and they are not acceptable in the party that I lead. They are not in accordance with Fine Gael values. This is a party that embraces migration – migrants strengthen our economy and our public services and enrich our society.”Mr Varadkar said he had initially been impressed by Ms Murphy for her role in the Road Haulage Association and her knowledge of Brexit issues, but her views on migrants were not consistent with Fine Gael values.“She was impressive in terms of how she made something of herself….She was very vocal and very outspoken and I thought she would be a good addition to the party,” he said.“I had never heard her express anti-migrant or racist views and no one  told me that she did. Once she did, it came as a big surprise and I take responsibility for that.“The truth is when you are captain of a team, from time to time, people let you down. If they don’t change their ways, you take them off the team and I have had to take a number of people off the team in the past number of weeks and some people will not be candidates for us in the general election when it comes.”On Friday morning, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told RTE radio Ms Murphy was deselected as a general election candidate for the party as her views on society were not consistent with the tone and values at the heart of the party."},{"url":null,"title":"bricklayer topples nemesis to become new world pie eating champion","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While the majority of the content was in Arabic, Twitter said the tweets also amplied discussions about sanctions in Iran and appearances by Saudi government officials in Western media.Twitter’s announcement underscores the fact that misinformation concerns are not limited to the US and Russia.“Governments have started to launch influence campaigns the same ways commercial enterprises launch campaigns to sell detergent or cars,” said James Ludes, a national defence expert who teaches international relations and public policy at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island.He said the Russian efforts in  showed it was possible to “actually change public attitudes through the targeted use of social media”.While the attempts to root out the campaigns may seem like a game of whack-a-mole, he said companies have at least shown progress in taking steps to identy and root out manipulation campaigns run by foreign powers.Twitter began archiving tweets and media it deems to be associated with known state-backed information operations in . It shut , Chinese accounts that targeted Hong Kong protests in August.The , accounts removed and added to the archives are part of a larger group of , accounts engaged in “spammy behaviour” across a wide range of topics. But Twitter is not disclosing all of them because some might be compromised accounts.The Twitter accounts were linked to a social media marketing firm in Saudi Arabia called Smaat that managed many government departments in Saudi Arabia. The accounts used third-party automated tools in order to amply non-political content at high volumes. Twitter said that activity was used to mask the political manoeuvrings of the same accounts."},{"url":null,"title":"502425","story":"“I try to move my head to look around. Nothing happens. I try moving my arms, my legs I try shting my body in the bed. The white sheet that is covering me doesnt move. Nothing moves. I panic and scream, but I hear nothing – only the beeping machines. I havent made a sound.”A Return to Duty followsClodaghDunlop from Magherafelt as she fights to regain control of her body – even learning to breathe again – following a stroke at the age of .After collapsing while working the night sht on April Fools Day,Clodaghsoon found herself unable to move or communicate, while being aware of everything that was going on around her. This fit and active PSNI officer, who ran four miles a day, is suddenly faced with the prospect of never talking, walking or having a normal le again.The early chapters of the book make for terrying reading.Clodaghdescribes how the inability to move or talk can turn simple thingsinto hours of unimaginable torment.Imagine lying in an uncomfortable, painful position, just adjusting an inch would help, but knowing that you will stay in that position for hours and hours on end. Or worse still, when you fear that the unbearable heat in the room is literally a matter of le and death. ForClodagh“every night feels like a Bear Grylls extreme survival challenge.”The long road to recovery begins with a blink.From hereClodaghs world begins to grow again and its from there thatClodaghs story becomes something truly amazing. Its not just that she overcame locked-in syndrome that is remarkable, but the strength and grace she displayed as she overcame it.Finding ourselves inClodaghs position, I think a lot of us would be broken fairly quickly, worn down by the boredom and the pain and frustration. Happy moments for others would be bitter reminders of all we cant have, the normal day-to-day problems of our loved ones lives would seem insignicant to what we are dealing with. Many would turn away from the world, lost in self-pity.ButClodaghseems to have superhuman drive and determination. She became a police officer after six failed attempts. Before her stroke she travelled around Africa in a tentand skyed in Namibia. This locked-in syndrome messed with the wrong woman – she is a lionheart.It says everything aboutClodaghas person that when she cant even raise her hand, she worriesthat her partner isnt eating right at home. When a family argument swells up, she blinks four times – at that stage pretty much the maximum physical movement she is capable of – to lighten the mood.Even when she finally is able to communicate through a spelling board, she puts the feelings of others above what must be her aching need to be heard again after so much silence. In some of her first words with her partner, she makes sure that he apologises for the way he spoke to a nurse. She spells out jokes so that people wont feel uncomfortable when they visit her.Which is not to say that everything is rosy onClodaghs journey to recovery. The dficult parts are here too – the fights and frustrations, the tears and tantrums, setbacks and dark moments – all here without being glossed over. Maybe thats the policewoman shining through in her writing – this is the way it really was. Just the facts. googletag.cmd.push Here too is the truth of dealing with an imperfect NHS. Some staff ignore or patroniseClodagh, or think it makes sense to ask questions like “Whats wrong ” to a person who can only answer with blinks.Others treat her with the utmost care and kindness, nurses who take the time to put themselves in their patients shoes, to sing to them, to go out of their way to find a special item that means the world to a patient.A lot of books like this are about people in recovery – they say they are in it, a passive environment they find themselves in. A Return to Duty is dferent because it is about creating your own recovery. Its a testament to looking a crisis dead in the eye, then putting your head down, gritting your teeth and slowly grinding out a victory.Clodaghs story is one of determined struggle and mental strength when the worst – and this is the worst – has happened. It is a story of continued hope, when hoping seems utterly pointless, even damaging.“I must block my ears to anything negative,” she says, and keeps pushing and pushing and justwill notaccept the situation.Heres hoping that this book is there to provide advice to the NHS on improving stroke services, insight to families struggling to understand what their loved one is going through and comfort to someone dealing with locked-in syndrome, who can be read this book and know they are not alone.A Return to Duty is available to buy now at local bookstores or online atwww.beatinglockedin. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They have also been the standard bearers in Ulster and a commanding display against Antrim champions Dunloy saw them lt a third Ulster title. Derry CCCs reformatted structure has breathed a new lease of le into intermediate and junior hurling. Banagher were intermediate champions but, like Lavey and Swatragh before them, they fell short in their Ulster campaign. At junior level, Coleraine were back as champions and romped to Ulster success and join Slaughtneil in the quest for All-Ireland glory next month. googletag.cmd.push  – Daryl McDermott One of the biggest surprises was the fact Sticks has yet to pick up a hurling All-Star, after being selected in the intermediate football team last year. Cool, calm and collected , his puck-outs were the launchpad for Banaghers attacks. Had a slip in their Ulster clash with Naomh Eacuteanna but flawless otherwise and will surely be highly sought out by both John McEvoy and Rory Gallagher. Oisin ODoherty is more than a worthy mention for his Ulster final performance against Dunloy on his comeback. [st All-Star]  – Karl McKaigue The Emmets defender missed out on last years selection but is back to his consistent best. When Ryan Farren scored an early point for Lavey, he was moved across on him and blotted him out. In the final, he was briefed to pick up Niall Ferris and did so with little fuss. He helped keep Middletown to a mere eight points but it was in the Ulster final where he really earned his stripes with an expert shackling of Dunloys Conal Cunning. [th All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly Its a first award since  for the experienced defender who had a selection in the forwards in . He was a vital cog in Derrys defence under John McEvoy and carried his form into club action. Against Ballinascreen in the semi-final, he held Ryan Scullion scoreless. In the final against Slaughtneil he played a captains part. He held Seacute McGuigan scoreless, was immense, repelled attacks and was unlucky to end up on the losing team. [th All-Star]  - Pearse Dallas A first award for the Eoghan Rua defender who caught the eye on their way back to the All-Ireland stage.Of their five championship games, they have shipped just one goal and Dallas has been pivotal to that record. He had a fine outing against Na Magha and hasnt put a foot wrong since, excelling in the Ulster final against Newry Shamrocks – his side’s toughest test to date. [st All-Star]  – Eamon McGill For the second year in a row, Lavey have negotiated the opening round of the senior championship and McGill has been the central figure. Despite defeat to Slaughtneil, he powered his way forward to score Laveys goal.He gets the spot ahead of Mark Lynch, who he edged for man of the match against Banagher. Lavey trailed by seven points but McGills goal led the fightback. When the Feeny men chased the game late on, he was back winning breaking ball in Laveys defence. [nd All-Star]  – Shane McGuigan After being handed a debut by Michael McShane in the  Ulster final defeat to Cushendall, he has been an ever-present in Slaughtneils defence. In a defensive unit thats all about match-ups, he went up against Keelan Molloy in their win over Dunloy. Molloy scored - from play during the season but McGuigan blotted him out and was still able to operate at centre-back. Richie Mullan didnt score from play off him in the county final either. [th All-Star]  – Meehaul McGrath Played at centre-forward as a runner under Collie McGurk for Derry and also had spells up front for his club. In the absence of Paul McNeill, McGrath has been shted back and in his role at wing-back he enjoyed a great season. He kept Corey OReilly to a point from play in the county final. Against Dunloy, he was paired with the strong running and direct Nigel Elliott. He made a goal saving intervention, cut out a dangerous diagonal ball and floated over a point of his own. [nd All-Star] LISTEN - Michael McShane happy for Slaughtneil to silence the doubters...  – Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated player since these awards began, McKaigue picks up a ninth award. In Slaughtneils cause, he leads and everyone follows. He lashed over four points in their facile win over Lavey and in the county final, he shaded a war of attrition against Thomas Brady but he saved his best for last. Once again he was tasked with putting Paul Shiels on the back foot and he did just that with a surging run in the opening moments that set the tone. [th All-Star]  – Gerald Bradley Was hurler of the year in  and followed suit this season. He registered - against Lavey, including the goal that broke them. In the final, it was Bradley who would pop up to win possession after a Kevin Lynchs score. Ballycran didnt play a sweeper against Dunloy but when McShane dropped Bradley back there for the final, his aerial ability and positional sense set them up. Then, of course, there was his monster score to cement his sides early control. [th All-Star and Hurler of the Year]  – Sean Leo McGoldrick A first award for McGoldrick who has been Coleraines ray of light on their march to the All-Ireland semi-final. It took him one game more, but he matched Cormac ODohertys championship tally of -.Ever-accurate from frees, he offered much more and he landed a super point from out on the wing against Newry Shamrocks in the Ulster final after he had his initial shot blocked. Thats the natural instinct he brings. [st All-Star]  – Cormac ODoherty Still only , the Emmets wizard picks up a fth award. By his own standards, he was quiet in the Ulster final but scored the penalty he won himself. His duck that allowed Gerald Bradley to float over the wonder point highlighted his awareness. He scored - as they downed Kevin Lynchs but its the overall link play that sets him apart. He floats between wing and centre forward, while also popping up behind midfield. [th All-Star]  – Brendan Rogers While making his name as a blistering inside forward, this years campaign saw him play on the wing. It forced teams to reshuffle their plans. He was a puck-out target but still ghosted into scoring positions. His side looked in dire straits in the county final before Rogers manoeuvred his way past the converging Kevin Lynchs defence to land the crucial goal. Pulled a save out of Ryan Elliott in the Ulster final and took Kevin Molloy for three points. [th All-Star]  – Niall Ferris Ferry has already picked up three junior football awards in the colours of Drum. He scored in every league game to help Kevin Lynchs into the top two and clinch a semi-final spot.They were pushed to the pin of their collar against Ballinascreen but Ferris weighed in with -. His goal was fortunate but his positioning was perfect to capitalise on an error by Sean McBride to clinched the game. One of two players to score from play off Karl McKaigue. [nd All-Star]  – Tiarnaacuten McHugh McHugh had an impressive  championship. Derry manager John McEvoy liked what he saw and called the youngster into his plans. He led the Kevin Lynchs attack once again and in the final against Slaughtneil he tormented Sean Cassidy with his uncanny knack of winning possession. When Mark Craigs high ball landed in the square, his presence was enough to put off Morgan McEldowney. After half-time he crashed the sliotar to the net to put the Lynchs in the box seat. [st All-Star]  – Jerome McGuigan Michael McShane has a track record of putting his faith in newcomers and McGuigan paid him back with - from play across four championship games. Scored four times against Lavey to nail down his spot for their pressure-cooker final against Kevin Lynchs. Massive in stature but still has a deft first touch. He gave Dunloy a dferent dimension to consider and allowed the Emmets to build a dferent shape to their attack with Rogers at wing-forward. Edges out Banaghers Tiarnaacuten McCloskey.

They have also been the standard bearers in Ulster and a commanding display against Antrim champions Dunloy saw them lt a third Ulster title. Derry CCCs reformatted structure has breathed a new lease of le into intermediate and junior hurling. Banagher were intermediate champions but, like Lavey and Swatragh before them, they fell short in their Ulster campaign. At junior level, Coleraine were back as champions and romped to Ulster success and join Slaughtneil in the quest for All-Ireland glory next month. googletag.cmd.push  – Daryl McDermott One of the biggest surprises was the fact Sticks has yet to pick up a hurling All-Star, after being selected in the intermediate football team last year. Cool, calm and collected , his puck-outs were the launchpad for Banaghers attacks. Had a slip in their Ulster clash with Naomh Eacuteanna but flawless otherwise and will surely be highly sought out by both John McEvoy and Rory Gallagher. Oisin ODoherty is more than a worthy mention for his Ulster final performance against Dunloy on his comeback. [st All-Star]  – Karl McKaigue The Emmets defender missed out on last years selection but is back to his consistent best. When Ryan Farren scored an early point for Lavey, he was moved across on him and blotted him out. In the final, he was briefed to pick up Niall Ferris and did so with little fuss. He helped keep Middletown to a mere eight points but it was in the Ulster final where he really earned his stripes with an expert shackling of Dunloys Conal Cunning. [th All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  – Paddy Kelly Its a first award since  for the experienced defender who had a selection in the forwards in . He was a vital cog in Derrys defence under John McEvoy and carried his form into club action. Against Ballinascreen in the semi-final, he held Ryan Scullion scoreless. In the final against Slaughtneil he played a captains part. He held Seacute McGuigan scoreless, was immense, repelled attacks and was unlucky to end up on the losing team. [th All-Star]  - Pearse Dallas A first award for the Eoghan Rua defender who caught the eye on their way back to the All-Ireland stage.Of their five championship games, they have shipped just one goal and Dallas has been pivotal to that record. He had a fine outing against Na Magha and hasnt put a foot wrong since, excelling in the Ulster final against Newry Shamrocks – his side’s toughest test to date. [st All-Star]  – Eamon McGill For the second year in a row, Lavey have negotiated the opening round of the senior championship and McGill has been the central figure. Despite defeat to Slaughtneil, he powered his way forward to score Laveys goal.He gets the spot ahead of Mark Lynch, who he edged for man of the match against Banagher. Lavey trailed by seven points but McGills goal led the fightback. When the Feeny men chased the game late on, he was back winning breaking ball in Laveys defence. [nd All-Star]  – Shane McGuigan After being handed a debut by Michael McShane in the  Ulster final defeat to Cushendall, he has been an ever-present in Slaughtneils defence. In a defensive unit thats all about match-ups, he went up against Keelan Molloy in their win over Dunloy. Molloy scored - from play during the season but McGuigan blotted him out and was still able to operate at centre-back. Richie Mullan didnt score from play off him in the county final either. [th All-Star]  – Meehaul McGrath Played at centre-forward as a runner under Collie McGurk for Derry and also had spells up front for his club. In the absence of Paul McNeill, McGrath has been shted back and in his role at wing-back he enjoyed a great season. He kept Corey OReilly to a point from play in the county final. Against Dunloy, he was paired with the strong running and direct Nigel Elliott. He made a goal saving intervention, cut out a dangerous diagonal ball and floated over a point of his own. [nd All-Star] LISTEN - Michael McShane happy for Slaughtneil to silence the doubters...  – Chrissy McKaigue The most decorated player since these awards began, McKaigue picks up a ninth award. In Slaughtneils cause, he leads and everyone follows. He lashed over four points in their facile win over Lavey and in the county final, he shaded a war of attrition against Thomas Brady but he saved his best for last. Once again he was tasked with putting Paul Shiels on the back foot and he did just that with a surging run in the opening moments that set the tone. [th All-Star]  – Gerald Bradley Was hurler of the year in  and followed suit this season. He registered - against Lavey, including the goal that broke them. In the final, it was Bradley who would pop up to win possession after a Kevin Lynchs score. Ballycran didnt play a sweeper against Dunloy but when McShane dropped Bradley back there for the final, his aerial ability and positional sense set them up. Then, of course, there was his monster score to cement his sides early control. [th All-Star and Hurler of the Year]  – Sean Leo McGoldrick A first award for McGoldrick who has been Coleraines ray of light on their march to the All-Ireland semi-final. It took him one game more, but he matched Cormac ODohertys championship tally of -.Ever-accurate from frees, he offered much more and he landed a super point from out on the wing against Newry Shamrocks in the Ulster final after he had his initial shot blocked. Thats the natural instinct he brings. [st All-Star]  – Cormac ODoherty Still only , the Emmets wizard picks up a fth award. By his own standards, he was quiet in the Ulster final but scored the penalty he won himself. His duck that allowed Gerald Bradley to float over the wonder point highlighted his awareness. He scored - as they downed Kevin Lynchs but its the overall link play that sets him apart. He floats between wing and centre forward, while also popping up behind midfield. [th All-Star]  – Brendan Rogers While making his name as a blistering inside forward, this years campaign saw him play on the wing. It forced teams to reshuffle their plans. He was a puck-out target but still ghosted into scoring positions. His side looked in dire straits in the county final before Rogers manoeuvred his way past the converging Kevin Lynchs defence to land the crucial goal. Pulled a save out of Ryan Elliott in the Ulster final and took Kevin Molloy for three points. [th All-Star]  – Niall Ferris Ferry has already picked up three junior football awards in the colours of Drum. He scored in every league game to help Kevin Lynchs into the top two and clinch a semi-final spot.They were pushed to the pin of their collar against Ballinascreen but Ferris weighed in with -. His goal was fortunate but his positioning was perfect to capitalise on an error by Sean McBride to clinched the game. One of two players to score from play off Karl McKaigue. [nd All-Star]  – Tiarnaacuten McHugh McHugh had an impressive  championship. Derry manager John McEvoy liked what he saw and called the youngster into his plans. He led the Kevin Lynchs attack once again and in the final against Slaughtneil he tormented Sean Cassidy with his uncanny knack of winning possession. When Mark Craigs high ball landed in the square, his presence was enough to put off Morgan McEldowney. After half-time he crashed the sliotar to the net to put the Lynchs in the box seat. [st All-Star]  – Jerome McGuigan Michael McShane has a track record of putting his faith in newcomers and McGuigan paid him back with - from play across four championship games. Scored four times against Lavey to nail down his spot for their pressure-cooker final against Kevin Lynchs. Massive in stature but still has a deft first touch. He gave Dunloy a dferent dimension to consider and allowed the Emmets to build a dferent shape to their attack with Rogers at wing-forward. Edges out Banaghers Tiarnaacuten McCloskey.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The action is also being taken over concerns about staffing levels within the health care sector.Yesterday saw the first occasion in more than a century that nurses represented by the Royal College of Nursing took strike action.Under legislation, there will have to be an Assembly election called heredevolution is not restored by  January. The power- sharing government led by the DUP and Sinn Fein collapsed almost three years ago in January . Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Julian Smith, has stated that with the health service in crisis local political leaders must find a way to restore the Assembly. The Irish Government has also pledged to work “night and day” in a bid to make Stormont al again. Tanaiste Simon Coveney said there was no intention of “bouncing” the Northern Ireland parties back into government, adding they had been discussing the same issues for many months now. This is not about trying to force the parties into a space they dont want to move into. But weve had a reality check with the nurses strike, and I think its a reminder to everyone that now is the time to get this done, he said. The negotiations are also expected to move into round table discussions with Julian Smith and Simon Coveney later this week.PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne has also added his voice to the ongoing talks by urging politicians to find an agreed way to deal with the legacy of the Troubles and he also called for parties to back his calls to employ more police officers.Meanwhile, newly-elected Foyle MP, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, contended last week’s General Election results illustrated people were “sick of the Stormont standoff.”Mr Eastwood also called on both the Irish and British Governments to publish a document showing what had been agreed so far.He added: “The scale of the challenge we face is immense. Our Health Service is in crisis - waiting lists are spiralling out of control and hardworking healthcare staff demand and deserve pay parity with their counterparts across these islands. Our schools are on the verge of a full-blown resource catastropheurgent action isn’t taken. And critical investment across the North is being delayed by a failure of political leadership. It has to stop now.“The SDLP has made bold proposals that are uncomfortable for us but are in the interests of restoring government to meet the needs of patients, pupils and healthcare workers. We will continue to stretch ourselves but it is for the DUP and Sinn Feacutein to set aside their dispute and act, at last, in the interests of the people we all represent,” he added.Sinn Fein vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, claimed Mr Smith refused to meet the five main parties on the issue of the health strike.Ms O’Neill said: “There is a consensus among party leaders that a resolution can be found by the British Secretary of State Julian Smith and civil servants.“The pay and staffing issue must not be used as a political football within the talks. Party leaders restated there is consensusthe Executive is restored by January  that we will adopt a policy towards pay parity.“On that basis we invited the Secretary of State to come and meet with the five party leaders, where he would provide a commitment to deliver this in the event of no agreement by that date. Regrettably he refused to meet the leaders.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The competition aims to encourage interest in Mandarin Chinese language and Chinas culture, with Mandarin ranked as one of the most vital languages to the UK over the next twenty years.This is the third year the competition has taken place in the North and saw entrants from both groups and iniduals, with abilities ranging from beginner to advanced. Speaking at the competition was Jonathan Stewart, director, British Council Northern Ireland.“Congratulations to all of the pupils from Lumen Christi College who took to the stage today speaking in Mandarin. “Like last year, the standards during today’s heat were very high and we hope again to see some of the students in London for the UK final. This competition allows pupils to demonstrate the hard work and effort they have put into learning Mandarin. It’s really important that more young people have the chance to learn languages such as Mandarin, which provides an important insight into dferent ways of thinking and living. Languages open up exciting study, travel and work opportunities in our increasingly interconnected world.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The competition aims to encourage interest in Mandarin Chinese language and Chinas culture, with Mandarin ranked as one of the most vital languages to the UK over the next twenty years.This is the third year the competition has taken place in the North and saw entrants from both groups and iniduals, with abilities ranging from beginner to advanced. Speaking at the competition was Jonathan Stewart, director, British Council Northern Ireland.“Congratulations to all of the pupils from Lumen Christi College who took to the stage today speaking in Mandarin. “Like last year, the standards during today’s heat were very high and we hope again to see some of the students in London for the UK final. This competition allows pupils to demonstrate the hard work and effort they have put into learning Mandarin. It’s really important that more young people have the chance to learn languages such as Mandarin, which provides an important insight into dferent ways of thinking and living. Languages open up exciting study, travel and work opportunities in our increasingly interconnected world.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said:“Paddy Nixon has led Ulster University during a challenging time for the organisation and for higher education in Northern Ireland. I have found him to be an engaged and passionate advocate for university education and for Derry over the last five years.

This is a political priority for me, for the SDLP and it is an economic priority for this city. It is a key ask for us in the current talks.  “We need to call time on the needless export of talented young people from Derry and the North West. We need to provide them with an opportunity to fulfil their ambitions and build a le for themselves in our community. To do that, we need power sharing institutions at Stormont and Ministerial sign off on this critical project. The time for failure is over.

Mathew won the fight by unanimous decision to claim the belt with a dominant  round performance.Coach Ciaran Mc Fadden was delighted but not surprised:“Matthew is probably the UKs most active fighter with  MMA fights this year,” he said. “From the bottom of the card first fight to the headlining main event inside  year is a fantastic effort. I have been training Matthew about  or  years and its unreal what hes achieved in that time frame, the future is bright.Kombat also had another local fighter on the card - James Slavin - who was unlucky after a hard fought fight, and some good show of his skills on the feet losing the match ultimately to Aaron Daniel from Sbg.More recently, Dylan Howell and James Slavin from Kombat recently competed in a K Kickboxing show Fightclub Circus  in Armagh.Dylan won his contest with a first round knock-out in  seconds while James won a unanimous decision after  rounds of action, a brilliant effort from both.Overall Kombat Jiu jitsu have collected  x MMA titles this year and  x K kickboxing Irish Title.

Inver College, Monaghan -  The boys of Lumen Christi College are the champions of Ulster.The Derry school yesterday won the prestigious Nannery Cup after a deserved victory over Inver College from County Monaghan at the Tyrone GAA Centre of Excellence in Garvaghy.It is only the second time in its history that the local school has won the competition which is for pupils in the Under . age bracket.Lumen Christi went into yesterday’s game as favourites having performed strongly throughout the competition.However, they were well aware that Inver College were not to be taken lightly.The game was played in terrible conditions.A strong and freezing wind combined with constant rain to make it very dficult for any decent football to be played.However, to their credit, both sets of players did their best to put on an entertaining contest for the large crowd of supporters from both schools.With the wind behind their backs, it was Inver College who started the game more positively.The Monaghan side scored two points in the opening ten minutes.Despite playing into the strong wind, Lumen refused to lie down and took the game to their opponents.However, clear cut chances were at a premium as the game often got bogged down around the midfield area as players were hesitant to kick it long because of the windy conditions.As the half wore on, Lumen were definitely the stronger side but had yet to convert that supremacy into scores.However, shortly before the half time break, they got the breakthrough that they deserved.After some neat passing in the half forward line, midfielder Flionn McLaughlin broke through the Inver full back line and smashed the ball into the net, leaving the half-time score at - to - in favour of the Derry team.As the second half got underway, Lumen would have been hoping to take advantage of the wind and they quickly went about doing to.Two points from Cathal Deery opened up a three-point gap and it looked like Lumen were getting ready to finish off their opponents.However, the game then swung on a pivotal moment.Inver were awarded a penalty after a foul in the Lumen box.If the score was converted, it would have made the game all-square heading into the final quarter.However, the Inver player crashed his shot off the post.The miss clearly rattled the Inver players while also giving a boost to Lumen.The next score was crucial, and it soon arrived in Lumen’s favour through another well-taken goal from Flionn McLaughlin.His fellow midfielder Eoin Canavan then got in on the act, scoring a goal and a point to open up a comfortable lead for Lumen.Inver, to their credit, never gave up and continued battling as the game neared an end.However, they were unable to register any more scores and would probably accept that they were simply beaten by a better team on the day. googletag.cmd.push Lumen Christi College – Tomas O’Boyle Joshua Doherty, Odhran Campbell, Adam Devine Luke Harkin, Cillian Doherty, James Conlon Eoin Canavan, Flionn McLaughlin Cathal Deery, Mark Chester, Ethan McClelland Evan O’Neill, Niall Brolly, Cal O’Reilly.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county.

Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

He said he listened on the doorsteps about the importance of preserving the Union which had been ldquodegraded and downgraded by Boris Johnston.He then said what he thought of the prime minister. ldquoHersquos the sort of man who would take your Alsatian dog for a walk and hersquod come back an hour later and give you a Chihuahua and say it was alright.ldquoSo we need to convince Boris Johnston of the importance of the union, and that we the DUP, even though our numbers are lower, that its very important that we work to the union for those who live in Leicester, London, Manchester or wherever  in the United Kingdom, is the same for the people of Strangford.Later, he admitted he had estimated that his vote would have been lower.He said: ldquoI had already made my prediction [before the nightrsquos result] and it was slightly below what I got, but I knew there would be a big dference as the vote was exceptional the last time and something I never expected.Once again Mr Shannonrsquos nearest rival was Alliance candidate Kellie Armstrong.

He has said before that he doesnrsquot have the authority, yet he made the last offer.She stressed that none of the union members wanted to take strike action but felt compelled to do so as a last resort.Speaking as her union entered the fourth week of industrial action, she said: ldquoThe fact that Unison, RCN, Unite and NIPSA are all taking strike action today reinforces the fact that health care staff feel passionately about the preservation of the NHS and want to restore it to a service that they can be proud of again and will last for generations to come.ldquoAgain we ask the public to support us as they have previously and join us in the fight to restore our health service to a high standard.She called on recently elected MPs to fulfil their promises of support at last weekrsquos strike and added: ldquoWe look to our local MLAs, Department of Health officials and the Secretary of State to address these issues now.She said that Unison would like to thank local businesses which provided the striking staff with food and refreshments during this time, in particular Molloyrsquos in Downpatrick  A in Crossgar, and Down Community Health Committee members for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sinn.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein\u0027s candidate sails home on night of drama at Titanic Centre  ","story":"THE re-election of Chris Hazzard largely went under the radar at last weekrsquos election count in Belfast.Originally due to take place in Magherafelt, the South Down count was switched to the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast in the shadow of the iconic Harland and Wolff shipyard and its imposing Sampson and Goliath cranes which dominate the city skyline.The mainstream media effectively ignored the South Down contest in the run-up to last weekrsquos election and, during the counting of votes across six constituencies in the huge Titanic centre, it was more of the same.Predictably, the media focus was on the North and South Belfast seats where DUP heavyweights Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost out to Sinn Feinrsquos John Finucane and the SDLPrsquos Claire Hanna respectively.Television cameras were focused on the reaction of the winners and losers in the Belfast constituencies and the arrival of DUP leader Arlene Foster mdash on what was a particularly dficult night for her party mdash and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and the republican partyrsquos northern leader Michelle OrsquoNeill.Mr Hazzard, who made history two years ago when he broke the SDLPrsquos -year stranglehold on the South Down seat, was officially declared the winner shortly before .am, but his acceptance speech was brief. As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for. However, Mrs Macauley provided it with a glimmer of hope with her performanceAontuacute mdash which was contesting its first election mdash polled , votes but party candidate, Paul Brady, wasnrsquot at the count centre in Belfast where party leader Peader Tobin did call late on Thursday evening.As the last of the media interviews were conducted, television and radio sound engineers were doing their best to drown out the clatter of chairs being piled on top of one another and folding tables used by counting staff collapsed to be packed away.The last of the candidates, party supporters, election staff and the media started to drt away from the Titanic Exhibition Centre around .am, following another night of high drama which signicantly reshaped the provincersquos political landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special gift for Lorcán  ","story":"CHRISTMAS came early for Downpatrick toddler Lorcaacuten Maguire who received his first dose of le-extending medication yesterday.His parents have been campaigning to get the expensive drug Orkambi free on the NHS since Lorcaacuten, who has Cystic Fibrosis , was just a few months old.Brave Lorcaacuten, who turns three next month, took his drug at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with the help of some strawberry-flavoured milk.However, it was a bittersweet moment for his mother, Jen Banks, as she knows that other parents of children are still patiently waiting for the drug to became available.She said: ldquoLast Christmas I was dreaming about getting Orkambi but it was a dream that would have meant leaving my home, family, and our amazing NHS to move to the south.ldquoThis year on Christmas morning Lorcaacuten will open his stocking and before he opens the rest of his presents, he will have his morning dose of Orkambi with a few segments of chocolate orange. I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

and he said there are \"issues around how that would be exercised\".He added: \"We do want the Assembly to have a say, but we want to ensure that say can be exercised in a fair manner that respects the principle of consent as set out in the Belfast Agreement.\"On customs arrangements, Sir Jeffrey said \"it is clear that those checks will take place\".Sir Jeffrey concluded that the DUP would \"like to be in a position to support\" the PMs deal, but \"such is the gravity of our concern\", they cannot in its present state.Also making his maiden speech, Alliance MP Stephen Farryurged Mr Johnson to be a Prime Minister \"for all four nations of the UK\".Beginning with a few words in Irish, Mr Farry said he comes to the House \"as someone with a very strong mandate for Remain\", and as such he will vote against the Withdrawal Agreement Bill \"to honour the wishes of those who sent me here\".Mr Farry said there is \"no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit\", and added that while the previous Brexit deal \"had the pragmatic support of the Northern Ireland business community\", Mr Johnsons agreement is \"a much more challenging situation for Northern Ireland\" with proposed checks in the Irish Sea.He added: \"The UK is about four dferent nations, so my appeal to the Prime Minister is dont be a one-nation Prime Minister for England, be a Prime Minister for all four nations of the UK, and in particular as we proceed into more detailed scrutiny of this Bill, to pay very particular attention to the needs of Northern Ireland and the damaging implications of whats now set to emerge in terms of that interface down the Irish Sea.\"Mr Farry also paid tribute to his predecessor Lady Sylvia Hermon for \"standing up for Northern Ireland, and in particular for protecting the Good Friday Agreement in the context of Brexit\".try catch  TrendingMan dies after serious two vehicle collision -

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
