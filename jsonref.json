place for women to laugh, cry and cook together\u0027.Ms Mekonnen – who has her aunt, one of the cooks Hiwot Dagnachew, to thank for her family surviving the tragedy, has told the Telegraph: \u0027We

The Duchess of Sussex cooks with women in the Hubb Community Kitchen in West London\u0027My aunt was trying to be calm but she was clearly panicking. She said there were flames outside her window and that we should get out.\u0027            Ms Mahmud made her way down the stairs to the bottom of the tower to safety  last yearShe told how she put on her dressing gown, grabbed her children, trying to keep them \u0027calm\u0027 whilst in \u0027complete shock\u0027 and ran out into the corridor.She told how it was \u0027hard to breathe\u0027, as she held Liva, five, under one arm and held Yohana\u0027s hand and descended the stairs, while they were \u0027coughing and the kids were screaming\u0027.People were getting \u0027really, really scared\u0027 and \u0027running back up the stairs\u0027, leaving her \u0027tempted to go back but, I just couldn\u0027t see myself being locked in the flat on the 19th floor with that fire, so I carried on.

The moment I started cooking I was in tears. I didn\u0027t know why though. I was just excited to be back in the kitchen again.\u0027Word started to spread - the mums from my son\u0027s school came along and they told their friends, too. Soon there were women from different cultures all cooking, swapping recipes, talking and laughing together.\u0027She told how Meghan - photographed on the book\u0027s front cover helping out - had been happy to pitch in, continuing: \u0027She wore an apron.

But I always want to see the best candidate selected. That’s what members rightly decided last night.’ But who is Dave Sharma?Who is Dave Sharma?Born Devanand Sharma in Vancouver, Canada in 1975, more commonly known as Dave, his family moved to Parramatta in Sydney a few years later, he revealed in an interview with The Indian Herald back in 2013, when he was appointed as Australia’s youngest Ambassador of Indian heritage at age 37.Sharma said that his grandfather was a Brahmin priest from the Uttar Pradesh region of India who moved to Trinidad in 1908. ‘My father was the youngest of 9 children. My father was born in 1928 in Trinidad and currently lives in Sydney. He however spends time between Trinidad, Australia and Canada.’Dave continued to explain that his ‘father did a Law Degree and he married my mother Diana who was from Sydney in 1964. They met each other in Kings College in University of London, where both of them were studying.’He also said that while a lot of his father’s family went into law, Dave was the first to embark on a career in foreign service. Studying at Turramurra High School, he achieved the highest HSC Tertiary rank of 100 in the entire state of NSW, also being the highest ranked student in NSW Public Schools that year.After studying law at the University of Cambridge, Dave went back to school to study medicine at the University of Sydney before topping it up with a Masters in International Relations from Deakin University.Before becoming Australia’s Ambassador to Israel, Dave served in the Australian diplomatic offices as Counsellor at the Australian Embassy, Third Secretary at the Australian High Commission and as Senior Civilian Adviser with the Peace Monitoring Group.Dave was also an Adviser to Foreign Minister Alexander Downer from 2004 to 2006 and was a Senior Career Officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), as well Assistant Secretary in the Africa Branch and Acting First Assistant Secretary in the International Division in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.          Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Liberal Party candidate for Wentworth Dave SharmaFollowing his appointment by Foreign Minister Bob Carr, Dave said that becoming the Ambassador of Israel was a ‘high profile posting as Israel is such an important part of the world for us. We also have a big Jewish community in Australia and have taken a close interest in this relationship.‘Indian community is a very successful migrant community in Australia and instead of concentrating on a few professions they should adopt alternate professions as well like Public Policy and join Government at the Federal level and expand their presence in non-traditional areas.‘Australia is a very open society and there are positions available for all Australians. There is meritocracy and hard work in Australia is recognised.’ He moved to Israel with his wife Rachel and their three daughters in 2013.Dave Sharma Liberal CandidateMalcolm Turnbull’s choice for his Liberal candidate won over the new Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s pick, despite calls for a woman to take up the vacant seat in Wentworth. Last week, Dave Sharman beat seven other candidates in the running for the blue ribbon electorate.Sharma will now face a by-election battle on October 20, but early polls indicate that there will be a big swing against the Liberals, who have never lost Wentworth, which includes Australia\u0027s most expensive suburbs of Point Piper and Vaucluse.This came after Morrison had already had an embarrassing episode earlier on in the day, having posted a video of Question Time edited together with Fatman Scoop’s song Be Faithful, with the caption: ‘QT was on fire today. Good work, team.’Of course, the tweet was savaged online for the song\u0027s inappropriate lyrics (\u0027who f***ing tonight?\u0027), the allusion to Liberal party member\u0027s wealth (if you\u0027ve got a hundred dollar bill put your hands up) and the possible illegality of using parliamentary footage as promotional content.Morrison removed the post hours later and apologised for using a song that’s lyrical content was \u0027not okay\u0027. In addition to this, Turnbull had been accused of attempting to tear the party that had sacked him apart.Morrison\u0027s preferred candidate Katherine O\u0027Regan, a former deputy mayor of Woollahra, received just 19 votes out of 201 in the first round and came fifth out of eight candidates, despite being the frontrunner. The other women in the preselection race: Mary-Lou Jarvis, another Woollahra councillor and rheumatologist Maxine Szramka also fared poorly against the male contenders.          Mary-Lou Jarvis (R) is seen at the Liberal Party pre-selection meeting for the seat of WentworthTo make matters worse, Mr Morrison misspelled his name as David on Twitter, despite his name being Devanand. \u0027Big congratulations to David Sharma, our new Liberal candidate for Wentworth,\u0027 he tweeted before deleting the social media message.However, Dave Sharma also received backlash after an opinion he penned for The Age in June emerged, resulting in many social media users slamming the candidate for his views. In the piece, Sharma wrote: \u0027Most school assets - the buildings and infrastructure - are used only during school hours, or roughly 15 per cent of the time. School employees and teachers are similarly underemployed, working hours closer to three-quarters of a regular full-time job.\u0027We expect government services to adapt to the tempos and demands of modern life, yet the school system remains stubbornly resistant to even the contemplation of change.\u0027And in an economy which demands increasingly high levels of skill and education, if we are to maintain our standards of living and way of life, perhaps some of the answer lies simply in more hours of education and learning.\u0027Emmy winners 2018: All the British actors who picked up Emmy AwardsMarc Benioff net worth revealed as he buys Time Magazine Emmys 2018: How to watch the awards onlineWho is Fan Bingbing?

Soon-Yi Previn and Woody Allen at a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden in 2006When she got home, Allen looked at her ankle and suggested she see a doctor.After this incident, the pair began going to Knicks games together.When they began their \u0027fling,\u0027 both planned to keep it a secret and neither thought it would last.\u0027It only became a relationship really when we were thrown together because of the molestation charge,\u0027 Previn said.The comment refers to Dylan Farrow\u0027s allegations that Allen abused her in 1992 when she was seven-years-old.Allen was investigated but wasn\u0027t charged, and he has long denied inappropriately touching his adopted daughter.He faced a wave of backlash earlier this year including several prominent actors vowing not to work with him again.In a statement in January after Dylan\u0027s allegations resurfaced, Allen reiterated his denial and accused her and her family of using the Time\u0027s Up movement \u0027to repeat this discredited allegation.\u0027          Previn (pictured right, with Allen, Mia Farrow and their children in 1986) said she fell in love in 1992 with Allen, who was Farrow\u0027s boyfriend at the timeThe director is also quoted in the New York piece.\u0027I am a pariah,\u0027 he said during a lunch with the author.\u0027People think that I was Soon-Yi\u0027s father, that I raped and married my underaged, retarded daughter.\u0027He adds: \u0027We weren\u0027t thinking, My God, let\u0027s get married.\u0027Our relationship deepened as we went through the barrage of terrible accusations, and the paparazzi forced us to take walks only on my penthouse roof.\u0027Previn told the magazine that she decided to speak out now because Dylan Farrow, is, in her view, unfairly accusing her husband of sexual abusing her when she was a child.\u0027I was never interested in writing a `Mommie Dearest,\u0027 getting even with Mia - none of that,\u0027 Previn told the magazine.    Previn (pictured with Allen in 2010) said she decided to speak out now because Dylan Farrow, is, in her view, unfairly accusing her husband of sexual abusing her when she was a child\u0027But what\u0027s happened to Woody is so upsetting, so unjust. (Mia) has taken advantage of the #MeToo movement and paraded Dylan as a victim. And a whole new generation is hearing about it when they shouldn\u0027t.\u0027Previn also said she and her mother clashed soon after Farrow adopted her and that her mother many times treated her like a maid.She also said of Farrow: \u0027Mia wasn\u0027t maternal to me from the get-go.\u0027An email sent to Mia Farrow\u0027s agent Sunday night was not immediately returned.In separate statements posted on Twitter on Sunday night, Dylan Farrow and Ronan Farrow say their mother is a good parent and that the New York magazine article is inaccurate and unfair.Dylan also noted that the New York magazine piece\u0027s author, Daphne Merkin, calls herself a longtime friend of Allen\u0027s."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/21/505004C100000578-0-image-a-47_1537215988930.jpg","title":"National Cheeseburger Day 2018 McDonalds Wendys away free cheeseburgers","story":"When is National Cheeseburger Day 2018?National Cheeseburger Day 2018 will take place on Tuesday, September 18.What is National Cheeseburger Day?National Cheeseburger Day is the ‘celebration of one of the most iconic and delicious foods of the USA,’ according to Days of the Year.On this day, many fast-food establishments such as Wendy’s and McDonald’s celebrate the day by giving out free cheeseburgers.The very first cheeseburger is thought to have been made at a Los Angeles diner, O’Dells, which had it on the menu, served with cheese and chili for 25 cents.

Until the United Scrap Lead Co. began crushing lead batteries and dumping it on 32,000 cubic yards on the land from 1948 to 1980. Eventually battery acid and rinse water contaminated water wells nearby causing the Environmental Protection Agency to declare it among the 400 highly hazardous toxic waste locations found in the country. Award-winning photographer David T. Hanson captured the image above showing the shocking site in 1985           Hanson traveled to 67 of those toxic sites in 45 states taking aerial photographs while on a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship in 1985. Now, 33 years later Hanson is publishing a book titled Waste Land that showcases the shocking, yet captivating photographs he captured of ‘nineteenth-century mines, smelters, and wood-processing plants to landfills and illicit dumps, large petrochemical complexes, aerospace water-contamination sites, nuclear weapons plants, and nerve gas disposal areas,’ he explained to DailyMail.com. Pictured above is an image Hanson captured showing six acres next to the Delaware River in Philadelphia that was formerly the Metal Banks Site that processed transformers and oil           Hanson, who has had his work exhibited in numerous museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago, noted that he selected sites that ‘represented the broad spectrum of industries that have transformed our landscape over the past 150 years.’ Pictured above is a photo captured by Hanson showing Leadville, Colorado called the California Gulch that has been seriously impacted by lead, silver, zinc, copper, and gold mining activities          Hanson captured the image above showing one of three areas in Renton, Washington that was the proposed commercial and residential development known as Port Quendall in 1985. The area was previously an old Reilly Tar \u0026amp Chemical Co. Refinery established in the early 1900s to receive coal gas residues from the old Seattle Gas Co. plant on Lake Union. It closed in 1970 and during the investigation into the soil in 1983, it was found to contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in concentrations up to 4.8 percent - which is why it was declared toxic by the EPA          Hanson said: ‘I also thought that it was important to include a variety of sites in terms of the visibility of their environmental hazards, from dramatic mine tailings and waste ponds to sites where the hazards were invisible or concealed beneath vast industrial complexes.’ Pictured above is a photo captured by Hanson showing Anaconda, Montana with copper smelter covering 5,000 acres of land thanks to the Anaconda Co. Smelter which operated from the late 1800s to 1980           The image above that Hanson captured shows 15 acres of contaminated land in Crosby, Texas that was formerly The French Ltd. site that contains heavy metals, phenols, oil, grease, acids and solvents. The area is in the floodplain of the San Jacinto River and has been flooded on several occasions  ‘…In photographing the sites (and in my selection of the one photograph that would represent each site), I tried to utilize a range of pictorial approaches to the representation of toxic waste sites—from dramatic abstractions to mundane industrial sites, from banal commercial real estate to purely entropic landscapes.‘I was particularly interested in the possibilities of investigating abstraction and the social realities that Modernist abstraction repressed.’While traveling for a year to the Superfund hazardous waste sites, Hanson said that he was completely ‘stunned’ by the ‘enormous environmental devastation’ that he witnessed across the country.‘I quickly realized how much more visible and dramatic the destruction was from an airplane. From a highway one couldn’t see industrial waste ponds, hidden from public view, leaking in to local streams and rivers,’ he explained.‘From a country road one couldn’t know that a dirt road in the woods led to a midnight dumping site where companies were illegally dumping toxic waste in a backwoods bayou. Seeing the extent of our environmental destruction, day after day, was a very disturbing experience for me.‘I felt like I was working in a war zone.’          Pictured above is the community of Times Beach, Missouri in 1985. According to Hanson\u0027s book, \u0027in 1972 and again in 1973, the city contracted with a waste oil hauler to spray oil on unpaved roads for dust control. It was later learned that the waste oil contained dioxin. In November and early December 1982, EPA sampled the roads and right-of-ways in Times Beach. Soon afterward, the Meramec River flooded the city. EPA expedited the sample analyses and found dioxin at levels from less than 1 part per billion (ppb) to 127 ppb\u0027          While traveling for a year to the Superfund hazardous waste sites, Hanson said that he was completely ‘stunned’ by the ‘enormous environmental devastation’ that he witnessed across the country. Pictured above is Aspen, Colorado where old silver and lead mines were once active from 1879 to 1920. Little mining is conducted now, but the primary concern is the exposure to toxic metals contained in mine wastes, mill tailings and smelter by-products, according to Hanson\u0027s book Hanson decided that after witnessing and photographing the hazardous waste sites that he became involved in ‘creating more public awareness of these issues.’The Stanford University graduate has used his work for decades to promote environmental reform which helped lead the efforts for voters in the state of Montana to pass #I-137 in November 1998 which banned cyanide process open-pit gold and silver mining. It is still the only state in the country to prohibit cyanide heap-leach mining.Hanson also added that of the 67 sites he photographed in 1985 -1986, very few have been removed from the EPA’s Superfund list.‘Since 1980, only a small percentage of the total number of sites have been removed from Superfund, while most remain essentially unchanged, pending litigation, funding or environmental studies regarding feasible solutions,’ he explained.‘In reality none of these places will ever be fully reclaimed or returned to their original condition. Their “cleanup” merely amounts to emergency removal, stabilization, and long-term containment. Often the “cleanup” entails writing off the primary ecological problems as either insoluble or too expensive to consider.‘Many sites present problems for which there are no known solutions others will require years of complex remedial investigations and feasibility studies. A substantial number of sites for which solutions have been determined remain virtually untouched, awaiting the allocation of necessary clean-up funds.‘Many of the iniduals and companies responsible for the contamination have used bankruptcy laws or a variety of other legal maneuvers to avoid paying for the cleanup, thus shifting the financial burden to the American taxpayer.’     Hanson decided that after witnessing and photographing the hazardous waste sites that he became involved in ‘creating more public awareness of these issues.’ Pictured above is a portion of the 27.2-acre hazardous site in Bridgeport, New Jersey where the Bridgeport Rental \u0026amp Oil Services operated from 1969 to 1980. The site holds more than 80 tanks and process vessels, drums, tank trucks and an 11.8-acre unlined lagoon that has 50million gallons of oil, oil-water emulsions, sludge and contaminated water          Pictured above is East Helena, Montana where the Asarco primary lead and zinc smelter has emitted particulates containing metals into the air throughout its history. Hanson also added that of the 67 sites he photographed in 1985 -1986, very few have been removed from the EPA’s Superfund list.          Hanson said: ‘Since 1980, only a small percentage of the total number of sites have been removed from Superfund, while most remain essentially unchanged, pending litigation, funding or environmental studies regarding feasible solutions,’ he explained. In reality none of these places will ever be fully reclaimed or returned to their original condition. Their “cleanup” merely amounts to emergency removal, stabilization, and long-term containment. Often the “cleanup” entails writing off the primary ecological problems as either insoluble or too expensive to consider.\u0027 Pictured above is six acres in Utica, Michigan where the site contains an incinerator for liquid wastes, various industrial liquids and sludges in two lagoonsHanson said the problems are ‘getting worse’ and the ‘EPA is increasing relaxing its regulations on industrial pollution.’He also added that he has ‘grave concerns about the substantive cleanup of Superfund sites as well as the other toxic sites’ across the country. As an example, Hanson explained that what he considers the most dangerous Superfund site, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Rocky Flats Plant near Denver in Golden, Colorado, ‘manufactured the plutonium cores for the nuclear and thermonuclear weapons produced in the United States.’‘In 1996 the DOE estimated that the total cleanup costs for Rocky Flats would be $100 billion. Yet in 2005 the DOE declared that it had completed the cleanup of Rocky Flats for a cost of only $7 billion (although the industrial core of Rocky Flats remains a high-security site whose extensive environmental hazards have not yet been addressed),’ he explained.‘5,600 acres surrounding the weapons plants had been established in 2001 as the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, to be managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in spite of the fact that this land had been heavily contaminated with plutonium over the course of forty years from extensive dumping and more than 200 plutonium fires at the plant.            Hanson said the problems are ‘getting worse’ and the ‘EPA is increasing relaxing its regulations on industrial pollution.’ Pictured above is the Pocatello, Idaho where Hanson photographed the Union Pacific Railroad Co. site where sludge from its oilwater separation plant was dumped into what appears to be a 150-foot by 40-foot unlined man-made pond           Pictured above in the image Hanson captured is Fresno County, California where the Atlas Asbestos Mine operated from 1963 to 1980 on a 16-acre site about 19miles northwest of Coalingo. The abandoned site consists of the asbestos mine, a processing mill, support buildings, and extensive asbestos tailings. Drainage from the site is directly downslope into White Creek, then into Los Gatos Creek. Los Gatos Creek is a tributary to the Arroyo Pasajero, a flood area along the California Aqueduct, according to Hanson\u0027s book           Pictured above in the image Hanson captured is the Martin-Marietta Aluminum Co. produces aluminum on a site covering less than 350 acres in The Dalles, Wasco County, Oregon. Cyanide is present in both the shallow and deep aquifers underlying the site, according to tests conducted by the State and Martin-Marietta. Cyanide appeared in one production well and several monitoring wells, and also in surface run-off and in leachate from a cathode waste pile, according to Hanson\u0027s book           Pictured above is Scotlandville, Louisiana where 55 acres of land was used by the Petro-Processors. It was found by the EPA that toxic organic compounds and heavy metals had been released into local waterways, eventually finding their way to the Mississippi River, and were posing a threat to an underground drinking water supply, according to Hanson\u0027s book‘In 1975-76 a DOE contractor had found 100 billion particles of plutonium per acre on the land that is now a “wildlife refuge” and is currently about to be opened to the public.’He added that plutonium is radioactive and highly flammable and that believes it to be one of the most toxic substances produced by humans.Though the images in Hanson’s book were captured 33 years ago, they are even more relevant today ‘given our growing concerns about energy production, environmental degradation, and climate change—and given the current Administration’s broad dismantling of the Environmental Protection Agency, environmental regulations, and Superfund,’ he noted.His book can be purchased beginning September 25 and can be found here.

To lose it would be a calamity - and a betrayal by our ministers Commentary by Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail The idea that a firm as prestigious and influential as Unilever, with a British heritage dating back to its foundation at Port Sunlight on the Wirral in the late 19th century, should be proposing to leave these shores is a terrible shock.Unilever is as British as Marmite – one of its big-name products – and 60 per cent of its annual sales of £54billion originate from the UK.The prospect of the giant moving out of the City became a reality last week when a 200-page prospectus, filled with complex technical detail and legalese, was delivered to investors who will vote on the issue at the end of next month.          Unilever is as British as Marmite – one of its big-name products – and 60 per cent of its annual sales of £54billion originate from the UKIf the Anglo-Dutch behemoth were to leave this country, it would have to quit the FTSE 100 index and, as a result, many of the big pension funds and insurers that look after the retirement funds of every pensioner and future retiree in Britain would be precluded from owning shares in one of our best-managed and most ethical and environmentally-conscious companies.The rules of many UK pension funds require that they only invest in UK-quoted companies for reasons of prudence, accountability and governance.Not surprisingly, one of the country’s biggest investors, the insurer Aviva, is rightly crying foul over the idea of Unilever’s move – arguing that the firm would no longer be a British company.Aviva’s chief investment officer, David Cumming, told the Financial Times: ‘We are not supportive and will vote against it. It doesn’t add any value for us and we lose quite a large company from the index. We don’t see any justification for the move.’          The prospect of the giant moving out of the City became a reality last week when a 200-page prospectus, filled with complex technical detail and legalese, was delivered to investors who will vote on the issue at the end of next monthThe reason Unilever wants to rebase in the Netherlands is founded on its bruising experience last year when it was subject of a £110billion takeover bid, which ultimately failed.In what would have been the second largest corporate deal in history, US giant Kraft Heinz (backed by private equity firms and the support one of the world’s richest men, Warren Buffett) launched an unsolicited bid for the maker of countless household names such as Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.Unilever’s Dutch chief executive, Paul Polman, a staunch advocate of ethical capitalism, fought off the bid and vowed to protect Unilever’s golden heritage from predators.To try to guarantee this and prevent any future raids, it was felt that the firm’s Anglo-Dutch structure, with share quotations, boards and headquarters in both Britain and Holland, should be simplified. This, management feels, is best achieved by a switch to Rotterdam.          If the Anglo-Dutch behemoth were to leave this country, it would have to quit the FTSE 100 index and, as a result, many of the big pension funds and insurers that look after the retirement funds of every pensioner and future retiree in Britain would be precluded from owning shares in one of our best-managed and most ethical and environmentally-conscious companiesThe intention is that Unilever will follow Royal Dutch Shell and the publishing and media colossus Reed Elsevier (now renamed Relx) which both separately decided to unify their shares under one umbrella while keeping share quotations in London as part of the FTSE 100 index.But Unilever wants to go one step further by coming out of the FTSE 100, claiming that it has more major Dutch than British investors. The truth is that the British Establishment’s reaction has been pathetic.It has shown monumental weakness and done nothing to ensure that Unilever stays here, while the Dutch government has done all in its power to encourage the move.A juicy carrot offered to Unilever chiefs by the Netherlands is the abolition of a measure that forces companies to pay the tax on idends distributed to shareholders upfront. This brings the Dutch system into line with the UK, which did the same several years ago as part of a successful effort to simplify our tax structure and make Britain the most attractive location for inward investment from overseas in Europe.          Prince Harry with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (right) and Paul Polman (left), CEO of Unilever backstage at the Atlantic Council\u0027s Annual Awards Dinner Honoring HRH Prince Harry at Ritz Carlton Hotel in Washington, DCThis tax change may have been the decisive factor for a Dutch-dominated board of directors. But there can be no doubt that their planned move to Rotterdam has been influenced by the Government’s woeful recent record at defending British companies against foreign predators.It’s a tragic truth that Britain has been allowed to become the most open market in the world to overseas takeovers – often with disastrous consequences for our national interests.For example, the £11.5billion takeover of Cadbury by Kraft led to the chocolate giant’s headquarters closing, its tax domicile switching from Britain to low-tax Switzerland and the unpopular meddling with the size, ingredients and taste of emblematic brands, including the Creme Egg.Other leading British brands have also been sold off, such as Costa Coffee being taken over by Coca-Cola, a company that has been heavily criticised for tax avoidance.By contrast, the Dutch authorities are much more protective against foreign takeovers.Last year, the chemical and paint giant Akzo Nobel (the owner of Britain’s Dulux brand) defended itself against a hostile bid by garnering the support of works councils, which have a key role in such takeover talks, as well as using provisions in Dutch competition law. Indeed, there is a clear view among analysts and some shareholders that the real purpose of Unilever’s proposal to move its domicile is to give itself maximum protection from any future bids for the group or attempts to force it to demerge any of its major brands.Aside from any other considerations, I am convinced that the decision to migrate from Britain makes no commercial sense.The fastest growing part of Unilever’s erse business involves beauty brands such as Dove and household products including Persil. There seems to be an insatiable demand for them from emerging economies in Asia and Latin America. The brains behind these best-sellers would remain in the UK because they are expected to make up 75 per cent of global sales, while the teams behind Unilever’s ice cream range Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and lesser products such as Lipton tea will be working in Holland.Whatever the management thinks, the major restructuring decision to separate the share quotation base and domicile from the home of the company’s main business is irrational.Inevitably, too, there are bound to be profound concerns that the Treasury could lose millions of pounds of corporate taxes from Unilever as a result of a switch to Rotterdam.Significantly, Holland has a reputation as a home for tax avoidance, with laws that offer a shield from taxation on profits.Such enticements have lured firms including Starbucks, Google and IBM to set up offices, while the Rolling Stones and U2, too, have taken advantage of Dutch tax shelters.Of course, there has been a widespread suspicion that Unilever’s break from the FTSE 100 is being done as a protective measure in case trading conditions suffer as a result of Brexit.However, my conversations with Unilever executives do not lead me to think this is a major issue, although it may be preying on the minds of Dutch shareholders and bosses driving the process.Even so, I am utterly convinced that if Unilever leaves Britain, the company will do itself great damage.Its shares would be less attractive to both overseas and British investors who value Anglo-Saxon capitalism, the weight of financial expertise in Britain and access to the strongest capital markets in Europe.With Britain’s national interest at stake, is it beyond hope that the Government might finally wake up to the huge potential cost to this country’s economy of what would be a calamitous decision for a company as important as Unilever to move its HQ abroad? "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/14/504C7AA100000578-0-image-a-10_1537191560106.jpg","title":"Older age groups drink way allows carry responsibilities study finds","story":"    Research finds middle-aged Britons care more whether their drinking harms their image than if it is bad for their health.

Social media pictures (above) purportedly showed explosions and rockets in the night sky around Latakia close to where the incident happened          The Russian defence ministry said it held Israel responsible because, at the time of the incident, Israeli fighter jets were mounting air attacks on Syria targets and had only given Moscow one minute\u0027s warning, not enough time for the Russian plane to get to safety. Pictures on social media showed explosions in the area last night          The Il-20 (file picture), a turbo-prop plane used for electronic reconnaissance, was brought down as it came into land at Russia\u0027s Hmeymim air base near LatakiaIsrael\u0027s military later expressed \u0027sorrow\u0027  for the deaths of crew members  but blamed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Iran.\u0027Israel expresses sorrow for the deaths of the aircrew members of the Russian plane that was downed tonight due to Syrian anti-aircraft fire,\u0027 a military statement said in Israel\u0027s first reaction to the incident.\u0027Israel holds the Assad regime, whose military shot down the Russian plane, fully responsible for this incident. Israel also holds Iran and the Hezbollah terror organisation accountable for this unfortunate incident.\u0027 The incident, which happened late on Monday, was the worst case of friendly fire between the two allies since Russia\u0027s game-changing military intervention in September 2015. Earlier, the Russian defence ministry had said that the plane, carrying 14 people, had gone off the radar around 11pm during an attack by four Israeli F-16 jets over Syrian infrastructure in the province of Latakia, a stronghold of President Bashar al-Assad.It happened moments after Turkey and Russia announced a deal that offered millions of people reprieve from a threatened military assault in northern Syria. There was no immediate word from Damascus, but the deadly air war sequence started when missiles struck the coastal region of Latakia on Monday.Israeli pilots carrying out attacks on Syrian targets \u0027used the Russian plane as a cover, exposing it to fire from Syrian air defences,\u0027 the Russian military said.Russian spies \u0027who were planning to HACK into the Swiss lab...Violent clashes break out in Kiev after Ukraine agrees to...Ex-British soldier, 25, who fought with Kurdish militia...Share this article\u002715 Russian servicemen died,\u0027 it said, adding Moscow reserved \u0027the right to proper retaliatory actions\u0027 against Israel.It made no further mention of a French frigate the Russian defence ministry had earlier claimed also opened fire from the area on Monday.The French army had denied any involvement and Syria state media had reported late Monday that air defences had intercepted missiles targeting Latakia.\u0027Our air defences are countering hostile missiles coming from the sea towards the city of Latakia, and a number of them have been intercepted,\u0027 it said, quoting a military source. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, some missiles did get through and struck ammunition depots at the site of the technical industries institute.Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Britain-based monitoring group, said at least two fighters were killed and 10 wounded in the strike.    The Russian reconnaissance plane was brought down by Syrian missiles as it was approaching Hmeymim airbase          Earlier, the Russian defence ministry had said that the plane had gone off the radar around 11pm during an attack by four Israeli F-16 jets over Syrian infrastructure in the province of Latakia, a stronghold of President Bashar al-Assad. Pictures on social media showed explosions in the Latakia area last night\u0027Two bodies were found,\u0027 he told AFP, adding that he could not immediately confirm whether the casualties were soldiers or militiamen from forces supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Israel has conducted frequent raids in recent months against Syria\u0027s military infrastructure, including against bases it believes host Iranian combattants.Earlier in September, Israel admitted carrying out 200 strikes in Syria over the past 18 months.The Syrian blunder came hot on the heels of a major deal announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan after talks in the Russian resort of Sochi.The two main brokers in northern Syria agreed to create a 15-20 kilometre-wide demilitarised zone along the line of contact between rebels and regime troops in the Idlib region.That would be achieved by October 15 and would entail a withdrawal of all jihadist fighters from the area.The demilitarised zone will be secured with the help of \u0027mobile patrol groups of Turkish contingents and contingents of Russian military police,\u0027 Putin said.By the end of the year, transportation routes between the key port of Latakia and Aleppo as well as Latakia and the major city of Hama must be restored, he added. Iran, the third member of the so-called Astana process aimed at ending the seven-year civil war in Syria, praised the deal as an example of \u0027responsible diplomacy.\u0027Three million people reside in the Idlib region, the last significant chunk of Syria still held by rebels and jihadists.The UN had warned that a fully-fledged ground assault aimed at completing Damascus\u0027 military reconquest could spark the worst humanitarian catastrophe yet in a conflict that has killed more 360,000.Observers and residents of the Idlib region were sceptical however of a deal that appeared to be little more than a temporary fix.\u0027This could be a win for diplomacy and that\u0027s what Syria needs more of to solve this crisis,\u0027 said Lorraine Bramwell, Syria country director for International Rescue Committee.\u0027However, we have seen previously how de-escalation deals haven\u0027t lasted long term,\u0027 she added.Hundreds of people gathered in Binnish, a town in the rebel-held province of Binnish, following Monday\u0027s announcement in Sochi.\u0027The demand of the Syrian people, since the very first day, has remained unchanged: it\u0027s the fall of the regime,\u0027 said Wassim Souweid, one of the demonstrators.\u0027I reckon this decision will not stop bombardments on civilians, will not offer any alternative to the people,\u0027 he added."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/05/5055EDA200000578-0-image-m-46_1537245803039.jpg","title":"Hilarious moment golden retriever films inside mouth","story":"    The footage, filmed somewhere in the UK, captures the playful pup as it watches its owner fix his bright red bicycleBut his dog had no interest in the scene before it, and loitered around as it waited for attention.It soon gives up -

For over 90 years, Time has been at the forefront of the most significant events and impactful stories that shape our global conversation.’The publisher of magazines such as People and Better Homes \u0026amp Gardens put four Time Inc. publications up for sale in March, but negotiations for the sale of the three other publications - Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated - are continuing.Before the sale was revealed, Benioff revealed in an interview that he and his wife were investing \u0027in a company with tremendous impact on the world, one that is also an incredibly strong business.

His net worth has grown from $3.4 billion in March 2015 to $4.9 billion, but Forbes calculated that today, he is worth $2 billion more than at the start of this year, perhaps because of the Time purchase.The Time acquisition will reportedly cost Benioff around 21 percent of the estimated $900 million that he earned between the months of March 2017 to March 2018, which is only 4 percent of his previous $4.9 billion net worth, according to Business Insider.Bloomberg reported that Marc is 242nd on their Billionaires Index and probably earns staggering amounts, especially being a co-founder of Salesforce, which reported revenue of $10.5 billion in the twelve months leading up to January 31, 2018.Emmy winners 2018: All the British actors who picked up Emmy AwardsMarc Benioff net worth revealed as he buys Time Magazine Emmys 2018: How to watch the awards onlineWho is Fan Bingbing?

Kennedy Library Foundation via AP)It\u0027s just fun to see where the camera took them, said Nicola Mantzaris, a digital archivist who helped compile and catalog the fragile negatives, all carefully stored in subfreezing temperatures to slow their chemical decomposition.If you think about your own family photos and in what disarray they are in and just the volume - there\u0027s definitely a universal aspect to this, she said.Many of the photos are ordinary snaps of typical American family life in the first half of the 20th century: vacations, holidays, kids mugging for the camera, meals captured ever so slightly out of focus.But the candid images throw open a new window into a world that few have been able to peer into without physically visiting the presidential library in Boston, and even then by appointment with an archivist.The collection is the culmination of what presidential historians dubbed the Nitrate Negative Project, a nostalgic look back at the Kennedys through the lenses of the affordable cameras and black-and-white film that ushered in the era of amateur photography and family albums. The new technology also laid the foundation for today\u0027s social sharing platforms such as Instagram, complete with a few amusing instances of Kennedys appearing to photobomb one another.

To lose it would be a calamity - and a betrayal by our ministers Commentary by Alex Brummer For The Daily Mail The idea that a firm as prestigious and influential as Unilever, with a British heritage dating back to its foundation at Port Sunlight on the Wirral in the late 19th century, should be proposing to leave these shores is a terrible shock.Unilever is as British as Marmite – one of its big-name products – and 60 per cent of its annual sales of £54billion originate from the UK.The prospect of the giant moving out of the City became a reality last week when a 200-page prospectus, filled with complex technical detail and legalese, was delivered to investors who will vote on the issue at the end of next month.          Unilever is as British as Marmite – one of its big-name products – and 60 per cent of its annual sales of £54billion originate from the UKIf the Anglo-Dutch behemoth were to leave this country, it would have to quit the FTSE 100 index and, as a result, many of the big pension funds and insurers that look after the retirement funds of every pensioner and future retiree in Britain would be precluded from owning shares in one of our best-managed and most ethical and environmentally-conscious companies.The rules of many UK pension funds require that they only invest in UK-quoted companies for reasons of prudence, accountability and governance.Not surprisingly, one of the country’s biggest investors, the insurer Aviva, is rightly crying foul over the idea of Unilever’s move – arguing that the firm would no longer be a British company.Aviva’s chief investment officer, David Cumming, told the Financial Times: ‘We are not supportive and will vote against it. It doesn’t add any value for us and we lose quite a large company from the index. We don’t see any justification for the move.’          The prospect of the giant moving out of the City became a reality last week when a 200-page prospectus, filled with complex technical detail and legalese, was delivered to investors who will vote on the issue at the end of next monthThe reason Unilever wants to rebase in the Netherlands is founded on its bruising experience last year when it was subject of a £110billion takeover bid, which ultimately failed.In what would have been the second largest corporate deal in history, US giant Kraft Heinz (backed by private equity firms and the support one of the world’s richest men, Warren Buffett) launched an unsolicited bid for the maker of countless household names such as Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.Unilever’s Dutch chief executive, Paul Polman, a staunch advocate of ethical capitalism, fought off the bid and vowed to protect Unilever’s golden heritage from predators.To try to guarantee this and prevent any future raids, it was felt that the firm’s Anglo-Dutch structure, with share quotations, boards and headquarters in both Britain and Holland, should be simplified. This, management feels, is best achieved by a switch to Rotterdam.          If the Anglo-Dutch behemoth were to leave this country, it would have to quit the FTSE 100 index and, as a result, many of the big pension funds and insurers that look after the retirement funds of every pensioner and future retiree in Britain would be precluded from owning shares in one of our best-managed and most ethical and environmentally-conscious companiesThe intention is that Unilever will follow Royal Dutch Shell and the publishing and media colossus Reed Elsevier (now renamed Relx) which both separately decided to unify their shares under one umbrella while keeping share quotations in London as part of the FTSE 100 index.But Unilever wants to go one step further by coming out of the FTSE 100, claiming that it has more major Dutch than British investors. The truth is that the British Establishment’s reaction has been pathetic.It has shown monumental weakness and done nothing to ensure that Unilever stays here, while the Dutch government has done all in its power to encourage the move.A juicy carrot offered to Unilever chiefs by the Netherlands is the abolition of a measure that forces companies to pay the tax on idends distributed to shareholders upfront. This brings the Dutch system into line with the UK, which did the same several years ago as part of a successful effort to simplify our tax structure and make Britain the most attractive location for inward investment from overseas in Europe.          Prince Harry with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (right) and Paul Polman (left), CEO of Unilever backstage at the Atlantic Council\u0027s Annual Awards Dinner Honoring HRH Prince Harry at Ritz Carlton Hotel in Washington, DCThis tax change may have been the decisive factor for a Dutch-dominated board of directors. But there can be no doubt that their planned move to Rotterdam has been influenced by the Government’s woeful recent record at defending British companies against foreign predators.It’s a tragic truth that Britain has been allowed to become the most open market in the world to overseas takeovers – often with disastrous consequences for our national interests.For example, the £11.5billion takeover of Cadbury by Kraft led to the chocolate giant’s headquarters closing, its tax domicile switching from Britain to low-tax Switzerland and the unpopular meddling with the size, ingredients and taste of emblematic brands, including the Creme Egg.Other leading British brands have also been sold off, such as Costa Coffee being taken over by Coca-Cola, a company that has been heavily criticised for tax avoidance.By contrast, the Dutch authorities are much more protective against foreign takeovers.Last year, the chemical and paint giant Akzo Nobel (the owner of Britain’s Dulux brand) defended itself against a hostile bid by garnering the support of works councils, which have a key role in such takeover talks, as well as using provisions in Dutch competition law. Indeed, there is a clear view among analysts and some shareholders that the real purpose of Unilever’s proposal to move its domicile is to give itself maximum protection from any future bids for the group or attempts to force it to demerge any of its major brands.Aside from any other considerations, I am convinced that the decision to migrate from Britain makes no commercial sense.The fastest growing part of Unilever’s erse business involves beauty brands such as Dove and household products including Persil. There seems to be an insatiable demand for them from emerging economies in Asia and Latin America. The brains behind these best-sellers would remain in the UK because they are expected to make up 75 per cent of global sales, while the teams behind Unilever’s ice cream range Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and lesser products such as Lipton tea will be working in Holland.Whatever the management thinks, the major restructuring decision to separate the share quotation base and domicile from the home of the company’s main business is irrational.Inevitably, too, there are bound to be profound concerns that the Treasury could lose millions of pounds of corporate taxes from Unilever as a result of a switch to Rotterdam.Significantly, Holland has a reputation as a home for tax avoidance, with laws that offer a shield from taxation on profits.Such enticements have lured firms including Starbucks, Google and IBM to set up offices, while the Rolling Stones and U2, too, have taken advantage of Dutch tax shelters.Of course, there has been a widespread suspicion that Unilever’s break from the FTSE 100 is being done as a protective measure in case trading conditions suffer as a result of Brexit.However, my conversations with Unilever executives do not lead me to think this is a major issue, although it may be preying on the minds of Dutch shareholders and bosses driving the process.Even so, I am utterly convinced that if Unilever leaves Britain, the company will do itself great damage.Its shares would be less attractive to both overseas and British investors who value Anglo-Saxon capitalism, the weight of financial expertise in Britain and access to the strongest capital markets in Europe.With Britain’s national interest at stake, is it beyond hope that the Government might finally wake up to the huge potential cost to this country’s economy of what would be a calamitous decision for a company as important as Unilever to move its HQ abroad? "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/16/504D69A600000578-0-image-m-59_1537198254203.jpg","title":"Derbyshire dog owner returns holiday Croatia news Staffordshire terrier down","story":"    Staffordshire bull terrier, Blue, was put down by kennel staff while his owner was on holidayMr Hall, who suffers from depression, said Blue was helping him to tackle his mental health issues.The father-of-four was \u0027heartbroken\u0027 and had to tell his children that their beloved pet had gone to \u0027doggy heaven\u0027.He said: \u0027Blue didn\u0027t have a violent bone in his body.

He then collected Blue\u0027s ashes a few weeks later.The council\u0027s policy states that if a dog is not collected within seven days, it is then the property of the council.A Derby City Council spokesperson said: \u0027Mr Hall\u0027s dog was picked up by our contracted stray dog service, after he was reported by a member of the public to be on a public highway.\u0027Some local residents kindly kept the dog until officers were able to get to him. He was reportedly aggressive towards the residents and officers.\u0027The dog had no tag, but officers scanned the dog for contact details of the owner.\u0027We tried to call Mr Hall however got no response, and so visited the address, and an information card was left when there was no answer.          Mr Hall\u0027s neighbour had taken Blue for a walk when the dog ran away and was captured by wardens\u0027As we were unable to reunite the dog with its owner, he was taken to kennels. Stray dogs are cared for in kennels for seven days, after which point, they are legally owned by Derby City Council.\u0027Our kennels received no contact from the friend or owner, and there was no report of this dog being lost.\u0027The dog showed signs of aggression to the kennel owner and kennel staff, so after the seven days had passed, and no contact had been received, we had to take the difficult decision to put the dog to sleep.\u0027Dogs who show aggression and cannot safely be adopted or rehomed are, where appropriate, put to sleep.\u0027We do not take that decision lightly, and would only ever decide to put a dog to sleep if it was deemed absolutely necessary.\u0027Had the kennels received information or were contacted to state that the owners were on holiday then the dog would of course have remained in kennels to allow the owners to come forward. On returning from his holiday, the owner has contacted the Council and we have fully discussed the situation with him.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/17/14/504C7AA100000578-0-image-a-10_1537191560106.jpg","title":"Older age groups drink way allows carry responsibilities study finds","story":"    Research finds middle-aged Britons care more whether their drinking harms their image than if it is bad for their health.

Failing to meet responsibilities, causing harm to others and the potential loss of respectability could be a better message for older adults to cut their drinking.Gender also played a role in what was considered acceptable drinking, with drunk women viewed more negatively than men.Mrs Muhlack, whose study was published in the BMC Public Health journal, said: \u0027It is surprising that health does not strongly factor in the way this group thinks about their drinking.

The proposal was the highlight of the 70th Annual Emmy Awards show, which was hosted by Saturday Night Live\u0027s Michael Che and Colin Jost, and received a very mixed response from viewers, some of whom criticized the comedy as \u0027awkward\u0027 and \u0027flat\u0027.The SNL veterans kicked off one of the most political Emmys yet with jokes that ranged from Roseanne Barr\u0027s canceled show to Ronan Farrow\u0027s impact on the #MeToo movement.Diversity was also the word of the night at the awards show, despite the fact that the show came nowhere close to last year\u0027s historical wins, which included the first black man to win a lead acting trophy, the first black woman to receive a writing trophy, and the first South Asian man to receive an acting award.Jost and Che brought the current events they discuss every Saturday on SNL\u0027s Weekend Update to Hollywood, and no recent headline maker was left untouched.Disgraced comedian Roseanne Barr may have been absent from the telecast, but she was present in a variety of jokes throughout the night.          Michael Che and Colin Jost kicked off the Emmys with jokes that ranged from Roseanne Barr\u0027s canceled show to Ronan Farrow\u0027s impact on the #MeToo movementThe SNL hosts were listing canceled shows saved by other networks when they mentioned Barr\u0027s axed hit series following her racist tweet.\u0027Roseanne was canceled by herself, but picked up by white nationalists,\u0027 Jost quipped. \u0027She\u0027s had a rough year,\u0027 Che added. \u0027I heard Roseanne is moving to Israel .\u0027\u0027I mean damn, how messed up is your life you have to go to the Middle East to get peace of mind?\u0027The hosts then mentioned Laurie Metcalfe, who received a supporting actress nomination for her work on Roseanne, to a round of applause from the audience.\u0027You know how great you have to be to get nominated for Roseanne now?\u0027 Che asked the crowd.    One celebrity who seemed to sum up the feelings about the SNL stars, who host Weekend Update together, was the ever-memable Chrissy Teigan who appeared to visibly cringe during a joke about Roseanne\u0027s show being cancelled over her racist tweet\u0027That\u0027s like nominating a cop for a BET award, it doesn\u0027t happen - that would be weird.\u0027The #MeToo movement was also a big part of the SNL hosts\u0027 monologue, hardly a surprise after it consumed television with the downfalls of Les Moonves, Matt Lauer, Louis CK, and Charlie Rose in the last year.\u0027You know it\u0027s an honor to be here sharing this night with the many talented and creative people who haven\u0027t been caught yet,\u0027 they joked.\u0027This year the audience is allowed to drink in their seats...cause the one thing Hollywood needs right now are people losing their inhibitions at award functions,\u0027 Jost added.The hosts, who came back onto the stage 40 minutes after the show began to note all six of the first awards had been won by white people, also touched on ersity.He noted that Netflix had the most nominations for the night, adding: \u0027If you\u0027re a network executive that\u0027s the scariest thing you can probably hear...except, Sir, Ronan Farrow is on line one,\u0027 he quipped to a roar of laughter from the crowd, noting how the New Yorker journalist has broken a slew of #MeToo exposes.\u0027You don\u0027t want that call,\u0027 Che added.Che cracked another controversial gag when he said: \u0027My mother doesn\u0027t like watching white award shows cause you guys don\u0027t thank Jesus enough.          The monologue came after an all-star song and dance number that jokingly claimed Hollywood had solved its long-running ersity problem          SNL stars Kate McKinnon and Kenan Thompson kicked off the number, noting this year\u0027s Emmys had the most erse group of nominees in history          Suddenly Ricky Martin appears and stops the production. \u0027You haven\u0027t solved it,\u0027 he says. \u0027This is way too white,\u0027 before leading them in the dance number \u0027The only white people who thank Jesus are Republicans and ex-crackheads.\u0027Che then noted how although things were getting better, television has \u0027always had a ersity problem\u0027.The monologue came after an all-star song and dance number that jokingly claimed Hollywood had solved its long-running ersity problemSNL stars Kate McKinnon and Kenan Thompson kicked off the number, noting this year\u0027s Emmys had the most erse group of nominees in history\u0027They did 15 seasons of ER without one Filipino nurse - have you been to a hospital?\u0027 he quipped to laughs from the audience.\u0027Even on a great show like Cheers, they made a show about an all-white sports bar in 1980s Boston and not one black dude walked in and then walked out?\u0027Jost listed a slew of new revivals that were coming out with people of color in the lead roles, before joking it would be balanced out by an \u0027all-white Atlanta\u0027.\u002715 miles outside of Atlanta focuses on white women who call the police on the cast of Atlanta,\u0027 he said.The hosts continued to get political as Jost joked that things were very different when the Emmys were first held in 1949.          They patted themselves on the back for giving Sandra Oh the first Emmy leading actress nomination to an Asian woman. \u0027It\u0027s an honor just to be Asian,\u0027 she joked (next to her mother)          Network FX also managed to score five wins thanks to the success of the Assassination of Gianni Versace, which took home three awards\u0027We all agreed that Nazis were bad,\u0027 he quipped as the audience burst into a huge round of applause. Che also joked about The Handmaid\u0027s Tale being painted as a show of fiction.\u0027The Handmaid\u0027s Tale takes place in an imaginary future where a group of people are forced to work and make babies against their will,\u0027 he began.\u0027That\u0027s what black people call history.\u0027The hosts also took a subtle aim at Donald Trump as they brought up the Obamas\u0027 new production deal with Netflix.\u0027My dream is they only produce their own version of The Apprentice and it gets way higher ratings,\u0027 Che said.The monologue came after an all-star song and dance number that jokingly claimed Hollywood had solved its long-running ersity problem.They patted themselves on the back for giving Sandra Oh the first Emmy leading actress nomination to an Asian woman. \u0027It\u0027s an honor just to be Asian,\u0027 she joked (next to her mother).

Social media pictures (above) purportedly showed explosions and rockets in the night sky around Latakia close to where the incident happened          The Russian defence ministry said it held Israel responsible because, at the time of the incident, Israeli fighter jets were mounting air attacks on Syria targets and had only given Moscow one minute\u0027s warning, not enough time for the Russian plane to get to safety. Pictures on social media showed explosions in the area last night          The Il-20 (file picture), a turbo-prop plane used for electronic reconnaissance, was brought down as it came into land at Russia\u0027s Hmeymim air base near LatakiaIsrael\u0027s military later expressed \u0027sorrow\u0027  for the deaths of crew members  but blamed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Iran.\u0027Israel expresses sorrow for the deaths of the aircrew members of the Russian plane that was downed tonight due to Syrian anti-aircraft fire,\u0027 a military statement said in Israel\u0027s first reaction to the incident.\u0027Israel holds the Assad regime, whose military shot down the Russian plane, fully responsible for this incident. Israel also holds Iran and the Hezbollah terror organisation accountable for this unfortunate incident.\u0027 The incident, which happened late on Monday, was the worst case of friendly fire between the two allies since Russia\u0027s game-changing military intervention in September 2015. Earlier, the Russian defence ministry had said that the plane, carrying 14 people, had gone off the radar around 11pm during an attack by four Israeli F-16 jets over Syrian infrastructure in the province of Latakia, a stronghold of President Bashar al-Assad.It happened moments after Turkey and Russia announced a deal that offered millions of people reprieve from a threatened military assault in northern Syria. There was no immediate word from Damascus, but the deadly air war sequence started when missiles struck the coastal region of Latakia on Monday.Israeli pilots carrying out attacks on Syrian targets \u0027used the Russian plane as a cover, exposing it to fire from Syrian air defences,\u0027 the Russian military said.Russian spies \u0027who were planning to HACK into the Swiss lab...Violent clashes break out in Kiev after Ukraine agrees to...Ex-British soldier, 25, who fought with Kurdish militia...Share this article\u002715 Russian servicemen died,\u0027 it said, adding Moscow reserved \u0027the right to proper retaliatory actions\u0027 against Israel.It made no further mention of a French frigate the Russian defence ministry had earlier claimed also opened fire from the area on Monday.The French army had denied any involvement and Syria state media had reported late Monday that air defences had intercepted missiles targeting Latakia.\u0027Our air defences are countering hostile missiles coming from the sea towards the city of Latakia, and a number of them have been intercepted,\u0027 it said, quoting a military source. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, some missiles did get through and struck ammunition depots at the site of the technical industries institute.Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Britain-based monitoring group, said at least two fighters were killed and 10 wounded in the strike.    The Russian reconnaissance plane was brought down by Syrian missiles as it was approaching Hmeymim airbase          Earlier, the Russian defence ministry had said that the plane had gone off the radar around 11pm during an attack by four Israeli F-16 jets over Syrian infrastructure in the province of Latakia, a stronghold of President Bashar al-Assad. Pictures on social media showed explosions in the Latakia area last night\u0027Two bodies were found,\u0027 he told AFP, adding that he could not immediately confirm whether the casualties were soldiers or militiamen from forces supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Israel has conducted frequent raids in recent months against Syria\u0027s military infrastructure, including against bases it believes host Iranian combattants.Earlier in September, Israel admitted carrying out 200 strikes in Syria over the past 18 months.The Syrian blunder came hot on the heels of a major deal announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan after talks in the Russian resort of Sochi.The two main brokers in northern Syria agreed to create a 15-20 kilometre-wide demilitarised zone along the line of contact between rebels and regime troops in the Idlib region.That would be achieved by October 15 and would entail a withdrawal of all jihadist fighters from the area.The demilitarised zone will be secured with the help of \u0027mobile patrol groups of Turkish contingents and contingents of Russian military police,\u0027 Putin said.By the end of the year, transportation routes between the key port of Latakia and Aleppo as well as Latakia and the major city of Hama must be restored, he added. Iran, the third member of the so-called Astana process aimed at ending the seven-year civil war in Syria, praised the deal as an example of \u0027responsible diplomacy.\u0027Three million people reside in the Idlib region, the last significant chunk of Syria still held by rebels and jihadists.The UN had warned that a fully-fledged ground assault aimed at completing Damascus\u0027 military reconquest could spark the worst humanitarian catastrophe yet in a conflict that has killed more 360,000.Observers and residents of the Idlib region were sceptical however of a deal that appeared to be little more than a temporary fix.\u0027This could be a win for diplomacy and that\u0027s what Syria needs more of to solve this crisis,\u0027 said Lorraine Bramwell, Syria country director for International Rescue Committee.\u0027However, we have seen previously how de-escalation deals haven\u0027t lasted long term,\u0027 she added.Hundreds of people gathered in Binnish, a town in the rebel-held province of Binnish, following Monday\u0027s announcement in Sochi.\u0027The demand of the Syrian people, since the very first day, has remained unchanged: it\u0027s the fall of the regime,\u0027 said Wassim Souweid, one of the demonstrators.\u0027I reckon this decision will not stop bombardments on civilians, will not offer any alternative to the people,\u0027 he added."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/28/16/05CC4332000003E8-5444853-Theresa_May_and_Jean_Claude_Juncker_agreed_the_outline_of_a_divo-a-6_1519834166574.jpg","title":"Hilarious moment golden retriever films inside mouth","story":"    The footage, filmed somewhere in the UK, captures the playful pup as it watches its owner fix his bright red bicycleBut his dog had no interest in the scene before it, and loitered around as it waited for attention.It soon gives up -

This is what is currently being turned into legal language for the withdrawal treaty.           EU Negotiator Michel Barnier (right in Brussels last week) maybe given new guidelines this week within which to strike a deal. EU Council President Donald Tusk (left) has said the meeting must reach a \u0027common view\u0027 on the shape of the future UK-EU relationshipEU Summit, Brussels, October 18-19October\u0027s EU summit has long been pencilled in as the opportunity for EU leaders to agree the withdrawal treaty on the terms of exit and a political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and EU.If a deal can be struck in October, it leaves plenty of time for it to be agreed in the UK and ratified in the EU, paving the way for an orderly Brexit in March.A deal is not expected to be finalised at this summit but both sides will hope for significant progress - even if the summit is used to set out the iding lines one last time.  Emergency EU Summit, Brussels, November 13 A one-day emergency summit in November is now widely expected. If it happens, there will be acute political pressure to finalise both the withdrawal treaty and political declaration - if nothing else to allow the EU to return to other business.Expect a high stakes meeting and a late night finish. Failure will see both sides walking up to the brink of a chaotic exit and peering over the edge.   The response of the European Council (including German Chancellor Angela Merkel) will be crucial in the next stages of the EU talks EU Summit, Brussels, December  13-14Given the need to ratify the deal, the December summit is the last chance to strike a deal. Brexit is not supposed to be on the agenda: if the talks reach this summit there has been a major breakdown.The EU does infamously find a way to agreement at the 11th hour and if Brexit talks are still live in December, many will hope for a fudge that can get both sides over the line.Last year, talks on the outline orce deal were pushed to December and a deal was  - just - reached. The so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 in the UK Parliament, January 2019 Assuming there is a withdrawal treaty and political declaration, the next stage is for the action is in the UK Parliament.Mrs May promised Tory Remain rebels a \u0027meaningful\u0027 vote on the final deal in both the Commons and Lords.This is expected to be a simple yes or no vote on what she has negotiated - so in theory a detailed withdrawal treaty, spelling out the orce bill and other issues such as citizens\u0027 rights, and the political declaration on the future relationship.Linking the two will be a high stakes moment. Brexiteers do not want to sign off the orce bill without a trade deal and Remainers are reluctant to vote for a blind Brexit.But the Prime Minister has made clear it is deal or no deal: accept what she has negotiated or leave Britain crashing out on March 29, 2019 with no agreement in place. If the meaningful vote is passed, there will be a series of further votes as the withdrawal treaty is written into British law.          The Prime Minister (pictured at the EU Council in June) has made clear it is deal or no deal: accept what she has negotiated or leave Britain crashing out on March 29, 2019 with no agreement in placeRatification in the EU, February 2019 After the meaningful vote in the UK, the EU will have to ratify the agreement. This is a two stage process.National parliaments in all 27 countries have to vote on the deal. It does not need to pass everywhere but must be carried in at least 20 of the 27 countries, with Yes votes covering at least 65 per cent of the EU population.The European Parliament must also vote in favour of the deal. It has a representative in the talks, Guy Verhofstadt, who has repeatedly warned the deal must serve the EU\u0027s interests.In practice, once the leaders of the 27 member states have agreed a deal, ratification on the EU side should be assured.Exit day, March 29, 2019 At 11pm on March 29, 2019, Britain will cease to be a member of the European Union, two years after triggering Article 50 and almost three years after the referendum. Exit happens at 11pm because it must happen on EU time.If the transition deal is in place, little will change immediately - people will travel in the same way as today and goods will cross the border normally. But Britain\u0027s MEPs will no longer sit in the European Parliament and British ministers will no longer take part in EU meetings.Negotiations will continue to turn the political agreement on the future partnership into legal text that will eventually become a second treaty. Both sides will build new customs and immigration controls in line with what this says.If there is no deal, there is little clarity on what will happen. Britain has outlined contingencies for a catastrophic breakdown in transport and goods networks in practice short term, small side deals will be likely be rapidly negotiated to avert the worst consequences.

It\u0027s relevant to ask with back pain about their job if they do a lot of sitting or walking and my interest immediately peaked when I heard about her refugee work and that interest took over.\u0027Previously I did volunteer work for Mother Teresa in 1981, worked in Jordan and refugee camps, looking after children.           The alleged victim has not given any statement apart from a wish never to see Dean again\u0027I put her number as a contact in my phone but only used it once. I now would never do that again as I understand about privacy and information\u0027.\u0027She came in with back pain and that was the focus of the consultation but I allowed my own interests to get in the way of the appointment.\u0027I honestly didn\u0027t think she would find it inappropriate and I am completely devastated as I do not want to upset patients\u0027.He has attended a course on maintaining boundaries between doctors and patients and says he has learned his lesson.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told the incident occurred on April 11 2017 when Dean was working as a locum for a single day at a surgery in Gloucester. Iona Neve of NHS England said: \u0027We had a face to face meeting with Dr Dean but he did not seem to understand why the patient might be uncomfortable and lacked significant insight.\u0027It was worrying - his body language was more relaxed than expected and his attitude was poor and the information wasn\u0027t going in. There was almost a lack of understanding of why patient A felt uncomfortable and felt the need to complain.\u0027He was dismissive and his attitude was inadequate. He says it was profession to profession as they had a common interest in refugees. He liked to chat to his patients and often ran late to talk to them. \u0027He didn\u0027t seem to accept that some people may feel this is uncomfortable and didn\u0027t want that. Patient A didn\u0027t want to see Dr Dean again but she didn\u0027t want to make a further complaint.\u0027  The Cambridge-educated doctor has been warned about crossing doctor-patient boundaries in the pastThe hearing was told Dean had been given a warning in 2016 after another female patient made a complaint about him. At the time he gave an apology and a letter of advice was provided to him about professional standards.According to his Facebook page Dean whose oldest daughter works as an engineer in Stockholm and whose younger daughter is starting a degree at Nottingham university, studied social and political sciences at Cambridge before qualifying in medicine at Goldsmiths, University of London. He also studied a BA in Fine Art.He admits the allegations and the hearing continues. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/15/20/5038C11400000578-0-image-m-14_1537039745161.jpg","title":"Student leapt bedroom window landed HEAD pavement","story":"Alix Taylor, pictured here in hospital, started hallucinating, stripped naked, and plummeted from the first floorOne show lying in a hospital bed, battered and bruised, and another shows her sitting in a wheelchair, with her hair matted in blood, while a close up shot shows crusted blood in her ears - showing the dramatic impact her fall had.   Ms Taylor had been on a night out in Glasgow with friends when one of her male friends was violently sick and \u0027appeared to have been spiked.\u0027In a lengthy Facebook post Ellie told how her sister left the nightclub \u0027visibly drunk\u0027 and crying.She said her sister made it home and was comforted by her flatmate before going to bed.    The image, shared by her sister on Facebook, shows blood coming from her ears and her matted hairBritish tourist is IMPALED through leg by parasol after...Mother-of-three, 25, dies a week after falling from 11th...Share this articleShe wrote: \u0027Fast forward about an hour, and two passers-by had heard awoman\u0027s frantic screams for help.\u0027They rushed round to see Alix completely naked balancing outside on her window sill.

It was the brainchild of scientist and inventor Edwin Land and his Harvard tutor George Wheelwright and at first made the plastic for polarising sunglasses. In time, it was to create and popularise instant photography, launching a seriesof pioneering cameras and film formats. These inspired generations of artists, including Andy Warhol, Helmut Newton, Robert Mapplethorpe, Maripol, Keith Haring and Guy Bourdin. They helped to raise Polaroid to the status of cultural icon.This month, Polaroid Originals, launched the OneStep+ instant analogue camera which brings analogue instant photography up to date, as it can be connected to a smartphone app, enabling a range of effects.In 1943, Land’s three-year-old daughter asked her father why she couldn’t immediately see the photograph he had just taken of her. His first instant camera went on sale for $89.95 in 1948, and became the the template for Polaroid cameras for the next 15 years.Throughout the 50s, the Polaroid empire grew, with products distributed to more than 45 countries. The Polaroid SX-70 camera – the first camera to produce self-developing, colour instant photos – was launched in 1972. Edwin Land also appeared on the cover of Life magazine with his “magic camera”. But, with the swift rise of digital technology eclipsing instant photography by the 2000s, in 2008 Polaroid announced that it was stopping making instant film.After the company’s announcement, a group of enthusiasts stepped in, calling themselves the Impossible Project, to buy the world’s last remaining Polaroid film factory, at Enschede in the Netherlands.Polaroid’s production chain had been abandoned before the Impossible team bought the factory later in 2008. There were no negatives, no dyes and no suppliers to hand. They had to start from scratch, and reinvent the lost recipes for Polaroid film. The company rebranded itself last year as Polaroid Originals after acquiring Polaroid’s brand and intellectual property, and is the only company in the world making film for Polaroid cameras.In its heyday, when Polaroid was producing 5,000 cameras a day, the Enschede factory produced more than 50m film packs per year and employed many people in the city of Enschede. Several employees who started at the plant in the 1970s still work there. Andrew Billen, head of global manufacturing at Polaroid Originals, explains some of the key processes in producing Polaroid film.First, the foil that will carry the developing fluid is prepared. A red dye is applied, which is a kind of semi-permanent adhesive. This allows the paste to remain protected from the air, but will ensure that the pod ruptures correctly when the film is ejecting from the camera, thereby setting off the development process.  Then the  foil is slit into the exact width needed to make sachet of chemical developing paste called a “pod”.Depending on the type of negative, a recipe of chemicals is weighed out and placed in a large mixing vessel. It is then heated and blended. The paste is then pumped out into smaller drums ready for the next stage.The foil is run through a machine where a very small, exact quantity of the developing paste is added then heat sealed into the pod. Pods are loaded into metal trays, which are then transported to the film assembly machines to eventually be laminated to each inidual photo frame.Rolls of negative are fed through machines with very sharp circular knives, cut to size and then wound on to cardboard cores ready to be loaded into the film assembly machines.Negative materials are light sensitive, so they need to be cut in complete darkness. A special machine is required and its operators wear night-vision googles. Non-light-sensitive materials  are cut on a similar machine in the lightTo make the film cassettes,  black plastic granules are fed into an injection moulding machine, heated until they melt, then injected into a mould cavity. The plastic is then quickly cooled and the  cassette is ejected on to a conveyor. Cassettes are then transported to the film assembly machines.In the final stage, the  border mask and sheet are fed into the assembly machine. Here, in darkness, they are joined to the light-sensitive negative.After going through a series of cutting, folding and laminating processes, a developer pod is fixed to each frame. A stack of eight finished frames is then inserted into a plastic cassette together with a metal spring and (sometimes) a battery. A card known as a “dark slide” is then added to the top of the packs to prevent light corrupting the negative, then the finished plastic cassette is welded shut. The finished pack is inserted into a foil pouch which goes into a cardboard box.The machines – installed in the 1970s – are completely analogue. Operating and maintaining them requires a great deal of skill and take years to learn. Operators will occasionally need to enter the machine and work for short periods of time in complete darkness. They do this without night-vision googles,  completely by feel.The factory also purchases vintage Polaroid cameras from all over the world. These are cleaned, repaired and tested. Many date from the 1970s, and spare parts have to come from donor cameras as new spares are not available.In the 80s, built-in flash and point-and-shoot capability quickly became one of the most iconic and recognisable Polaroid features. These developments were followed by the introduction of wide-format film for use in professional settings such as medical examinations and police investigations. The 80s also brought a surge of influential users into the world of Polaroid, with artists and photographers such as Mary Ellen Mark, David Hockney, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Sarah Moon. More recently, artists including Ryan McGinley and Nobuyoshi Araki have continued to be inspired by the Polaroid creative tradition.The 80th anniversary of Edwin Land’s original Polaroid company was on 13 September 2017. The date also marked the renaming of the Impossible Project as Polaroid Originals. The Polaroid Originals OneStep+ camera, launched this month by Polaroid Originals, connects smartphones via bluetooth to an app to access creative tools such as double exposure, light-painting features, plus remote trigger and manual modes. The app also permits use of a secondary portrait lens for close-ups. The new device also has a flash and long-lasting rechargeable battery.

It keeps only an hour’s-worth of parts and relies on deliveries from about 350 trucks every day to provide the parts required to make the cars on a “just in time” basis.Howells said that as well as meaning higher tariffs, a no-deal Brexit would cost Honda in terms of additional bureaucracy and damage productivity.“From an administrative point of view, we’d probably be looking at 60,000-odd additional bits of documentation we’d have to provide to get product to and from Europe,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live.“That impacts our productivity, certainly in terms of the flow of product, but also it does hit potentially our competitiveness. Of course if we are shipping and competing against a European manufacturer in Europe, they’re not incurring those tariffs.”Howells added that despite the potentially negative impact a no-deal Brexit would have on Honda’s UK operations, its Japanese owners have no plans to move production away from Swindon.“The UK forms part of our global network of manufacturing plants, so the only place we produce the vehicle we produce at Swindon is in Swindon itself. The logistics of moving a factory the size of Swindon would be huge and as far as we’re concerned, we’re right behind supporting continued production at Swindon,” he said.The warning from Honda on the challenges posed by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit comes a day after Jaguar Land Rover – the largest manufacturer of cars in the UK – announced that about 2,000 staff will move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant.The company said it had taken the decision to reduce production at the West Midlands site as it grapples with difficult conditions in the car industry, caused by Brexit and the slump in sales of diesel-powered cars.Last week, Jaguar Land Rover warned “tens of thousands” of jobs could be lost in the sector if the government failed to reach an agreement with Brussels.The UK automotive industry has repeatedly called on Theresa May’s government to prioritise the sector in its negotiations with the EU, arguing that car manufacturing in Britain risks “death by a thousand cuts” if multinationals choose to invest in countries other than the UK after Brexit.The average UK-built car has about 6,000 parts and the majority come from the EU. Parts can sometimes pass through four countries before reaching the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1b92cf4eb7d44debf78d26188cabe0a5ce683e9/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edcc512eb559c0c3a386d7ba7e9ee15a","title":"would that all journeys were on foot writers on the joy of walking","story":"Will Self, Fran Lebowitz, Helen Garner and others share their love letters to urban pedestrianismFor Walking the City week – exploring all aspects of urban walking, good and bad – writers tell us where they walk and why.Will Self watches the world go by at Charing Cross in London Fran Lebowitz finds areas of midtown New York off-limits because Donald Trump lives there Helen Garner says her quotidian route through her Melbourne suburb is not beautiful or meaningful to anyone but her.These and other writers have shared their love letters to urban walking. And we’re eager to hear yours. You can send your routes, views and reflections to us using this form, or on social media with the hashtag #Walking.I walk in London a great deal, and always have. In my teenage years and my 20s, I mainly walked because I was skint. But with age – and some emolument – has come walking for health physical – and more importantly mental. My favourite walk is a workaday one, from my home in Stockwell – where I both live and work – to Soho, in yet more central London, where I socialise and shop.There are several possible routes: the grandstanding one takes me past the Vauxhall Tavern, south London’s most celebrated gay pub, and its near neighbour, the MI6 building then along the Thames embankment, past the Houses of Parliament, and up Whitehall to Trafalgar Square, before I work my way through the backstreets around Leicester Square and enter Soho. But should I want to avoid busy streets, and the phalanxes of tourists battling it out against the three-card-monte scam merchants on Westminster Bridge, I can cross at Vauxhall instead, and make my way through the Arts and Crafts blocks of flats behind Tate Britain (built as social housing, but now luxury flats – many of which are used as pied-à-terres by our lordly legislators), then along Marsham Street through the back of Parliament Square, along Horseguards, and via King George’s steps, up to Lower Regent Street and Piccadilly.Listen, I know it seems an insult to detail all these storied landmarks as my mere way-stations en route to buy some stationery, or have a coffee with a friend. But in my defence – despite the depredations of neoliberalism, and its sequel: the complete commoditisation of urban space – it remains the case that London is a very big city indeed. If you know your way around it (or are prepared to get lost), you can always find a vista that’s been overlooked, or an under-recognised corner of a familiar neighbourhood. There’s this – and there’s the delight of true flânerie: the ambulatory pursuit of chance encounters, overheard aperçus, and those little unrepeatable vignettes that constitute the never-ending drama of urban life.It was Dr Johnson who remarked that if you were to stand by the Charing Cross for long enough, you’d see the entire world go by. My regular walk can take me past this spot – which feels to me like some strange sort of still point, around which that processing world does indeed revolve. But then that could be because I was born in the old Charing Cross hospital, a few yards away – which means that even my quotidian pedestrianism loops me back in to my own lifecycle.I’ve never taken a walk just to walk. People who drive everywhere “take a walk”, but for me it’s a form of transportation. I like to walk because, first of all, you’re in control. I could tell you exactly how long it will take you to get from one point in New York to another because I’ve walked it a million times. This is not something you say of the subway. It could take you 10 minutes, or it could take you an hour, or you may never get there.Walking used to be a kind of pleasure, but it is really an enormous effort to make your way around town on foot. The bicycles everywhere, the tourists everywhere, some tourists on bicycles – the worst possible combination. I feel like I’m in The Exorcist, my head twirling around to see what way they’re coming from. The cyclists are in general quite smug, with that expression on their face like “I am saving the planet”. I always think: “No, I am.” They didn’t have to manufacture me in a factory. When I wear out, they’re not going to throw me away in a pile of metal and plastic.The tourists obviously come from places where no one walks anywhere. They don’t think of the sidewalk as a road for humans. Though they may annoy me – all humans annoy me – people who live and work here are always in a rush to get where they’re going, because they have to get to work to make enough money to be able to afford their apartment. They don’t stand in the middle of the sidewalk on their phones.I do not have a phone so when everyone started looking at their phones all the time, I could not believe that everyone was abdicating the observation of New York and giving the whole city to me. I am always saying to people: “did you notice that building?” And they say “no”, because no one looks up except me. To me, it’s like winning a lottery. They just handed me the city. I’m the official noticer.Of course Trump has made everything in the world worse, including being a pedestrian. Because he lives right on Fifth Avenue there is a big part of midtown you can’t even go down anymore. Now it’s Trump’s area. If he is there, or his wife is there, you can’t walk on that block. I’ve had numerous fights with cops about this. A cop once told me: “You cannot walk on this block”. I said: “I am walking on this block”. I almost got arrested, she was so angry at me.Most of my memories of walking stand out for being unpleasant. But there was one day in the seventies, back when New York was mostly filled with New Yorkers. I was walking up Madison Avenue and I noticed that the people walking towards me were kind of stopped. It was just very odd. Of course Madison Avenue is very fancy, especially then – I had never seen people behaving like this.There, coming towards me, was Cary Grant, in a white linen suit, with his white linen hair. He was emanating white. There are a million celebrities in New York. One thing you must never do is look at them, especially not on Madison Avenue. I had never seen New Yorkers stop like that. As told to Elle HuntI walk this exact route through my Melbourne suburb of Flemington every morning. It’s not beautiful or meaningful to anyone but me.I barge out my front gate, under plane trees in which magpies sometimes warble. I cross the railway bridge, turn east at the house with the huge fig tree, then north again, past the brick garage and its inexplicably prolific gardenia bush. Nothing much to report till I reach the witch’s house with the iron lace veranda and the hedge of dark pink rose bushes that no one’s pruned for years. Every day I think their disgraceful neglect of those roses entitles me to pinch some on my way back. But I know I won’t because my walk is a circle and I won’t pass them again till tomorrow.I cut through the booze warehouse car park and dash across the big road to the Bikram yoga school, then e into the street with the weird antique shop on the corner. Good houses in a row, big wide Californian bungalows. Here, where the street drops downhill to the hockey fields and the concreted creek bed, I once saw a fox go strolling home at dawn. Another day a horrible man cursed me out and kicked my dog in the ribs.Where the shared pedestrian and cycle track runs alongside the freeway wall I turn south again and pick up speed. Riders heading for the city zoom up behind me with sharp little warning chimes, and gusts of air as they pass. I’m breathing hard and feeling powerful. Here comes the old Chinese couple, the dead-faced woman and the husband with his desperate smile. A tradesman in hi-vis stands in the middle of the football oval, reaches for the sky and bows three times.At the primary school I turn right and tackle the steepest hill. Halfway up, panting, nearly home, I cop the first lemony whiffs of my reward: pittosporum blossom. Its perfume floats between the houses from an invisible tree.If I can scoop up that McDonald’s rubbish from the playground gate and shove it into the bin without breaking stride, I’ll have earned myself a lucky day. All this, with its seasonal variations, takes up 40 minutes of what remains of my life, in my undistinguished and beloved suburb.One of the great joys of my years in Los Angeles was being able to leave my car at home and walk – to a cafe, a supermarket, the library, the beach. In the world’s car capital this could seem a transgressive act, putting one foot in front of the other. This, after all, is a sprawling metropolis where sidewalks often don’t exist, where everyone obsesses about exit ramps and parking and where traffic jams get nicknamed carmageddon.But in Santa Monica, a small city wedged between Malibu and Venice, walking was not only feasible, it was pleasurable and an efficient way to get around. My morning routine included wheeling my toddler from our home on Montana Avenue to her daycare at the YMCA on Sixth Street, a one mile, 15-minute stroll past low-rise homes, stores, offices and cafes.Sunshine, wide pavements, pedestrian-friendly crossings – it was bliss. We were on nodding terms with some joggers and dog-walkers, listened to birdsong, paused to collect pebbles, monitored Fourth of July bunting giving way to Halloween pumpkins, then Christmas trees. I learned the timing of the traffic lights on Wilshire Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare, with precision, knowing when to stroll, to trot, to gallop, my daughter strapped into her stroller shouting “faster”.During the long, hot summers and autumns I had one grumble: palm trees. Great for postcards, useless for shade.Visitors praise Wellington for its compactness. “It’s so compact!” The word is said with a sort of chef’s kiss.It is convenient to be able to walk everywhere, but that’s also why, sometimes, I don’t want to walk everywhere. Everyone else will also be walking everywhere. Wellington is a relatively young city but its history of unwanted social encounters is richly layered.I was once walking on Wellington’s beautiful south coast, along a long footpath – empty but for an old housemate of mine with whom I’d badly fallen out years earlier. We walked towards each other on that path by the sea, as though in chilling slow motion and after approximately 100 years, we passed. It felt like an outtake of Blue Planet.To succeed as a walker in Wellington, you must embrace the turbulence – both social and, infamously, weather-related. When it rains, you’ll want to rip out the slippery cobblestones of death in the central city on gale-force days, you’ll want to campaign to have the city rebuilt underground.The biggest problem I have to contend with when walking is truly my own annoyance. A sudden hail-studded gale blowing open my jacket – I’m indignant. Slow walkers on a tiny footpath and there’s nowhere to pass – my spleen’s swelling. A 4WD mounting the pavement so that it can pass an oncoming car on a narrow road – I’m Larry David in Paris. I’ve internalised the city’s melodramatic tendencies.But then you’ll be stumping along in a gale and suddenly the silvery harbour is winking through trees. Or a native wood pigeon is perched on a powerline, its chest puffed out like a doughnut. Even the overhead wires for trolley buses that used to crisscross the skyline lent the streets a punk beauty. Wellington is full of these postcard moments, and you see more of them when you’re on foot.Sometimes, if you’ve been here long enough, when you look into the contorted faces of other pedestrians as they’re lashed by rain, you can just about see a kind of zen-like triumph. In Delhi, the female pedestrian is a rare bird. For one thing, it’s too hot most of the year (Delhi summers are notorious for wilting the most hardened traveller). For another, there are too many men, jostling and crowding each other, busying themselves with Typical Male Activities. Once twilight falls, who’s left on the streets but the male cigarette-vendor, the male chaiwalla? Men stake out their territory while women remain quietly at home, making dinner for their families.And yet I enjoy walking in Delhi. I make it a point to buy my own groceries from the store near my home. I walk in Old Delhi for an hour and reward myself with kebabs that I have to eat standing up in a crowded restaurant. In Lodi Gardens, where it is cooler, I watch peacocks in silhouette against the tomb of Sikandar Lodi. There are clandestine lovers cuddling in the bushes, and I stifle a smile – in India, lovers are always on a quest for privacy.Most of all, I enjoy walking at night, down the zigzag lanes of Hauz Khas Village or Green Park. I walk in whatever I like, refusing to defer to the convention that women dress modestly. Yes, there are male eyes on me, staring at my crop top. Often men are astonished at the things I do in public, like walking out to buy a bottle of wine.Well-behaved women do not walk on the Delhi roads at night. “It isn’t safe,” people whisper. But women who walk often know the joys of walking, and we will not be deprived. Whenever I visit a city, I like to explore on foot (I use a wheelchair full time but, like most disabled people, still use the phrase “on foot”). This is partly because of access – I’ve learnt getting around a city in a wheelchair is often much more enjoyable without having to rely on an inaccessible underground network or unreliable taxi firms (and with them, ramps and disgruntled drivers). But it’s as much because I’ve always thought there was something special about exploring a city as a pedestrian. When I’m visiting my sister in Newcastle, I’ll go everywhere by foot if possible. Little is said about how much of a treat it is to walk through, particularly along the Quayside. As a visitor, I spend much of my time there. I love how easy it is to leave the car behind and simply walk – to a bar, an art centre, restaurant, a concert hall. For a city known for its north-east chill, you could convince yourself there’s a holiday air about this strip.Famed for its multiple bridges, there’s something uniquely tranquil about walking along the bank of the river Tyne, seeing the rainbow arch of the Gateshead Millennium Bridge reflected across the surface of the water. Designed as a pedestrian and cycling bridge, it has the feel of infrastructure of a city genuinely made for the foot, with the sound of shoes on metallic flooring connecting workers, city break tourists, and locals to both sides of the river.In the evening I take a 30-minute wander past flats, offices and eateries accompanied by dog-walkers, restaurant dwellers, and the smattering of hen and stag do’s trickling over from the city centre. On a Sunday afternoon, I meander along the bankside market scattered with independent stallholders and arts and crafts.If the sun makes a showing, few things are better than strolling along the quayside at your own pace. If it doesn’t – just take a coat. Cairo isn’t a city that invites walking. Stepping outside my house often means weaving a path between roaring lanes of traffic and parked cars, across a busy street to try and to find space to walk. There’s the added problem of street harassment, which necessitates headphones and sometimes a quick glare. Walking along the Corniche, snaking along the Nile with its slippery new pink pavement, the wind and lingering stares constant slaps in the face, can feel like an achievement – even defiant.But finding a route for an enjoyable walk feels like being in possession of a delicious secret. Mine is strolling under the leafy canopy of the Garden City district, a labyrinthine sprawl of crumbling early 20th-century buildings. The knowing nod of familiarity from the friendly shoe-shiner on the corner, and the woman who tosses food down to the stray cats and dogs from her first-floor window, always give me a feeling of comfort.I’m also fond of ducking behind the Hussein Mosque near the Khan al Khalili market to wind between pedestrians and stalls of books and souvenirs on the unpaved road leading to the old bookbinding shop. A favourite short stroll near my house in the Zamalek neighbourhood is in a nursery garden under the 15th May bridge, tucked between the riverbank and the lanes of cars clogging the road that runs along the Nile. There I’m surrounded by towering succulents, and normally cave in to picking new plants from the rows of jasmine and cacti. Cairo can feel like a pressure cooker at street level, but its joys are tucked away in its corners, a short walk away.Living or working in areas of a city where the setting changes every few steps can be exhausting on the senses. But they provide an attractive backdrop for flânerie. In Portsmouth, the stone snake of the Millennium Promenade offers cliff-steep changes in landscape every few metres: old, new, wealth, poverty, art, industry, silence, skyscrapers looming above, water below.Discordant landscapes like these are especially rich in clues and signs, because every change becomes part of the city’s map. In the historical dockyard area, you don’t need to know the value of every property you pass to gauge its distance from the sea – just look at how the estate agent’s placards grow cleaner and shinier as the water draws closer.Cities like to pretend they have beaten off nature, but it creeps back in a way least expected. On the south-facing side of the street cheery gangs sit outside cafes and restaurants, but on the other side shop windows are boarded up. We gravitate to the sunny side of the street but this street-dining compass is the difference between boom and bust for proprietors. TV satellite dishes point close to south-east, which in Portsmouth means they hold a finger towards the direction the ferries will arrive. Those attuned to nature’s clues will spot the trees on the streets change from usual suspects to rarer salt-tolerant species, like oleasters, just before the sea appears.You can find a station by going against the thicker stream of crowds – people disembark as one mass from trains but find their way to them in drips. In all commuter cities there is a flow from stations in the morning and towards late afternoon. If you are really lost, you can ask a local for directions. Watch for someone who doesn’t pause before crossing the road – the better we know an area, the less time we spend at the pavement’s edge.Of course, a smartphone can reveal much of this. But using technology in these situations comes at great cost – not financial, but to the potential experience. The digital map reduces a city’s colours from a million to three and its sounds, smells and tastes to nil. It gives no sense of the fish markets and artists’ studios, the topless youths shouting sharp obscenities and the silent fishermen trying their luck, the fresh sea zephyrs and diesel fumes, greedy gulls’ cries and clanking anchor chains.As Sam Johnson didn’t say: when a person tires of their smartphone, they are ready for city life.

When I say campaign, I mean that I joked on Facebook that I should be the editor, not him. People took it seriously as though there were a remote possibility of this when everyone knows I am allergic to offices, don’t believe in meetings longer than 10 minutes and am the world’s crappest schmoozer.My credentials were simply that I loved that paper and did not want it edited by a racist misogynist, which is how I then perceived Liddle. The common assault on his pregnant girlfriend, for which he accepted a police caution but later denied, was public knowledge.Whatever part of the left Liddle claimed once to represent, his downtrodden man-of-the-people-libertarian-shtick was already apparent. He sent me some odd messages, called me “Suze”, slagged me off because I worked at the Mail on Sunday, which had claimed he left racist messages on football forums (some of which Liddle has denied).The best bit was that I had a party to celebrate NOT becoming editor of The Independent, a job that no one would ever offer me anyway, but this is the way I like to carry on in this carousel of nonsense that is the media.Liddle carried on, too, upping the ante in that now-familiar: “Will no one but brave little me talk about immigration?” tone. He moved such views right into the mainstream. Poison is what happens when you speak truth not to power, but to bait the powerless.It is neither funny nor clever, but it titillates the right’s intelligentsia in magazines such as the Spectator. The respectability of a periodical allows Liddle to now write: “I have spent the morning trying to draw a cartoon of a black person without it being racist. It’s bloody difficult. Especially the lips.” Puke-making. From web forum to the heart of the establishment (Muslim women as postboxes, anyone?) – the publication of racist and Islamophobic comments is now permitted.This didn’t happen overnight in a vacuum. We can crow all we like over Katie Hopkins’ recent financial troubles, but it doesn’t change the environment that allowed her to flourish. I lost track of when she went too far, of when she began freelancing for any far-right cause that would have her. She became the woman in the street, the woman who gets her facts wrong, who hates her own weakness so much that she turns her bile on to the very weakest.She does not have the smarts of Liddle. I say that without irony. He knows what he does she is a dumb opportunist. It was OK to call drowning migrants cockroaches. Editors let her do that just as the Spectator enables its “alt-right” bros. The mainstreaming of racist discourse manifests through Ukip, the EDL, the Yaxley-Lennon groupies – but it is made credible by print journalism, by adults saying things for which children would be reprimanded. To discuss the psyches of a Liddle or a Hopkins, who are just begging to be denounced by liberals, is for another day. White supremacy is reaching power in the US and neo-Nazis gather in Europe.We have witnessed full-blown racism becoming respectable as public discourse. Enablers of addicts allow them to escape the consequences of their actions. Editors have done this. So no, I don’t have the wherewithal to edit a paper, but I sure as hell know that these editorial decisions are nothing to do with free speech or even journalism. I would not publish this filth, that’s for sure.You’ve got to love Cerys Matthews staging a one-woman bit of class war on her BBC 6 Music show. She doesn’t want to play music from people who have been given the “leg-up” of going to private school. She would like to play music from a wider pool of people. She said, quite reasonably, that social mobility has stalled and that “we all have the onus on us to keep progress going to make sure all classes, all colours, all creeds, all genders get the opportunity to get where they need to be going. That’s not happening at the minute.”The charts are dominated by folk who went to private school. Just as acting is. Just as publishing is. Every time this is mentioned, some poor sap will say it’s not fair because children don’t get to choose where their parents sent them to school. The public-schoolchild cri de coeur is always: “Its not my fault, but I just happened to have an enormous amount of contacts as well as being supertalented.”Either culture, in the widest sense, represents all of us, or it is simply finishing school with a soundtrack. Certainly, culture failed to represent what was going on in this country, as Brexit seemed an utter shock to the entire artistic establishment.Of course, working-class artists break through and are then fetishised for their authenticity. It was ever thus. The fact that the dreadful Tory MP Philip Davies has called for Matthews’ resignation is a good sign. Seriously, has he nothing better to do?The idea that Cerys will not play Florence + the Machine, Coldplay and Clean Bandit but will play Nina Simone, Ghostpoet and David Bowie means she has not simply class, albeit of the wrong kind, but taste.Is anyone at the Lib Dem conference apart from some TV crews? Where even is it? I speak as someone who used to go to these things, for my sins. There was that rose-garden interlude of Clegg and Cameron, but now where is this flock of super-reasonable beings to find a leader? Gina Miller is there, talking about the End of Chaos, but chaos is at least exciting this is just collapse. The last time the Lib Dems entered my consciousness was when Hugh Grant, playing Jeremy Thorpe, told Norman Scott: “Hop on all fours.” Don’t tell Tim Farron."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53988bfd1a01940f57d336c3f161662890ce8587/0_391_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37632c51979fd58912e7569a78e859bd","title":"liberalism lib dems centre politics vince cable","story":"That reflects another failure: at a time when Jeremy\u0026nbspCorbyn has taken Labour radically to the left, and Theresa May’s agenda is dictated by the fanatical right, there must be room for a party of mainstream moderation.

They look peripheral even when they’re parked in the\u0026nbspmiddle of\u0026nbspthe road.The electoral system makes life hard for small parties, but that explains only how an appealing challenger would struggle to achieve an electoral breakthrough. It doesn’t explain why the Lib Dems don’t even appeal. And there are signs of appetite for alternatives.

It was an intellectual as well as a technocratic ambition. He saw liberalism as his party’s unique heritage and a quality that Labour and Tories were equally prone to neglect. There are indeed authoritarian impulses of left and right that manifest themselves when either side is allowed to monopolise power.In that context, the absence of a Lib Dem revival raises\u0026nbspan interesting question. Does their malaise say anything meaningful about the health of liberalism itself? And by\u0026nbspextension does a defence of liberal democracy require renewal of the party that named itself after the idea? Cable thinks it does. Well, he would, wouldn’t he, but there is a way to plot the Lib Dem rise and fall on a graph of bigger trends in British politics: the party was ascendant in the era of New Labour, when there was a high level of consensus around third-way economics and a generational flourishing of social-liberal values. The Tories, then cantankerous and reactionary, seemed\u0026nbspdoomed to atrophy on the cultural margin. They only regained power under David Cameron by tilting towards liberalism – a shift conceived originally as a question of tonal “modernisation”, and then enacted institutionally by reliance on Clegg’s MPs for a parliamentary majority.But the coalition hollowed out the political centre. Austerity fired the left’s appetite for socialism. The right felt betrayed by Cameron’s arrogant metropolitan style – his support for gay marriage his dismissal of Ukip as “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists”. By 2015 to 2016, Corbynism had captured Labour and Brexit-propelled nationalism had captured the Tories.To project the tumultuous events of recent years through a Lib Dem lens flatters the party’s significance, but it illuminates a problem for a wider tribe that feels politically adrift right now. They see the collapse of the liberal centre as a moral calamity: the ascendency of foul populism. But to insurgent forces of left and right, the centrist lament is just the nostalgia of a deposed, discredited elite. Liberals themselves don’t seem sure whether their business is restoration of the old order or rebellion against a new one.That dilemma is incarnate in the figure of Sir Vince. He has proposed reforms to open his party to loosely affiliated supporters – “a movement of moderates” – to counteract extreme polarisation of British politics. But his style radiates lethargic ancien régime self-pity. In fairness, Cable has recognised his incipient obsolescence and promised to stand down next year. His reforms hint also at recognition that the party’s brand might be beyond redemption. Renewal of the Lib Dems as a mass movement feels less probable than Lib Dem submersion into a wider force evolving from the vibrant ecosystem of grassroots anti-Brexit campaigns. In parliament, dissident Labour MPs are confident the Lib Dems will fold into any breakaway faction they might form.The mustering of a new force looks inevitable but not imminent. Partly that is because the menace that anxious liberals decry is still hypothetical for much of the country. Brexit looms, but hasn’t actually happened yet. The spectre of hard-left authoritarianism is a subject mostly discussed in the context of obscure internal Labour party machinations. Meanwhile, the concerns that have driven people away from the political centre are less abstract – immigration, wage stagnation, cuts to public services, feelings of neglect by political elites over many years. The liberal lament can sound ethereal compared to those grievances.That doesn’t mean that liberalism is secure. The peril of British politics being captured by its wilder fringes is real. The appetite for something neither Labour nor Tory is surely real too. But the rubble where the old centre ground collapsed doesn’t necessarily indicate the best spot to erect something new. Also, if there is the need for a mass movement to defend liberal democracy, it is a task far too important to leave in the incapable hands of the Liberal Democrats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22dba168d33c928249d19d65e4bb1e8677fcb0c4/0_120_5246_3148/master/5246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57d299837c588deea67af92fdd07e01c","title":"rich britons inequality poverty social wealth","story":"After decades in the background of political debate, income inequality has come front and centre in the fight over Britain’s future. According to a 2017 survey conducted by NatCen Social Research, more than two-thirds of Britons believe that government should reduce the gap between rich and poor. To the left, Jeremy Corbyn laments “grotesque inequality”, and to the right, Theresa May pledges to fight for the many, “not the privileged few”.This is the paradox of inequality in Britain: the wealth that is most unearned is the most politically protected. Parents and property remain the best predictors of life chances, but all the best policy tools for correcting this injustice remain off the table.This presents a problem – not only for households that have been locked out of wealth formation, but for Britain’s economy, society and politics as a whole. First, high levels of wealth inequality reduce the dynamism of the economy. This is certainly true at the bottom of the wealth distribution: the quarter of UK households that have no wealth or savings lack the security to take new risks or pursue new opportunities – be they in education or in business. But it is also true at the top: high house prices in cities such as Cambridge, Bristol and London reduce labour mobility and price younger workers out of home ownership, forcing them to live in cramped and expensive rental accommodation. In other words, the problem is not poverty, but inequality itself.Second, high levels of wealth inequality skew future social outcomes. With inheritance taxes very low and easy to avoid, property wealth is – to borrow a poetic phrase from John Major – likely to cascade down the generations. The rich will not just stay rich, but in all likelihood will get even richer: the bank of mum and dad financed a quarter of all UK mortgages in 2017. And the growing share of the unpropertied will fall further behind, with equal opportunity becoming a pipe dream.The danger is that the paradox of wealth inequality becomes self-reinforcing: as wealth at the top increases, the likelihood of redistributive reform decreases. The reason is that high levels of wealth inequality bias the democratic process. Martin Gilens has documented definitively the “elite economic domination” of American politics. But similar concerns about the unequal influence of the new aristocracy have been raised in Britain.The paradox puts progressives in a bind – good policy is bad politics. Should they fight political opinion, making the case for taxes on land and inheritance, but in new clothes? Or should they leave well alone, in favour of more popular, if less effective, policies?One solution floating around these days is to revive so-called asset-based welfare policy. Everyone loves owning a house: if progressives want both to help poor people and to increase their popularity, then they should help low-income renters to buy their own homes.But while subsidising home ownership is an effective tool for boosting private wealth accumulation, it is unlikely to solve the problem of inequality. For while the house price boom of the 1990s and early 2000s enriched millions of property owners, it also impoverished property renters. Asset-based welfare policies provide no solutions to the challenges of today’s market. The government could, as with help-to-buy, subsidise renters to buy their own home – but this would further boost demand and hence prices, leaving lower-income renters even deeper in the lurch. Or it could subsidise developers to build more homes – but there is little evidence that new supply would bring down overall prices.The real way forward, then, is not to subsidise private property wealth – which is a largely zero-sum exercise – but to invest in social wealth. This will free households to work, retrain and take risks, in the process enabling them to accumulate private financial assets. Britain should focus one three types of social investment.One is social housing: the government has spent more than £190bn in housing benefit since 2010 – a whopping sum – draining social wealth into private hands. These funds could be redirected toward the acquisition of public land and construction of social housing.Another is education: skills retraining is crucial to labour market success, but most unskilled households lack the resources to invest in themselves. One solution could be for the government to establish an “opportunity fund” for each child, which can be spent on training and costs associated with it.And a third is childcare: low-income households, especially those headed by single mothers, are often unable to work – let alone train – because of the prohibitive costs of childcare. Britain should follow the example of other European countries and roll out universal childcare provision, a uniquely important form of social wealth.Investing in risk-deflecting social wealth would reduce overall levels of inequality in a long-term, sustainable way. New social investment would free unpropertied households to pursue opportunities without fear of falling through the net and losing the roof over their heads. The best part, though, is the popularity of such policies. Seven out of 10 people want more spending on schools. And six out of 10 people would be prepared to pay more tax to increase NHS spending. A similar number support more spending on affordable housing.Effective taxes on inheritance and wealth are not coming any time soon. But we can start the process of rebuilding our common wealth today. The end of austerity and the start of a social investment campaign is a winning platform.• Simon Tilford is chief economist of the Centre for European Reform"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cb03d54ce7fe7b795924245fe62467483b9eded/0_49_4554_2733/master/4554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de4550f66343f54310221f7000f25a3c","title":"steve mcqueen photograph every year 3 pupil london art project tate britain","story":"About 115,000 children in 2,410 schools invited to take part in Tate Britain project The Oscar-winning film-maker and artist Steve McQueen is to create a portrait of thousands of schoolchildren from across London in a work described by its backers as one of the world’s most ambitious art projects.The photographs aim to capture the nerves and excitement of the 115,000 year 3 pupils starting their academic year in the capital. All 2,410 primary schools in London have been invited to register over the next nine months.McQueen plans to take a traditional school photograph, with rows of seven-year-olds positioned next to their teachers or teaching assistants. The resulting images will be displayed in Tate Britain’s Duveen galleries between November 2019 and May 2020.The project is a partnership between Tate Britain, ArtAngel, the creative learning specialists A New Direction and McQueen, who was a Turner prize-winning artist before directing films including 12 Years a Slave, for which he won the 2014 Academy award for best picture.The organisers of the project said: “It will be a celebration of the tens of thousands of young people who will make London their own in years to come, and a meditation on the social forces and personal developments that shape our lives.“The work will embody the ersity of the city in which the artist grew up, as well as the potential of the next generation who will shape London’s future”.Artangel, a commissioning organisation that stages work in unexpected places, will create an outdoor exhibition of class photographs in each of London’s 33 boroughs.To coincide with the project, an exhibition of McQueen’s work will be at the Tate Modern from February until May 2020.Primary schools in the capital with year 3 pupils can register at tateyear3project.org.uk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6611187b68b9948ccc637c1fb9df1410416f1780/0_223_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6af3ce2a198d15e9f2355cc2793f67cc","title":"end education snobbery labour angela rayner","story":"For Angela Rayner, giving every child the best chance is personal – her mother couldn’t read. Now Rayner has a blank sheet to draw up Labour’s ‘NHS for education’ Angela Rayner, shadow education secretary, MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, former careworker, trade unionist, mother-of-three and grandmother-of-one, is seated in her office in Westminster, ready and waiting for our interview. She is impeccably well prepared (notes in front of her, hair smoothed back into a high ponytail) and she speaks at a rate of knots as we romp through the education litany of free schools and academies, Sure Start, “off-rolling”, tuition fees and more.We are meeting because in less than a week she will deliver a speech at the Labour conference in which she is expected to flesh out the party’s plans for a national education service (NES) in England. It will be an important moment for Rayner. While Labour’s promise to abolish tuition fees is likely to be the big vote-winner, its “NHS for education” has quietly become its big education idea – and Jeremy Corbyn has placed it in her hands.“It’s really exciting for me,” she says, fizzing with enthusiasm. “We’ll immediately end the cuts and start putting money back into the education system. We’ll return to free higher and further education. We’ll sort out public sector pay and restore morale by working with people rather than treating them as the enemy.”Although she has been in parliament for only three years and in the education role for two, Rayner is on to her third Conservative education secretary. “I started with a blank piece of paper from Jeremy saying: build a national education service. You can either be daunted or you can see it as an incredible opportunity.”Rayner does not appear to be daunted by much. After a difficult start in life on a council estate in Stockport, the challenges of a political career in Westminster hold little fear for her. Her family was poor, her mother could not read or write, and Rayner left school without qualifications, got pregnant at 16 and left home to raise her son.“There were bigger things in my life than whether or not I was going to sit through 50 minutes of a history lesson that was so abstract it meant nothing to me.” Her politics are driven by her life experience, which has given her an intimate understanding of poverty and deprivation – rare in Westminster.Rayner’s eldest son is now 22 and a father himself her youngest is nine and “a model student” her middle child, who was born prematurely, is registered blind and has special educational needs.“One of my biggest fears at the moment is my 10-year-old growing up in an environment that says he’s not good enough. I go to his parents’ evening and I’m told he’s not meeting his required standard.“I was told four times he would die. I was told he would be severely disabled and would need 24-hour care. The fact that he walks into school and accesses the curriculum to me is an absolute miracle. He’s an inspiration.“I want the schools to nurture him and for him to reach his full potential. I don’t want a rigid system that says you’re not going to be a grade-A student so we need to off-roll you. I think that’s how many parents feel at the moment.”Rayner’s love of learning was awoken at a further education college with a sign language course a level\u0026nbsp2 qualification in care followed while working as a home-help with the elderly and she joined Unison, becoming a full-time union official in her early 20s. In 2015 she was elected to parliament and is now talked about as a possible successor to Corbyn to lead the Labour party.At the despatch box, Rayner is combative and highly effective in her criticisms of government education policy. In person, she is warm and likeable. Ask her about Labour’s plans for education and she lists all that’s gone wrong under the Tories: increasing class sizes, a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention, the thousand Sure Start centres lost, a 30-hour free childcare programme that misses those most in need.She’s appalled by the financial scandals eroding confidence in some academy chains and horrified by the growing numbers of children being “off-rolled” by schools to boost their league table results. She laments the narrowing of the curriculum, the lack of local accountability in academies and the money wasted on the government’s flagship free school programme.She reiterates earlier promises on restoring Sure Start funding and extending the early years childcare offer to all two- to four-years-olds, but is disappointingly limited in what she will say on the detail of the new NES. Maybe it isn’t there yet or she’s saving it for next week’s speech in Liverpool. “I’m going to have a lot to say at conference specifically about how we take the NES forward,” she tells me, “how we create an environment where it’s about collaboration, it’s about excellence, it’s about every child having an opportunity, and every person being able to fulfil their dreams as part of a comprehensive NES.”For many on the left she may not be radical enough. On private schools, Labour has promised to remove VAT exemption but Rayner has no appetite for abolishing them. “The way I want to try and end private schools is by making our national education service so good you wouldn’t want to waste your money.”Asked whether Labour would scrap the government’s controversial free schools policy or reverse the academies programme, she says watch this space. “What I’m trying to get away from is being ideologically driven. Rather than saying ‘all academies are bad, all community schools are good’, we’re saying, what are the key ingredients to making a school good?”On whether Labour will seek to return schools to local authority control, she says she’s looking at all the options. “There are clear gaps around accountability, there are clear gaps around democracy and democratic control of schools that I want to address.”And though she’s proud of Labour’s commitment to scrap tuition fees, she thinks everyone is far too preoccupied with going to university. Rayner’s eldest son did a level\u0026nbsp3 in motor mechanics. “I don’t see an out of work brickie at the moment, and the sparkies are doing really well,” she says. “I think technical education and vocational skills and having a trade mean something. It’s not grubby manual people, it’s like really valuable skills and yet there’s too much snobbery around it still.“People are still programmed to think that if your child doesn’t get straight As, get A-levels and go to a Russell Group university, that somehow they are not going to achieve in life. I think that’s sad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e05e883117030da109140c4a8f00b9878e441e0/0_465_4032_2418/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5a8e3e9c4f6c7429459b8e5654c914f","title":"from hairclips to hiking boots headline news for autumnwinter 2018","story":"Want to keep pace with the style pack this season? Be inspired by these four trends that will show you know your Gucci from your Prabal GurungSometimes a trend comes along that is reassuringly familiar, something everyone can get on board with. For autumnwinter 2018, that’s hair clips. While barrettes have been making their way back on to catwalks for a couple of seasons (hello, Ashley Williams and Simone Rocha), AW18 owns the claw, butterfly and comb variety. Think of the kind found on those often overlooked racks in your local chemist. At the shows, Alexander Wang had hair stylist Guido Palau slick back models’ hair into metallic banana claws stamped with the designer’s logo, while Prabal Gurung revived the comb hairband, pulling back models’ hair in a zigzag line. New talent Faustine Steinmetz also went all out. Her models wore embellished slides, brown combs, tortoiseshell clasps and butterfly grips, sometimes all at once.The appeal of this trend is twofold: first, the popular 90s nostalgia it evokes. Jennifer Aniston and the Olsens were partial to a plastic clip and, like chokers and tiny sunglasses before them, they’re instantly synonymous with the decade. Second, chemist clips are simple, fuss-free, yet spell cool in a second. Think of it as a style prescription.You’ve probably worn one at some stage, whether to the gym, work or when doing a spot of DIY. Favoured by busy women on TV from Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City to Kat Edison in The Bold Type, it’s the easiest way to look pulled together when you have no time at all. But this season the topknot has fashion approval. The majority of the 81 models at the Chanel show wore topknots, adding a grown-up, purposeful vibe to a catwalk that cast models as very chic dog walkers, striding through autumn leaves against a backdrop of real trees.How to achieve the look? Sweep your hair into a high ponytail on the crown of your head using a paddle brush. Then wrap the ponytail around into a bun, securing it with a bobby pin. The height of the bun – from nape of neck to crown of the head – will dictate whether you look chilled out or slick. In busy people semantics, high on your head is hair code for “don’t mess”, while nape is more “errands on a weekend, brunch afterwards”. And the best bit? We estimate it will require around one minute, 20 seconds of your morning routine.Sportswear on the catwalk is not new, but there are nuances that keep it fresh, so the sight of hiking boots is worth noting. At House of Holland they were thuggish, black and spiked at Prada subtler, with toggles attached to insteps. At Gucci they were both ugly and beautiful, had jewel straps and – whisper it – bordered on the practical. But best not to traverse the Alps in a pair.What to make of the fact that balaclavas are having a fashion moment? Named after the town where British troops wore the knitted headgear to protect them from the cold during the Crimean war, they have moved away from the military, or the more modern associations of B-movie heists, to the catwalk. Most models at Calvin Klein’s show wore a balaclava, some of which had a homespun vibe that resembled the kind of knitwear your great aunt might give you for Christmas. At Richard Quinn, meanwhile, the balaclava had an appointment with the Queen. The young British designer, who had Her Majesty in the flesh front row at his London fashion week show, had models wearing floral dresses, some of their faces covered in matching floral balaclavas. Think of it as a club kid-meets-Balmoral look. And feel free to adopt it when you don’t feel like facing the world.

To her surprise, people began following. Today, with more than 50,000 followers, she makes up part of the growing acne positivity movement.After years of oppressive aesthetic perfection, acne positivity is a drive for people to be more open about their skin problems, from the occasional spot to full-blown cystic acne. It joins recent moves to celebrate the many and varied appearances of our skin – from vitiligo to freckles and stretch marks – but also seeks to educate those who still believe that acne is a problem for the unwashed and unhealthy.Many trace the movement back to the British blogger Em Ford, who in 2015 posted a YouTube video called You Look Disgusting. It showed her both in full makeup and bare-faced with her acne visible, as a succession of comments people had posted about her skin sprung up around her: “WTF is wrong with her face?”, “I can’t even look at her”, “Ewww, gross, horrible, ugly …”. In the first week alone, it amassed 10 million views. Ford, whose YouTube channel My Pale Skin now has more than one million subscribers, will shortly launch You Look Disgusting 2.0.Others have followed, including the Colorado Instagrammer Hailey Wait and the British beauty blogger Kadeeja Khan, as well as a host of celebrities – from Kylie Jenner promoting her favourite spot treatment to Justin Bieber’s Instagram post that claimed “Pimples are in” and Lorde’s sardonic replies to people giving her unsolicited skincare advice. Last year, Teen Vogue launched the inaugural Acne awards.Kushner developed acne in high school. “Whiteheads, blackheads, the usual stuff.” It was around the age of 20 that she developed adult cystic acne. “It was hard. And extremely painful. I had no idea what was going with my skin. Nothing worked. Or if it did, it didn’t for long.”She grew increasingly socially anxious, certain that everyone she met was staring at her skin. “One time I remember I was talking to my friend in class and started laughing at a joke she told me. As I was laughing, a cyst burst open and started bleeding down my face. It was horrifyingly embarrassing. I ran out of the classroom and didn’t come back for the next two weeks.”Dr Bav Shergill of the British Association of Dermatologists says that acne “often affects people without much power in society, such as adolescents”. He tells of a US study in which participants were shown a selection of photographs of high-school students with skin problems, as well as photographs of the same students with their acne airbrushed out, and asked for their impressions. The results, Shergill says, showed that “as soon as you have any disfigurement on your face, you get viewed as an introverted nerd”. Corrinne, an educational psychologist from Folkestone, turned 40 in August. To celebrate, she visited the Mac Cosmetics counter for a makeover. Sitting before the makeup artist, she felt horribly, painfully exposed. “I couldn’t make eye contact,” she says. “To sit there with my face naked, I felt so vulnerable.”Every morning, Corrinne dedicates an hour to the process of getting ready, with the bulk of that time set aside for makeup. She will use a base, foundation, concealer, then more foundation, then powder, then a spray to fix it. It is not an attempt to look unfailingly glamorous: “I’m just trying to get myself to a baseline to face the world.”It has been like this since she was 14. At school, she would wear makeup so thick it was “almost a mask”. She hated to be seen in daylight and would use a tiny vanity mirror rather than something that showed her whole face or full length. She spent an hour and a half getting ready for school each morning, and at lunchtime she would go home to reapply her foundation. At breaktimes, she would head straight to the toilets to check her concealer. Comments were made that she says shaped her. “I remember someone said I’d put so much make-up on, it looked like Polyfilla.“Without social media, it was isolating, lonely, secretive. I thought I was acne. I thought I wasn’t bigger than that.”In her 20s, she met a friend who had also suffered from severe acne. To find someone who understood so fully, who would discuss it openly and felt no shame, was hugely helpful to Corrinne – it was a taste, perhaps, of today’s acne positive attitude. “I wish we’d had that movement when I was 14,” she says. “I think it’s a fantastic thing.”When Kushner began her Instagram account in 2015, it was solely for herself – a private page to track her progress on Accutane. “I wasn’t really interested in sharing my journey at first because I didn’t realise that others were going through the same thing,” she explains. “I wanted to document my skin and side-effects so that I could look back on it and see how far I’ve come.”When she made her page public, it was an act of defiance. “If anything, my account was a rebellion against the typical beauty blogger accounts at the time,” she says. “There was no curation taking place, no filters, angles, and certainly no Photoshop. I would take out my phone, take a picture, think of a caption within four or five minutes and post it. It was and always has been about keeping it real. It was a call against stereotypical standards of beauty, saying that you don’t need XYZ to be beautiful. All you need is you.”This attitude has now spread to other previously flawless areas of social media. Jessica Olie is a fitness guru known for her Let’s Start Yoga ebook and an Instagram account in which she is often photographed holding yoga poses in charming locations around the globe. A year or so ago, Olie’s account broke its carefully calibrated perfection in favour of a new kind of honesty, documenting her orce, her father’s illness and her problems with her skin.Olie suffered from teenage acne, exacerbated by the constant exposure to chlorine as a competitive swimmer, and in her late teens was prescribed the pill. Five months after she stopped taking the contraceptive last year, her skin went “haywire” – worse, she says, than when she was a teenager.For someone who makes a living out of looking enviably, radiantly healthy, posting honestly about her skin problems came with a degree of risk. “If someone said: ‘You’re supposed to be healthy, why is your skin bad?’, I’d tell them just because you’re healthy it doesn’t mean your skin is good, and just because your skin is good it doesn’t mean you’re healthy.”And the pursuit of perfection can be wearisome. “I think I was fed up of not feeling pretty or beautiful enough because I had a few pimples. I looked at my friends who didn’t wear makeup and I realised when they had pimples they still looked beautiful.” Today, she posts pictures and videos of herself makeup-free, her skin mid-flare or masked by splodges of spot cream. “People put you on a pedestal, they think everything in your life is perfect, so it’s nice when people on social media reveal there are things they don’t feel confident about.”Kushner, too, has felt a shift in attitudes. “Honestly, there hasn’t been as much backlash as you would think,” she says. “At first, definitely. People will always have something negative to say no matter what you do or post or say, so that’s important to keep in mind. But now I feel like our little community has been able to educate those who were once ignorant on the subject. It feels like a more understanding and accepting place than it was four years ago. I only hope that it continues to grow and the community continues to shine its light.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29d174584be3813662e07046d93b918584fe4705/0_0_2100_1500/master/2100.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=84106d50af0e0fa29334a30d5114f03a 2020w","title":"hollywoods heroes more muscular mark wahlberg the rock","story":"From Mark Wahlberg to The Rock, America’s cinema strongmen have increasingly big biceps – is it something to do with waning power? If global politics had left you in any doubt, the commotion caused by Mark Wahlberg last week confirmed that we are truly in the age of the strongman. The publication of the actor’s daily routine – which includes two gym sessions, six meals and one hour cultivating his torso in a cryogenic recovery chamber – confirmed what many of us had suspected for some time: a man’s cultural worth these days can be accurately gauged by the circumference of his biceps.Telltale evidence had already arrived last year, when the eighth film in the Fast and Furious series shattered the global box-office record for an opening weekend, taking an absurd half a billion dollars in three days. That would be the Fast and Furious series fronted by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Vin Diesel, two men whose pre-Hollywood years were spent as pro wrestler and nightclub bouncer respectively, and whose current whey-powered incarnations make pipsqueaks of their former selves.Together, this trinity of weights-room warriors have racked up nearly $10bn worth of ticket sales in the US alone. If you were feeling unsure about a society that chooses a showbiz star as its president, how about one whose cultural icons look more like cartoon characters than people? Strange times indeed – made even stranger by the fact that we’ve been here before.If the 70s’ action icons were Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman and Charles Bronson – hard-drinking, normal-looking guys whose morals were strewn with shades of grey – the following decade flipped the formula: you may have rightly wondered how Arnie and co got so pumped, but you never had reason to question their cause. And they were well-oiled in only the most literal sense.A cursory scan of some video-box taglines from the era (samples include “Crime is a disease. Meet the cure” and “Heroes never die. They just reload”) give a basic impression of the level of nuance on offer. Generally speaking, these movies opted for the profane over the profound. In an age when American inidualism reigned supreme, these were straightforward stories of one man saving the day. And “man” is the operative word – it was the actors’ hulking physiques, torsos bared at every turn, that were the stars of the show. These films might have drooled over firearms, but not half as much as they drooled over human arms.Fast-forward three decades, as a gun-toting Wahlberg looms over us from roadside billboards, and it’s tempting to conclude that we’ve come full circle. Why the renewed urge to thrust these oversized muscle-men on to our screens? It’s almost as if America is trying to make up for something. After all, the goliaths of the 80s were largely there to prove a point in the wake of Vietnam: Rambo, Commando, Predator and the rest all delivered thinly veiled restagings of what had been a disastrous war, only this time America’s cigar-chomping heroes emerged from the jungle triumphant.There are no wars to refight these days, but that’s not to say Uncle Sam doesn’t still harbour an inferiority complex or two. Perhaps in an era of waning US economic clout – and vanishing political dignity, thanks to you-know-who – Wahlberg and co are here to compensate. To make America pump weights again.Or perhaps that’s too easy a reading. Because it’s not quite right to label the current crop of strongmen as spiritual heirs to their 80s predecessors: while Schwarzenegger and Stallone were all about the bloodshed and bravado, these guys tend to deliver their heroism with a nod and a wink, even a hug. The screen personas honed by Diesel and Johnson in particular are deliberately goofy and warm-hearted (if there’s one thing the Fast and Furious films adore more than a city-decimating street-race, it’s an earnest heart-to-heart over a couple of cold Coronas), although that probably says less about the current zeitgeist than the scramble for mass appeal that has taken over Marvel-era Hollywood. They just don’t exterminate ’em like they used to.Not often, anyway. Wahlberg’s series of save-the-day tales made with Peter Berg are perhaps the closest in spirit to the alpha-dog adventures of the 80s. Mile 22 is the latest of these and you sense that the film, whose plot follows an elite paramilitary task force escorting a shady south Asian operative back to US soil, will have Stallone and co nodding approvingly, trigger-fingers stiffening with excitement.Either way, we can safely say that America’s appetite for these herculean heroes endures. Which counts as mission accomplished for the men of yesteryear, whose simple ambitions were laid out by John Rambo all the way back in 1985: “All I want is for our country to love us as much as we love it! That’s all I want!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/806997ebe1af10abe66466da36d109eac3ad1580/0_1652_4855_2911/master/4855.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d63f85001c0be1083a9628e888db8c2d","title":"nigel slater sardines with tomato and orange recipe","story":"A tasty, zesty and quick to cook fish dishYou will need 3 or 4 sardines per person depending on their size.

But the secrets they can reveal can split families and leave users traumatisedThe first surprise of Michèle’s DNA test was how much saliva it took. “It was daunting. It took us, like, 20 minutes. And the more we laughed, the harder it was to do.”It was May 2016, and she and her now husband had ordered the kits as very early Christmas presents for themselves. They had been researching their family trees – Michèle had traced her father’s family back as far as the 1600s – and had wanted to test their DNA but had been put off by the cost. They were saving for a fertility treatment and had only recently moved to Florida from New York.But Michèle was considering going back to study, and she had been told she had some Native American blood on her father’s side – maybe if she could say how much, she figured, she would be eligible for scholarships. And so she and her husband came to be cracking up, spitting into their inidual vials. “We joked about sending them sweetener samples, to see if it still works.”In bed one night six weeks later, they pulled up the results from AncestryDNA on the laptop. They were impressed by the news about Michèle’s husband, which mostly reflected what he had always been told about his family. Then they opened Michèle’s results. “The first thing that popped up is a pie chart, and one whole half was red and said ‘Italy’.“I was dumbfounded. Like: ‘Well, that’s a huge mistake. They must have mixed mine up with someone else’s.’” She laughs, but you can hear it is hard-won. “My husband looks through it, then he says: ‘Honey, they didn’t make a mistake. This is you.’” That night, Michèle had her first ever anxiety attack.Recently DNA testing – once only accessible to doctors and detectives – has been extended to anyone curious about where they came from and willing to spend the best part of £100 to find out. Since launching in May 2012, AncestryDNA says it has tested more than 10 million people in 30 countries. 23andMe says it has more than 5 million subscribers FamilyTreeDNA claims 2 million.All of them are racing to grow their databases and their accuracy. AncestryDNA is especially visible, sponsoring the television programme Long Lost Family and running expensive adverts inviting people to discover their inner Viking (“This sword is your history”) or their innate links to the EU post-Brexit.It all sounds harmless, until you learn that as well as revealing customers’ ethnic origins, many DNA tests will also identify relatives in the companies’ databases. This “DNA-matching” can throw up previously unknown or unacknowledged brothers and sisters, cousins, uncles and aunts … or even reveal that the man you call dad is not your biological father. This is one reason that the UK’s Human Fertility and Embryology Authority is now calling on DNA testing services to warn customers about the possible emotional fallout.The kits that screen for genetic health risks can deliver equally devastating results. Yet all of these tests are typically taken in a spirit of casual curiosity. People are not prepared to have their lives rocked by what they may find out.As her results sank in, Michèle says: “I just got very quiet. All these things from my past suddenly started going through my head: questions, feelings, things that couldn’t be explained, things that my mother would get angry or defensive about if I brought them up. I started to realise: ‘I think I’ve discovered a secret.’”That night, she called her estranged mother, breaking their two-year silence. She strenuously denied any knowledge of Italian ancestry – and still Michèle thought there might have been a mistake. AncestryDNA’s database showed her as having first cousins in Syracuse, NY, where she had grown up, with an Italian surname she did not recognise.“I stood up, my laptop went to the floor, I dropped my phone and I ran to the bathroom and started vomiting.”In a series of text messages, Michèle’s mother furiously denied that her prom date was Michèle’s father, adding (Michèle says) that “it wouldn’t matter anyway”, since he had died in a motorcycle accident the previous year. “That’s how I found that out. It was very cruel.” Michèle found his obituary online, accompanied by a photo of a man with dark hair and olive skin. “It was literally the male version of me.”A subsequent paternity test of the man she had thought was her father confirmed that there was no relation. “That was devastating for both of us,” says Michèle. He had not figured in her life when she was growing up, and they had only recently reconnected. She had moved to Florida in part to be closer to him.Despite the absence of blood ties, he remains very much in Michèle’s life paradoxically, she says, the discovery made their relationship stronger. But she has severed all ties with her mother who, three years on, continues to deny the results of three DNA tests.Michèle’s story may sound dramatic, but it is not unique. Increasingly, DNA tests are bringing to light infidelities, adoptions, cover-ups and lies that have been concealed for decades.There have been cases of people learning that they were conceived from donated sperm or even that they were switched at birth, says genealogist Debbie Kennett. “There have been a lot of secrets covered up in the past, and they are starting to come out.”Last year, AncestryDNA made matches opt-in to comply with data retention legislation keeping a “can of worms” shut may have been an added bonus, Kennett suggests. The company says that while almost every customer encounters surprises on their “self-discovery journey”, these are mostly “exciting and enriching” for those with “more sensitive queries”, there is a dedicated team of experienced staff. Likewise, 23AndMe says it had specially trained customer-care representatives.“When people get these unexpected findings, they tend to distrust the science at first,” says Kennett. “But even close matches can only reveal so much in isolation. The DNA on its own doesn’t give the science – you need the contextual family information as well.”When, in June, Kathy Piercy was contacted by a woman claiming to be her first cousin, she was initially sceptical. “I thought: ‘Yeah, right – I know all my cousins.’ But there’s no doubting DNA.” She had joined AncestryDNA four months earlier to find out more about her ancestors’ journey from Ireland to New Zealand, where she lives “on a dusty road out the back of nowhere” in the rural Canterbury region. “In New Zealand and Australia, we’ve got different bits and pieces in us, so it’s more relevant. I wasn’t looking for anything in particular, because I didn’t know there was anything to find.”But Judy Poole did. Raised by adoptive parents, as an adult she forged a tenuous relationship with her biological mother, who refused to discuss her father’s identity. She had sent her sample to AncestryDNA in April hoping that it might throw up clues, but was not at all expectant. Kathy was listed as her first cousin. After some back and forth and “a bit of maths”, says Kathy, they pieced together that her father was Kathy’s uncle, who at 19 had had a fling before his marriage. He died in 2012. “Whether he knew of Judy’s existence, we will never know,” says Kathy. But she was able to put Judy in touch with his son, her half-brother – “and he was over the moon to have a big sister”, she says.Judy was taken aback by their instant connection – not to mention the physical resemblance. “I really do look like Kathy. I’ve got my father’s eyes.” She did not have an especially happy childhood, she says, so to have gained a new family has been “really special”. “If anything, you start losing relationships in later life – but I think what I really got out of spending time together was that I felt valued.” She adds: “That’s probably something that hasn’t been in my life before.”The finding has caused tension within House’s family, and some members continue to doubt it. That is the risk with DNA tests, she says: not everyone is ready to learn that what they believe to be true, is not – especially secondhand. “You don’t have to have tested yourself to discover that your father is not your father.” And as more DNA is added to the database, you could be in store for more surprises.Daily activity in an AncestryDNA community on Facebook highlights how easily they are uncovered. “Why does my sister show as a close family member or first cousin?” someone posted recently “Half sisters,” was the reply, “sorry if u didn’t know.” Another user posted about finding her father in less than 24 hours of getting her results: “I’m the happiest girl in the world right now … He didn’t even know I existed.”House says there needs to be more advice about how to approach those difficult conversations – it could even be included with the test kit. “People are being flung into these situations that are ethically extremely complicated and perhaps stressful, and they need to be able to manage it.“Anything they find out will have implications for their family. The advert that says ‘I spat in a tube and discovered I was a Viking’ does not give any sense that that is the situation you may find yourself in.”With tests that offer health screening, even surprises you have signed up for can have life-altering consequences. For example, 23andMe screens for genetic risk of diseases including Parkinson’s and late-onset Alzheimer’s, as well as whether you are a carrier for cystic fibrosis, among other conditions.Seven months later, in March this year, Altschule received an email from 23andMe, saying it had just been approved to test for three BRCA gene mutations linked to an increased hereditary risk of breast cancer. She opted in: “I believe that knowledge is power.” The results returned positive for the same BRCA 2 variant carried by her father’s cousin, who had gone on to develop cancer. The next working day she took a printout to a genetic counsellor.To get that email, she says, “is really scary and overwhelming – it’s different from a person walking you through it”. But it was also accessible. Being Ashkenazi Jewish, her risk of having such a mutation was about one in 40, which she did not know before she was diagnosed. “At first it doesn’t feel as if it’s good news, but I look at it this way: now I can take charge of my health.”She credits 23andMe’s testing with saving her life, although, she adds, it is hardly exhaustive, even for the conditions it does assess. “In reality, I probably have so many chances of developing so many things that the test doesn’t test for.” (A spokesperson for 23andMe stressed that it was not a diagnostic test, and that the many steps involved meant “the customer should be fully informed of what all the possible outcomes of the report might be, before they have even sent off their kit for testing”.)Asked if she would have agreed to be tested for a condition that she was powerless to prevent or reduce her chances of developing, Altschule isn’t sure. “If there’s nothing you can do about it, I don’t think it would be helpful.” But she seems to reconsider mid-answer. “It would definitely be hard – but if you have that information, I think any person just wants to know. But you have to be ready for the answer.”In August 2016, not three months after she had sent off her saliva sample, Michèle flew to New York to visit 80 family members she had never met. Michèle’s grandmother was delighted to meet her, her only granddaughter – and even more so to learn that she was pregnant. Her uncle took her to see her father’s grave.She remembers her four-day visit as overwhelming, exhausting and surreal. “It took me at least a couple of weeks to recover,” she says. “But they welcomed me with open arms.”Despite all that she has gained as a result – self-knowledge, a family – Michèle remains ambivalent about her “traumatic” discovery. “There have been times when I’m just kind of breaking down, and so angry and sad, that I say I wish I had never opened Pandora’s box,” she says, tearfully. Therapy, writing and, in particular, the birth of her daughter have helped her to move on.A few weeks ago, she felt able to return to AncestryDNA, for the first time in two-and-a-half years. On logging in, she was told her ethnicity results had been updated. She was gripped by a sudden fear: what if it really had been all a mistake?But, she says with a snort: “I was even more Italian than I’d thought I was.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51b96123e780e1087b42278f53918abe769ecb44/0_123_4923_2953/master/4923.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=987f872eb028ef22949523f86cc84c04","title":"judas priests kk downing interview heavy duty memoir","story":"In a frank new memoir, the guitarist opens up about his time with the metal band and how boiling tensions caused him to leaveEverything about the image of Judas Priest communicates cooperation and unity. They’re five men in leather and studs, who barrel through a finely calibrated brand of heavy metal, highlighted by two lead guitarists who found a trademark by mirroring each other’s key riffs precisely.According to one of those guitarists, however, the inner workings of the band represent the precise inverse of that image, creating a parallel history of resentment and suspicion. KK Downing has written a new memoir, Heavy Duty: Days and Nights in Judas Priest, which challenges the narrative of one of the world’s most storied heavy metal bands, while giving frank explanations for why, after 41 years as a Priest loyalist, he left in a huff in 2011. “If you load too many things on to a person’s plate,” the 66-year-old Downing said, “at some point they’re going to drop it.”One of the main loads he bore concerned his relationship with fellow lead guitarist Glenn Tipton. While their playing in the studio showed exceptional rapport, as people they hadn’t an ounce of it – not even when they met back in 1974. “I never found Glenn to be particularly easy to get along with,” Downing writes. “Very early on, I was fully aware of the limited conditions under which he operated. If you were going to relate to him, you would do so entirely on his terms.”The disconnect between the men rippled into a multitude of fissures which eventually caused Downing’s relationship with the band to crumble. His book chronicles a history of slights, including key management decisions that excluded him, a ision of labor in the solos that disfavored him, and an official history that downplayed his key role in the group’s creation.Contacted by email, the band’s manager, Jayne Andrews, wrote that the current members of Judas Priest would have no comment on Downing’s view.“I felt I was in crisis,” the guitarist says of his decision to leave the band. “Whether it sounds selfish or not, everything seems to go out of the window in a crisis.”When discussing his decision to leave, Downing sounded somewhat more conflicted than he did in the book. He also made sure to stress how much he respects the other band members’ musicianship, as well as how fervently he honors their mutual legacy. More, he said he feels the book is fair and that, if his fellow Priests read it, they won’t be surprised by either his interpretations of various events or his feelings about them. Downing even thinks the book may do the band a service. “It’s putting their names out there,” he said. “Fans like to read about the ups and downs. It can’t all be good, can it?”It remains to be seen if the other members agree. Regardless, Downing hardly confines himself to pointing fingers at others, either in conversation or in the book. His prose (composed with writer Mark Eglinton) illuminates the many factors from his past which shaped his personality and which later contributed to the dysfunction within the band. Growing up in a rough neighborhood in West Bromwich, Downing’s home life was scarred by a father who suffered from paranoia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, germaphobia and gambling issues, and a mother who suffered from a rare metabolic psychological disorder. As a result, he developed a poor self-image, rendering him unexpressive and unassertive. Even so, the man born Kenneth Downing had a strong determination to make it as a musician from an early age. Growing up, his influences went way beyond metal. “I wanted to play jazz, so I listened to George Benson,” he said. “I also loved the classical guitar player John Mills and Chopin. I wanted to be able to play it all.”Still, Hendrix became his primary role model. “Before I ever heard the first Black Sabbath album, I had witnessed the great Jimi Hendrix play what I consider to be heavy metal,” he said. “That sound was there in Foxy Lady and Purple Haze. Then, Hendrix was sadly gone and somebody needed to take that forward.”The first musicians to use the name Judas Priest (an allusion to a song from Bob Dylan’s John Wesley Harding album) featured none of those found in the lineup fans came to know. Downing, and bassist Ian Hill, were the first of the classic group to join, starting in 1970, leading to the inclusion of frontman Rob Halford, in 1973, and Tipton the next year. Downing says it’s he who both focused the band’s metal mission and honed their leathery image – key factors he feels have never been made plain to the public. “What people don’t know, they can’t give credit for,” he said.Yet, it was the band’s first record company, the small Gull label, which suggested the band augment their early guitar-bass-drums-singer lineup with another player. “So many bands had the same lineup,” he said. “They wanted us to stand out. So, they were asking: ‘Can you have a sax player or a keyboardist?’ We said, ‘That’s not going to happen.’ But having another lead guitar player was potentially a unique thing.”While there had been precursors to the double-lead approach, like the Allman Brothers, Wishbone Ash and Derek and the Dominos, it was Priest’s idea to lend the dynamic a new heaviness and, in key moments, to let the guitars mirror each other, creating rich harmonies. “We brought that sound to fruition, which I’m quite proud of,” the guitarist said. “Now many bands do it.”From the start, Downing and Tipton had different solo styles. “He was more blues orientated and slightly more commercial,” the guitarist said. “Mine was heavier, more nasty and abrasive.”As time went on, Downing said Tipton began to take more solo parts, and play with more flash, leading fans to think he was the primary lead. Downing didn’t speak up about it, a reticence, he believes, stems from a childhood spent suppressing his feelings of frustration with his parents. “I didn’t complain much,” he said. “But we would go through periods where you felt it’s best not to say things. It’s a bomb ready to go off.”Downing felt marginalized after Tipton formed a tight relationship with their manager, Jayne Andrews. Over the years, he felt increasingly cut out of key decisions about the band’s future, some of which he felt held them back. For example, management decided not to lend a song to the Top Gun soundtrack, which went on to sell millions. Downing believes that, plus certain other decisions, account for why Priest never sold more than 2m copies of one of their albums while other metal acts that peaked in the 80s, like Def Leppard, ACDC and Van Halen, sold up to five times as much.His book also deals with forces that threatened the band’s stability which fell beyond their control – like the infamous 1990 trial in which the parents of a fan who had killed himself tried to blame it on subliminal messages embedded in the group’s records. “It wasn’t just an attack on the band and a genre, but an attack on freedom,” Downing said.The guitarist also wrote about the pressure Halford felt as a gay man in the macho world of metal. Downing says Halford, who didn’t come out until he had left the band for a spell in 1998, was always out to the other members, from whom he received total support. Downing admits he’s not sure how fans might have felt about Halford’s orientation back in a far less accepting era. “Would that have been relevant in New York or LA?” he said. “Absolutely not. But in Texas? Maybe.”For Downing, the greater controversy had to do with his feeling that he had become, essentially, an employee in a band he helped mold. While in the book, Downing writes about sending the band a resignation letter, in our talk he revealed that he actually sent two. The first was a graceful exit note, implying a smooth retirement from music. The second was angrier, laying out all of his frustrations with specific parties. Downing believes that’s a key reason he wasn’t asked to return to the band after Tipton announced in February that he was stepping back due to his diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. In his stead, the band brought in another guitarist whom Downing calls a “clone” of himself. To make matters more painful, Downing’s oldest friend in the band, bassist Hill, said on the internet that their fans weren’t missing the departed guitarist. “I’m thinking, ‘Jesus Christ, Ian, I’m reading a different internet than you’,” Downing said. “It was a low blow coming from him.”The guitarist said the other members have also tried to oust him from his ongoing position as a co-director of the Priest organization, a role he’s loth to relinquish. With talk now percolating that the band could be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Downing has lately been asking himself “could that be done without me? Don’t know,” he said. “Could the 50th anniversary be done without me? Don’t know.”Whatever happens, Downing says he hopes he and the other members come to an understanding before it’s too late. “If something happened to me, I’d like to think the guys would come to my funeral, and vice versa,” he said. “You never know what’s going to happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4e4f094b8c35d478744f5b533c416c4d4d3e1a1/507_69_2637_1582/master/2637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7f0a4571bf742e7cc02185fe24a1ea6","title":"paul young how we made wherever i lay my hat thats my home","story":"How did an obscure Marvin Gaye B-side end up one of the biggest hits of the 80s? With a little help from Stravinsky – and an out of tune bassChrysalis Records saw my group, Q-Tips, as a party band. They weren’t doing much for our careers. Then, when the label dropped us, our manager said: “There’s not a lot of interest in the band, but there’s a lot of interest in you.” I thought I could make a solo album, then go back to the band. But No Parlez was the end of me and Q-Tips.As we were making the album, publishing companies were sending us all these overly complex songs. I said: “I just want a simple three-chord trick with a melody.” Then I remembered an old Marvin Gaye B-side I used to play at my friend’s house when I was 14. I went down to Rock On Records in Camden and said: “I’m after this old song.”Because that version of Wherever I Lay My Hat (That’s My Home) hadn’t been a hit, I effectively had a blank canvas. When we slowed it down, I saw there was more to the song. Marvin was singing from the perspective of a singer on the road, a love ’em and leave ’em, Jack-the-lad type. But, while this started off as fun, he realised there was an emptiness to what the character was doing. I tapped into that and put more melancholy into the vocal.We had the makings of an arrangement, but it only really took shape when keyboard player Ian “The Rev” Kewley said: “We should get that bass player from Jools Holland’s band” So Pino Palladino came down and played what is now one of the most famous basslines ever. It wasn’t quite right, though. What we had at that point was more Phil Spector-ish and swingy – but rather than change the bass, we changed the whole arrangement instead.The record company had a big argument over whether it was a single. “Nobody will know where the chorus starts,” they said. So Rev came up with a keyboard motif for just before I sing “Wherever I lay my hat”. That made the record company happy – and the single went to No 1.Suddenly, whenever I went on TV or did anything, everyone was interested in me, from the makeup girls to the studio crew. I’d never experienced anything like it. The Rev had struggled for years to make it as a musician, too. I remember us both outside the offices of our new label, CBS, having just been told we were about to have a No 1. “I’ve got to sit down,” said The Rev. “Everything I’ve always wanted to happen is about to happen, isn’t it?” We were both in shock.I’d been playing in bands in Cardiff. A friend started playing sax with Jools Holland and suggested I audition. “I’ll pay you £50 a week,” Jools said, “and you can sleep on my couch.” We toured as Jools Holland and the Millionaires, which was an inappropriate name as we never made any money. But we supported Q-Tips on tour and, after playing some fretless bass for Gary Numan, I got the call from Paul.The producer, Laurie Latham, just said: “Play something on the intro.” And that bass melody just came out. Afterwards, I realised I’d played something very similar to the opening of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring. I’d never listened to classical music – just whatever was on the radio – but it must have lodged in my brain from somewhere.After the record became a hit, David Gilmour from Pink Floyd called. Suddenly I was being asked to play with some of the biggest names in music. I’ve never stopped since.

It said the model would be similar to that used in Canada, which had “an open, welcoming approach to migration but no free movement agreement with any other country”.The committee was set up by Amber Rudd when she was home secretary to inform the UK’s migration policy after Brexit. It is designed to inform a white paper that has repeatedly been delayed but is due this autumn.EU citizens have, until now, been able to enter the UK freely, seeking work on arrival, and concerns about the impact of free movement is considered to be one of the central reasons why the country voted for Brexit. But the report is likely to strengthen the hand of those who want the UK to take a tough stance in the Brexit negotiations.The MAC report says there has a been small impact on wages and employment in the UK, arguing it has had “neither the large negative effects claimed by some, nor the benefits claimed by others”.But it also argues that because “the biggest gainers from migration are often the migrants themselves”, British ministers should see preferential access to the UK labour market as “something of value to offer in the negotiations” with the EU over the UK’s exit.Any future policy determined by the UK should favour higher-skilled workers over lower-skilled ones, the MAC advises, and says there should be no sector specific migration schemes except possibly for one to supply seasonal labour in agriculture.Jonathan Portes, senior fellow at the thinktank The UK in a Changing Europe, whose research fed into the report, said: “Contrary to fears that immigration might reduce the incentive for businesses to boost productivity, my paper suggests the opposite: immigration has a substantial and positive impact on productivity. Areas that see inflows of immigrants see productivity rise.“What does that mean for policy? The MAC are too polite to say so, but this report shows beyond doubt that the government’s economically illiterate net migration target should finally be put out of its misery. After Brexit, we will need immigration – for growth, productivity, and not least to help the public finances – more than ever.”Prof Alan Manning, who wrote the conclusion to the report, said the problem with free movement from the European Union was that “it leaves migration to the UK solely up to migrants and UK residents have no control over the level and mix of migration”. But he also concludes that free movement is not guaranteed to cause problems because “that likely depends on the level and mix of the migration flows that result”.The MAC report says that the existing tier 2 skilled workers scheme, which currently applies to people outside the EEA for skilled jobs earnings more than £30,000 a year, provides a useful template for a future migration scheme. Existing monthly caps should be abolished and Manning said it should be extended to “workers in medium-skilled jobs”.Manning said there should be no scheme for lower-skilled workers, aside, possibly, from in agriculture, although Manning recognised that some employers in some industrial sectors “will lobby intensively against this proposal”. He concluded that there would be enough low-skilled workers in the UK because “most of the existing stock will remain and there would likely be a continued flow through family migration or the existing youth mobility scheme”.The academic also indicated that he believed that the government’s annual net migration target of 100,000 was not helpful, arguing it would be better to raise the salary threshold for skilled worker visas to reduce inflows to the UK. The target has never been met since it was introduced by David Cameron in 2010. Manning said: “If you want influence migration flows it is much better to influence salary thresholds rather than use hard caps.”Net migration to the UK in the year to the end of March 2018 was 270,000, an increase of 28,000 year on year. But net migration from the EU sank to 87,000 in the same period, the lowest level since the Brexit vote in June 2016, according to the most recent set of figures from the Office of National Statistics.Business leaders and analysts expressed immediate concern over the recommendation that highly skilled workers should be favoured over low-skilled workers in future migration policy. They fear a £30,000 salary threshold and skilled worker visa system would make it almost impossible to recruit workers in warehouses, meat packing and fish factories, cleaning services, care and hospitality.“The MAC has missed the mark by failing to recognise the critical role of lower skilled workers to our economy,” said Jasmine Whitbread, the chief executive of London First, a business campaign group representing 200 big businesses in the capital.“Businesses want access to high and medium level skills from around the globe, as the MAC rightly recognises, but this can’t be at the expense of having enough workers to keep our hospitals, care homes, hotels and building sites up and running,” she added.Stephen Clarke, a senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “ If enacted these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid- and high-skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. This would represent a huge shift for low-paying sectors like food manufacturing, hotels and domestic personnel, where over one in five workers are migrants.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca27e76e9bcddbeead5e0ae0596e960e573258d/0_232_9000_5400/master/9000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31368449b977b538b2d566104f54275b","title":"it is the eus turn to compromise on brexit says dominic raab no deal","story":"Brexit secretary says UK has been more flexible, but Tusk says no deal still possibleDominic Raab has walked into a row over his demand that the EU compromises in the Brexit talks, as the European council president, Donald Tusk, warned that the “catastrophe” of a no-deal scenario was “still quite possible”.In an interview with continental European newspapers, the UK’s Brexit secretary had said it was the EU’s time to move on its red lines, and that warm words would not suffice with so little time left until Brexit day.“We have shown a lot of flexibility and we have been very pragmatic,” Raab said. “So I think this is the moment to see that matched … The ball is a little bit in the other court now.”The comments received a swift put-down from Austria’s minister for European affairs, Gernot Blümel, who made it clear that such a move by the EU was not on the cards, despite the growing threat of a no-deal Brexit.Raab was speaking on the eve of a leaders’ summit in Salzburg where Theresa May will appeal to the 27 EU member states to soften their stance on the single market and customs union to get a deal done. The leaders will discuss the state of the negotiations over lunch the following day.“Salzburg is an informal EU summit, but it will be an important milestone – a stepping stone if you like – to show we’ve actually got the contours of an agreement on principles to continue the final weeks of these negotiations,” Raab said. “Positive words are helpful. But what we need now is concrete action and decisions.”Yet EU officials and ministers indicated that there was no prospect of compromise by the EU on its opposition to the central economic planks of May’s Chequers proposals: a common rulebook on goods and a customs arrangement to allow the UK frictionless trade and the power to strike its own free-trade deals.A senior EU official said the debate among the leaders in Salzburg would rather focus on whether it might be necessary for the political declaration to be vague in areas, and leave the arguments over the trading relationship until after Brexit, a so-called blind Brexit.“I know that there are indeed two approaches: have a joint political declaration that is very much clear to the last point or to have a political declaration which, while recognising already an agreement on a number of issues, leaves a certain space for negotiations on a number of issues,” the official said. “I think at this stage this will be at the core of the debate in Salzburg how detailed it will be.”Raab said in his interview that a vague declaration would not, however, work for the UK. He said: “In the political statement, we must determine the direction in which we will move in the future. Otherwise it will be difficult to get the necessary support from our parliament and the citizens.”France is among the member states who want the terms of the future trading relationship clear to avoid ambiguity and prolonged internal and external negotiations after 29 March 2019.In a letter to the leaders before the meeting, published on Tuesday, Tusk nevertheless said everything must be done to avoid a no-deal Brexit, in a sign that he is open to such a “blind Brexit”. He also proposed that an extraordinary Brexit summit be approved in Salzburg, as first reported by the .“With only six months to go before the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, we are entering the final weeks of negotiations,” Tusk wrote.“Therefore, I want us to review progress in these talks and to discuss the way forward with three objectives in mind. First, we should reach a common view on the nature and overall shape of the joint political declaration about our future partnership with the UK.“Second, we will discuss how to organise the final phase of the Brexit talks, including the possibility of calling another European council in November. Third, we should reconfirm the need for a legally operational backstop on Ireland, so as to be sure that there will be no hard border in the future.“Let me recall that limiting the damage caused by Brexit is our shared interest,” Tusk aded. “Unfortunately, a no-deal scenario is still quite possible. But if we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe.”An EU official said the bloc needed to have “something on paper” on its position with regard to the political declaration by October’s European council, should there be any hope of finding agreement within the time left before Brexit.Beyond the differences over the Chequers proposals, there is still an impasse over the issue of the backstop solution that would ensure that there would never be a hard border on the island of Ireland.Raab insisted in his interviews with papers including Spiegel and Le Monde that the EU’s proposal to in effect keep Northern Ireland in the single market and customs union remained unacceptable.“Under no circumstances will we allow a customs border to be pulled through the Irish Sea,” he said. “The territorial and economic integrity of Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK must be respected.”He further repeated his warning that the UK would not pay its full £39bn orce bill in the event of no deal. “The agreement we made politically under the exit agreement would not be the sum we would pay in this case,” he said. “The pressure in this country would be too big to do that.”This will mean that inspection on agri-goods destined for Northern Ireland from Britain will be checked in Dublin port first, helping Michel Barnier’s efforts to “de-dramatise” the Irish border issue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f76082452c46dd305142c0c2d3a81c1faf9796f6/0_207_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=605b08dc6c9830e6d3a4e3a1684fbe7e","title":"vince cable liberal democrats party conference brexit","story":"Leader says party can still be radical on issues such as Brexit as he prepares to deliver conference speechVince Cable has defended his decision to label his party a “movement for moderates” but said the Liberal Democrats could still be radical on issues such as Brexit and civil liberties.On the morning of his keynote speech to party conference, Cable saids it was an “important factor in our appeal” that the Lib Dems could claim a wide space in the centre of politics. Voters wanted “reassurance the country is not heading to the extremes of left or right”, he said.“But we are also not halfway between the two parties on many issues. On Brexit, on environmental issues, social justice, on civil liberties, we have a radical and distinct position.”Cable, who has announced he wants to hand over the reins of his party to the next generation, said May also needed to look at her leadership on Brexit and consider another referendum on the issue.“Even now, Theresa May could shock us all by displaying true leadership,” he said. “She could admit that the Brexit project has gone badly wrong by conceding that the deal – any deal, or no deal – that she will bring back from Brussels is not going to be better for Britain than remaining in the European Union.“Instead of kowtowing to her enemies in the Conservative arty, she could lead her party and the country by opening her mind to a people’s vote on the final deal.”In his speech to party members on Tuesday, Cable will say that Brexit “fundamentalists” are prepared to risk the economic future of the poorest people in the UK in return for the “erotic spasm” of leaving the EU.Cable will refer to “the latest piece of nastiness from Jacob Rees-Mogg: calling into question the right of Europeans to stay in Britain and of Britons to stay in Europe, creating unnecessary worry and insecurity for millions.”Cable will say European leaders have been “moved to pity” by May’s predicament. “She is dutifully delivering a policy she doesn’t really believe in … When we feel sorry for the country’s prime minister, something is seriously wrong.

Here are some highlights she’s picked out.And here is some reaction to the MAC report from thinktanks and academics.From Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, a thinktank specialising in the needs of low and middle-earnersThe migration advisory committee’s recommendations would, if accepted by government, represent the biggest change to the UK labour market in a generation.If enacted these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid- and high- skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. This would represent a huge shift for low-paying sectors like food manufacturing, hotels and domestic personnel, where over one in five workers are migrants.While it will take some time for the government to respond to this report, it is time those sectors started to prepare more proactively for change, including by looking at the need to invest in new technology, and recruiting from harder to reach parts of the existing UK population.From Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a thinktank focusing on integration, migration and ersity.The MAC is right to recommend that high-skilled and low-skilled migration are treated differently in future. Most of the public would agree. That should also mean the end of the one-size-fits-all net migration target.The report also rightly notes that funding to manage the local impacts of immigration on public services needs to get to the areas that need it most. Expanding the Controlling Immigration Fund would be one way to do this. In our research across the UK we found that local impacts make a real difference to how people view immigration.This report should now prompt politicians to step up and lead the debate about how Britain will approach immigration after Brexit – a debate that’s been ducked and delayed for the last two years, causing frustration and mistrust on all sides.It is missing a vital element, however – the voice of the public. Neither the MAC nor the government has engaged the public in the choices we now face on immigration. That’s a serious oversight - the national conversation on immigration found an urgent need to rebuild public confidence and consent in our immigration system, and greater public engagement would help to do that.From Ryan Shorthouse, director of Bright Blue, a liberal Conservative thinktank The migration advisory committee has provided evidence that cuts through the exaggerations of both sides of a very isive debate, showing that immigration generally has no or very modest positive economic and social impacts. The migration advisory committee has offered some strong suggestions for reforming our immigration system: abolishing the cap on tier 2 (general) visas and extending the tier 5 youth mobility scheme, as Bright Blue has been campaigning for.But this report was a missed opportunity to propose significant reforms to our post-Brexit immigration system to ensure it is more effective, popular and contributory-based.From Prof Jonathan Portes, a senior fellow at The UK in a Changing Europe, an academic network, who wrote a paper that contributed to the MAC reportWhat does that mean for policy? The MAC are too polite to say so, but this report shows beyond doubt that the government’s economically illiterate net migration target should finally be put out of its misery. After Brexit, we will need immigration – for growth, productivity, and not least to help the public finances – more than ever. Since 2010, many aspects of UK immigration policy have been based not on analysis and evidence but on unpleasant and damaging nativism. This report provides an opportunity for our politicians to reverse that, if they have the courage to take it.From Richard Brown, research director at the Centre for London, a thinktank focusing on the needs of LondonThis report highlights the positive contribution that highly skilled EU workers bring to London’s economy. Yes we need bankers, lawyers, tech specialists, but we also need low skilled workers too.Nearly 30 per cent of London’s construction workers are from the EU. A huge number of European workers keep the city’s cafes, restaurants and hotels running. London’s design, artistic and tech start-ups benefit from London’s ability to draw workers from across the continent.Expanding the youth mobility scheme to EU workers would enable young Europeans to fill some of the gaps, and changes to the tier 2 visa system are steps in the right direction - though the process will still be daunting for many small businesses. But we need a flexible system - one which maintains the frictionless movement of people - to help London meet its needs.And here is a response to the MAC report from the CBI’s UK policy director, Matthew Fell. Like other business groups (see 12.42pm), the CBI is worried that the recommendations could increase labour shortages.This report provides useful insights but is not a roadmap for a new system.The findings are clear about the immigration idend. Productivity and innovation benefit from migration, and training for UK workers increases. It finds barely any negative effects for jobs or wages for UK citizens ...The current non-EU visa system is highly bureaucratic and cannot be extended to EU workers without major reform, so the MAC is right to recommend scrapping the tier 2 cap. But these proposals don’t go far enough.But retaining the £30,000 salary threshold would block many essential workers from coming to the UK. Similarly, plans outlined for low-skilled workers are inadequate, and risks damaging labour shortages.The government should now build on this evidence to pursue an open and controlled system that shows the UK remains open to the world, and make Global Britain a reality.Lord Green, chair of Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for controls on immigration, is not impressed by the MAC report, the BBC reports.The Irish government is expected to approve plans to hire 450 new customs and inspection officers for Dublin Port before the end of the year as preparations for Brexit are ramped up.This will mean that inspection on agri-goods destined for Northern Ireland from Britain will be checked in Dublin Port first, helping Michel Barnier’s efforts to “de-dramatise” the Irish border issue.Here is some business reaction to the MAC report.From Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of DirectorsToday’s report rightly punctures some of the more negative stories around the impact of overseas workers in the UK. The conclusion in particular that migration does not impact the training of the UK-born workforce bears out the evidence from business leaders. For employers, this isn’t an either-or choice, nine out of ten of our members who employ from abroad also invest in training domestically.Firms will cheer the proposal to remove the cap on skilled tier 2 visas, and to look in detail at ways of lowering bureaucratic burden. However, given the report’s focus on the benefits of skilled migration, the MAC’s backing of the ‘skills charge’ as a means of lowering the influx of skilled migrants seems contradictory.From Jane Gratton, head of business environment and skills at the British Chambers of CommerceFrom the perspective of businesses facing severe skills gaps, the MAC’s report gives with one hand and takes away with the other, and the recommendations are unlikely to meet the needs of all employers. Any sudden cut-off of EEA skills and labour would be concerning, if not disastrous, for firms across a wide range of regions and sectors.We support the recommendation to scrap the tier 2 cap on skilled workers, having long called on the government to drop this non-sensical restriction on accessing the best talent from around the world. But businesses don’t just need the ‘best and brightest’ – industries such as agriculture, hospitality and social care rely on overseas labour to fill local shortages.Businesses will be frustrated by the committee’s recommendation to extend the immigration skills charge to EEA workers, further increasing costs at a time when three-quarters of firms are reporting skills shortages. Businesses are already questioning where this money goes and how funds are used to support vocational education here at home.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is in Japan for talks with his opposite number. He said he was “cautiously optimistic” that the UK and the EU would reach a deal on Brexit. He said:I don’t think it’s brinkmanship. If we can’t come to an agreement, then the default is that we will leave the EU on the 29th of March. So that could happen. But I don’t think it’s in anyone’s interest for that to happen. So that’s why we are cautiously optimistic that we will get a deal but there is a lot of work to do to get there.He also urged people not to write off Theresa May, saying:Polling conducted in constituencies and on eurosceptic issues of “potential strategic significance” to Ukip did not breach UK donation rules, an investigation has found. As the Press Association reports, the Electoral Commission said the research could have benefited the party but it did not conclude it was done to help Ukip or that they received any of the results. The watchdog therefore ruled the polling was not a donation to Ukip under UK political finance rules, adding it would re-examine the issue should new evidence come to light. The commission’s work focused on whether Ukip took “impermissible donations” from the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe (ADDE), a grouping which had MEPs from several countries but with a large Ukip majority, and the Institute for Direct Democracy in Europe (IDDE). The investigation emerged after a 2016 European parliament audit found ADDE and IDDE misused more than €500,000 euros of EU funding, including on polling of interest to Ukip linked to the 2015 general election and ahead of the EU referendum, the Press Association reports.Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, says the government should not respond to the migration advisory committee report by reducing immigration after Brexit at the expense of growth.UPDATE: And here is Khan’s statement on the report in full.This report is a missed opportunity to protect jobs and economic growth that are at grave risk from Theresa May’s appallingly mishandled approach to Brexit, and from a government that is only motivated by its ideological and economically illiterate migration target – regardless of the cost to real peopleLondon’s entrepreneurialism and economic growth is partly down to the flow of ideas and people from Europe and around the world. British businesses will pay a heavy price if the government fails to protect their access to a European workforce at all skill levels in the future. Of course more must be done to give local workforces the skills needed for the jobs of the future – but responsibility for this lies squarely with this government, who have consistently failed to invest enough in education, skills and training.Any decision by this government to prioritise reducing immigration at the expense of economic growth will damage our country for years to come.A no-deal Brexit will make it harder for police to protect UK citizens as forces fall back on “slower, more bureaucratic” systems, one of the country’s most senior officers has warned. As the Press Association reports, Sara Thornton, chairman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, spoke as plans were unveiled for a new unit that will oversee how forces use alternative systems if the UK crashes out if the EU in the spring. She said:The fallbacks we’re going to have to use will be slower, will be more bureaucratic and it will make it harder for us to protect UK citizens and make it harder to protect EU citizens.There are 40 tools that UK law enforcement may lose access to, including the European Arrest Warrant and the Schengen Information System, which was accessed 539m times by British authorities last year alone, the Press Association reports.As Alan Travis, the ’s former home affairs editor points out, the Home Office says it will “carefully consider” the migration advisory committee recommendations before giving a substantive response.Last week the Times’ Sam Coates reported that Theresa May was planning to use the Conservative party conference to announce strict immigrations controls after Brexit. In his story (paywall) Coates said:Theresa May wants to announce strict immigration controls at the Tory party conference to reassure Brexiteers and steady her leadership in the face of open revolt.Downing Street has summoned the cabinet to a special meeting on September 24, less than a week before the party gathers in Birmingham. Immigration is expected to feature during that meeting and cabinet ministers have been promised a discussion on immigration before the conference, sources told The Times ...The migration scheme after Britain leaves is likely to end preferential access for EU citizens and could subject non-EU citizens to equal restrictions. It could involve visas for EU citizens who want to live in Britain.There is a cap on the numbers of skilled and unskilled workers who can come from outside the EU at present, while anyone can come from within the EU. Under a global system the same cap would apply to all non-UK citizens wanting to come and live in Britain.Mrs May and Mr Javid are united in a desire for a global migration scheme despite doubts among some cabinet colleagues, including Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Greg Clark, the business secretary.It is easy to see why an announcement along these lines appeals to Number 10. There is a lot of evidence to suggest Conservative activists are deeply unhappy about May’s Chequers Brexit plan. But on immigration May’s personal instincts are hardline (David Cameron used to joke that she was the only person in his cabinet who actually agreed with his target for reducing net migration) and she’s more likely to get a cheer at conference announcing this than from almost anything else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9865b4640914d60b8bc779641f896366f632b333/0_23_3390_2035/master/3390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=487cf0eba4b6d85427d37509e9796807","title":"what does your regional accent mean to you","story":"We would like to hear your thoughts and experiences for an upcoming article discussing the themeAccents can shape our identity.

England’s World Cup preparations begin in early May with a limited overs series at home to Pakistan but the club have already signed another leg-spinner in Josh Poysden from Warwickshire.The news comes after Rashid declined a recent approach from Worcestershire, with the newly crowned T20 Blast champions on Saturday having hoped to unite Rashid with his close friend and England team-mate, Moeen Ali, at New Road. Durham’s chairman, Sir Ian Botham, had also made public his interest in a deal.But the previous problems between Rashid and Yorkshire – including issues with the head coach, Andrew Gale, that date back to the latter’s time as captain – look to have been smoothed over, while he is also said to be reluctant to leave his home town of Bradford.Yorkshire’s disgruntlement at the time of Rashid’s Test return revolved chiefly around the communication leading up to the decision by Ed Smith, the national selector, to name a player who had previously appeared intent on pursing a limited overs career.Rashid went on to play a reduced role in the seam-dominated 4-1 victory over India, claiming 10 wickets at 30 apiece, but lit up the final day at the Oval with an astonishing leg-break out of the footmarks to bowl centurion KL Rahul. He will doubtless play a more significant hand during the upcoming Test series in Sri Lanka this winter.As a key member of England’s white-ball side – only Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan can match his 110 ODI wickets since the last World Cup – Rashid will also be among the names when Eoin Morgan’s squad for the upcoming limited overs leg of the tour is published on Wednesday.Sam Curran, who made his ODI debut at the end of the 5-0 whitewash over Australia, is also expected to be among the touring party after the left-arm all-rounder’s player of the series performance during the recent Test victory India.The first of five one-dayers is in Dambulla on 10 October, before a single Twenty20 and the three-match Test series that begins in Galle on 6 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed6f49a53e15aaaa27628d1652522becb3a55007/200_482_4157_2495/master/4157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83590cc8a01773fb5576327d0273f7c","title":"england pro contracts change womens rugby union for ever","story":"There is nothing new about professionalism in women’s rugby. Since the Netherlands became the first country to award contracts to their women’s sevens players in 2011, the rest of the women’s rugby world has been playing catch-up – off the pitch at least – in the game’s rapid acceleration towards the pro ranks.Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, Canada, the US, Russia and Spain quickly followed the Dutch lead and England eventually offered full-time contracts in 2014.So to the casual observer of Monday’s announcement that England are to offer full-time permanent deals to the nation’s top 15s players, perhaps it felt like old news. But that would be to underestimate a groundbreaking decision that is set to change the women’s game for ever. For while there is indeed nothing new about professionalism within women’s rugby, a full-time sevens game is a vastly different beast from a pro 15s game.Primarily this is because sevens funding does not just trickle down from a country’s own national union. Income for top sevens players, who are competing on the World Series and at the Olympics, is usually a mix and match affair with investment also flowing from the many other bodies which offer investment for Olympic sports. In Canada, for example, a significant chunk of its women’s programme is funded by Own the Podium, a not-for-profit organisation which funds an array of Olympic sports.While that funding is hardly excessive, it has meant the shift from amateur to professional in women’s sevens has been relatively pain-free thanks to a stable funding base, while at the same time allowing less-established rugby nations like Spain, Canada, Russia and – for a short period – the Netherlands, to keep up and thrive.The same will not be true in a professional women’s 15s world where primary sources of funding will remain union-driven. England’s deals will include a flat player contract fee plus match fees, on top of which leading players will be free to secure their own sponsorship and commercial deals.They will become the first permanent full-time Test team, having had contracts trialled for a year in the lead up to the 2017 World Cup, and will have rival nations like France and New Zealand, who currently offer part-time deals to top 15s players, watching on with envy.It was interesting if not naive to see players from other nations herald England’s decision and raise demands for their own unions to follow suit and create a “level playing field”. The stark truth is that there will be no level playing field and, just like the men’s game, the countries offering the most financial clout to their teams will streak ahead.But it will not all be about cash – it will also be about will. Countries like Ireland, Australia and Wales have yet to show significant willing when it comes to matching their potential with the funding that would help to realise it. Countries with less cash, like 2017 World Cup semi-finalists USA and former Six Nations competitors Spain, will find themselves expected to compete with full-time players and falling behind.It would be tempting to draw parallels with where the men’s game was when it turned professional in the 1990s but this time players are contracted to their union, a decision which will bring its own challenges while offering stability.As with all great steps forward in sport, England’s decision has in part been driven by pressure and by lessons learned in failure. The Rugby Football Union faced a PR storm at last year’s World Cup following the news that the players who had taken them all the way to the final would be out of contract and therefore out of a job just hours after the final whistle.The RFU’s announcement on Monday was a vindication of sorts for those, including leading English players, who hammered the union for their poor handling and short-termism.While it is understandable that the RFU’s decision has been reported in some quarters as a U-turn, the truth is it is so much more than that: women’s 15s is going pro and the game is set to change for ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0809b48d3944df15b9c87f4e983ae96e1b564f38/315_0_4373_2626/master/4373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8957eed40d2d31aa03b642474c8c89e2","title":"talking horses where was the security on st leger day at doncaster","story":"Video of prolonged tomfoolery on Saturday suggests security presence was inadequate for a busy and prestigious racedayTwitter users who take an interest in racing will probably, by now, have seen a video of some bad behaviour by a particular racegoer at Doncaster on St Leger day. Apparently efforts are being made to identify her but that’s not what concerns me (which is why I’m not linking to the video). What concerns me is how she was allowed to behave in that way without being stopped by security.The video shows a young woman climbing over the paddock rail and falling over onto the other side, where she lies seemingly helpless while her friends behind the camera laugh at her. The video then cuts to her doing the same thing again, presumably moments later. Then suddenly she’s got an outsize umbrella, like the ones used by on-course bookmakers, and is opening it up inside the grandstand and marching about with it.Then she’s doing the same thing outside in the betting ring. Finally she’s shown using the umbrella to make a mock charge at a poor guy trying to make sandwiches in a branch of Subway, having apparently left the racecourse by this time. Bookmakers on Twitter claim the umbrella had been taken from one of their number during the afternoon and that it will cost £300 to replace.We’ve all seen much worse behaviour at the races but it’s stunning that no security intervened at any point, given how obvious all this must have been. The umbrella is about as big as the woman wielding it and she seems to have been making plenty of noise while toting it all around the racecourse and then out onto the street. Where was the security on this important, prestigious Classic raceday?A spokesman for Doncaster racecourse tells me: “It is disappointing to see an inidual behaving this way. However, we were delighted at the positive atmosphere across the racecourse on Saturday. We are looking into this incident and will contact the bookmaker directly with regards to any loss they may have suffered.”My concern is that racecourses generally, having been induced to ramp up security in the spring in response to fights at Goodwood and Ascot that made lots of headlines, have since cut back once more. The evidence of Saturday is that, on that day at Doncaster at least, security was inadequate and perhaps we should count ourselves lucky that the only consequence was somebody pratting about with an umbrella.Today’s nap is Wufud (7.00), largely because I thought he’d be a bigger price than he should be, but he’s proved so unpopular in the betting that it worries me a bit. He opened at 4s last night but is now a general 10-1 shot.Anyway, he’s bred to improve with time and distance, so I think there’s every reason to hope for another step forward on his Ffos Las win. Charlie Hills’s yard is in form, which is not true of many of the large operators at this late stage of the season, and Wufud went well around this track on his debut in April. I’ll reduce my stake in view of the drift and hope that the market’s love for the Sir Michael Stoute favourite is the only reason for it.There is also 10-1 available, more predictably, about a Hills runner in the previous race. Delicious (6.30) showed a bit of ability through the greenness on her debut last month but two modest subsequent efforts have put her on a very interesting rating for her handicap debut today. This is a very open race but I can easily see her running above her odds.There’s a couple of interesting shorties at Yarmouth, if you like that sort of thing. Magic J (2.20) has a big home reputation, which is clearly why his odds have dropped from 7-1 to 13-8 of course we’re all aware that those reputations don’t always translate to the track. Long Call (3.20) is a 6-4 shot running off the same mark as when he won an apprentice race last week and he has Oisin Murphy aboard this time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cebd286b9ef50e8647c874c093aad8373a74aae/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab3c66eaf7281f5759c7cacd4e91fee5","title":"british diver vernon unsworth sues elon musk over pedo claim","story":"Vernon Unsworth files lawsuit in LA seeking damages after row over Thai cave rescueA British er who helped rescue young football players trapped in a Thai cave is suing the Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, for defamation.Vernon Unsworth alleges that Musk falsely accused him on Twitter of being a paedophile. A lawsuit filed in Los Angeles federal court seeks at least $75,000 (£57,000) in damages and a court order preventing Musk from making further allegations, while Unsworth is also bringing action in the English and Welsh courts.Musk called Unsworth, who was instrumental in the successful rescue operation, a “pedo” after the er criticised him in a television interview. Musk and SpaceX engineers built a small submarine and shipped it to Thailand to help with the cave rescue. The device was not used and Unsworth called it a PR stunt.The er alleges in his complaint that Musk later accused him of moving to Thailand to be with a bride who was about 12 years old. Unsworth says Musk “embarked on a PR campaign to destroy” his reputation after becoming angry at an interview he gave to the US television network, CNN.Unsworth had told the broadcaster that Musk’s device “had absolutely no chance of working”, that Musk “had no conception of what the cave passage was like” and that Musk could “stick his submarine where it hurts”.The er accuses Musk of “publishing false and heinous accusations of criminality against him to the public”. In the court filing, seen by the , he adds that Musk posted a series of tweets directed at Unsworth on 15 July, calling his claims about the submarine into question and adding: “Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.”The complaint notes that Musk deleted the tweets and posted two more that “purported to be an apology” three days later.Lawyers for Unsworth wrote to Musk threatening to sue on 6 August, though Musk publicly claimed about two weeks later that no such action had been taken. “You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? “ he tweeted in response to another user.The complaint says: “Musk’s 28 August tweet conveyed to the average reader that Mr Unsworth’s failure to sue him was evidence that Mr Unsworth is, in fact, a pedophile and guilty of the most heinous crimes.” That accusation was followed by a host of further similar allegations in an email from Musk to a reporter at Buzzfeed, which Unsworth’s lawyers argue are also untrue.“Instead of retracting his false accusations and ceasing his campaign to impugn Mr Unsworth, Musk publicly stated, ‘I fucking hope he sues me,’” the US complaint says.On Monday, Unsworth’s lawyer in the US, Lin Wood said: “Musk’s influence and wealth cannot … protect him from accountability for his wrongdoing in a court of law.”“Elon Musk is being brought to account for repeatedly attacking and taunting the good name of an ordinary spelunker, Vernon Unsworth, who answered the call and, with others, put his life on the line to help rescue the 13 trapped in the caves in Thailand. I still carry the light of hope that Mr Musk will withdraw his baseless allegations and properly vindicate Mr Unsworth.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9acb76ab99524edd5e56a3696c4ff9596f837e1f/112_434_4796_2878/master/4796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3673ff27cd30afd3f9c3dad4886675d2","title":"iphone xs max review roundup iphone xr","story":"Early consensus from tech press is these are best iPhones to date. Is it worth holding on for the cheaper iPhone XR?The first wave of verdicts from select reviewers given early access to Apple’s latest iPhone XS and XS Max are live.Gone are the traditional iPhones of yesteryear, with three devices launched all with a design in line with last year’s iPhone X. The iPhone XS is a direct replacement for the 2017 iPhone X, complete with a 5.8in screen costing £999. The iPhone XS Max is a larger, more expensive phone costing £1,099 and with a 6.5in screen, the largest on an iPhone.The iPhone XR is a slightly cheaper phone costing £749 with a 6.1in screen, but it won’t be released until October., not given early access to the new phones, will review them when they arrive in the post with normal punters’ pre-orders. But for now, this is what a privileged few thought of the to most expensive iPhones for 2018.It’s a pretty and premium design befitting of a phone which starts at £999, but also one which strikes me as being still worryingly susceptible to damage. The glass back is slippery when not covered in a case, though it doesn’t seem to collect as many fingerprints as the iPhone X, and it’s fairly heavy despite being thin. It also looks and feels expensive, which is just as well, because it is.But it is the camera improvements that are worth buying:The XS series is a significant improvement on the X – colour is richer and more evenly dispersed (this is thanks to the Quad-LED True Tone flash), with brights and neons really popping, and texture is captured in higher quality. These are best evidenced in portraits of people: skin and hair is closer to life than the photos taken in previous models.The better sensor and the new image processor on the A12 Bionic chip combine to enable what Apple calls “Smart HDR.” In practice, that means my photos look better in low light and extreme contrast situations, making for better pictures whether shot on a night-time street, in a dark bar or in bright sunlight.Bright lights in my living room show more detail now, and don’t turn into blown-up bright spots like they used to. I see more detail around windows and street lights. I’m also finding less blur and noise in most shots. Sometimes, it almost seems like too much light. The colour and brightness of some shots is surprising. I’m much happier with my photos now.FaceID on the XS is ever so slightly faster than the X — just an extra beat quicker. It’s noticeable side by side, but it’s not so much faster that you won’t find yourself pointedly staring at the phone to unlock it from time to time. iOS 12 lets you add a “secondary appearance,” which allows you to set up a second person if you want, which is nice.Other than the minor speed increase and secondary appearance support, FaceID is still FaceID: it doesn’t work in landscape or upside down or anything like that. If you wear glasses like me, you’ll still have to enter your passcode every morning when you wake up because you’re holding the phone too close to your face for it to work. And sunglasses that block IR light will still prevent it from working — Apple says it’s working with sunglass makers to ship new kinds of sunglasses that support FaceID. (Only Apple can get another entirely different industry to adapt to its phone, instead of the other way around.)The XS is basically a new model with some improvements. Most of those improvements, though, are kind of hard to notice.Take the screen, for example. It’s still a brilliant, colourful and sharp OLED display that supports next-gen HDR 4K video. It’s one of the best screens on the market, up there with the display on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. But some of the improvements, like its increased dynamic range, can only be spotted when viewing photos. And even then, I don’t think most folks will notice. This isn’t bad it just means the screen is still really good and we’re getting to a point where it’s hard to distinguish upgrades.Aside from one of the phones having a giant display, the iPhone XS and the larger iPhone XS Max don’t feel much different from last year’s iPhone X. This year’s phones don’t spark strong feelings – except maybe chagrin that they cost so much.It’s impressive incrementalism: There’s a noticeably faster chip, and a camera that captures a greater level of detail that you can actually see. Apple has nudged innovation in smartphones forward again, even if some of the results (like new apps that will use the new tech) have yet to be experienced.With subtle but strong improvements over last year’s X, (subtle, that’s what the S stands for, right?) the XS and XS Max are fabulous phones. But we’ve hit a point where every smartphone is great — it comes down to what you want and what you want to spend.Don’t blame me, blame Apple … and keep your wallet closed. See you in a month with the XR review.Stern also noted that you’ll probably need a case if you do buy one of these £1,000+ phones:Both the XS and XS Max have what Apple says is “the most durable glass in the world.” That said, my XS Max review unit cracked after a minor fall onto wood. All these glass slabs still need protection.The iPhone XS Max design is deceptive. Pick it up, and the rounded sides of the handset make it feel noticeably thick.The result is a phone that doesn’t sit as comfortably in the hand as it could, and considering the size and cost of the XS Max it’s a phone you want to be able to securely hold. This is only half the story though.We compared the iPhone XS Max to a number of phones during our in-depth review, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (6.4-inch screen), OnePlus 6 (6.2-inch) and Sony Xperia XZ3 (6-inch), and the iPhone felt thicker, and less planted in the hand then all of them.The funny thing is though, the iPhone XS Max is thinner than all of those phones at just 7.7mm.The reason for this is simple: tapered edges. The Samsung, Sony and OnePlus all taper their rear edges, giving the impression of a thinner device while also allowing them to sit a little better in the curvature of your hand.The iPhone XS Max has a totally flat back that’s a little more awkward to hold, and we found that a tactfully-placed pinkie finger on the underside of the phone was a must for one-handed use.There’s been a lot of discussion raging online over whether it’s too big, which I wholly disagree with.The iPhone XS Max demands two hands, and how much you enjoy this will hinge on how accustomed you are to using larger handsets. I’ve been a fan of larger phones for years, so not being able to text one-handed or having to stretch my hand up to reach and pull down the Control Centre is worth it in terms of the benefits presented by a larger screen: higher resolution, making watching TV, films and videos a better experience, and making it easier to play games, write documents and emails and edit photos.If you don’t like larger phones, the answer is simple: no one’s forcing you to buy one.So while the iPhone XS and XS Max appear to be the best smartphones Apple has made, and you won’t be disappointed if you’re an iPhone-only buyer and have already pre-ordered them, it might be worth waiting to see what the marginally cheaper iPhone XR is like before sinking £1,000 into a new iPhone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4379ef0e06dab98b416bee183fda0c8da0d57322/0_283_1632_978/master/1632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf71e2b2109f4de518b34eba01e3da06","title":"share your experiences monitoring screentime with ios 12","story":"We would like to hear how new “digital wellbeing” services are affecting how you use technologyDigital wellbeing tools built into the latest Apple mobile software aim to help people reduce the time they spend looking at screens.In common with some services on Google’s Android, the Screen Time app generates weekly reports showing app usage, notifications received and even how often you pick up your phone.

But that doesn’t prevent them being each other’s most avid supporter“Jo has this incredibly noble job,” says Susan Wokoma of her little sister, a nurse. “But she’ll say: ‘When we were growing up, we’d watch TV and now you’re in programmes I watch.’ That makes me feel proud of what I’ve done.”Since graduating from drama school in 2010, Susan has rarely been off our screens, notably with parts in supernatural teen drama Crazyhead and cult hit Chewing Gum. She’s also been successful on stage, making her West End debut in 2017 in James Graham’s Labour of Love. It means that although she and Jo still live close to one another in south London, where they grew up, they can sometimes go months without meeting up. “With my job, it’s really difficult,” she says. “I have to drop everything if I get a role and it can be all-consuming. But when we can, we’ll meet for a drink – it’s lovely.”As children, Susan and Jo weren’t nearly as close. Susan was the third child of four and Jo the youngest, so she got away with a lot, Susan says. “My older brother was the only boy, so he could do no wrong, whereas I consider myself the middle child.” Their mother, a cleaner who worked night shifts at MI5, dressed Susan and her elder sister identically, despite their six-year age gap. “When she started to get too old for it, I thought, ‘Cool’ – but then Jo turned up and I had to match with her. Mum dressed us like little Victorian children.”Three-and-a-half years younger, Jo looked up to Susan. “I wanted to follow her everywhere, but on the handful of times she’d take me to her friends’ houses, I’d do something to annoy her – like ask too many questions,” says Jo.“She spoke gobbledygook for a long time, and I couldn’t make out what she was saying – I found her quite sinister,” laughs Susan.For a period, their mother worked at Peckham fire station and would occasionally take the girls to work with her. One of Susan’s favourite memories, she recalls, is of the firefighters letting them play with the hoses, and drenching each other with water.At school, Susan was the good girl, “smart and very together”, recalls Jo, whereas Jo herself was “forever getting into trouble or getting suspended”. During their teenage years, they argued a lot – about makeup, magazines or clothes. Their paths erged even further after a teacher advised Susan to audition for the National Youth Theatre.“After that, I knew my route quite quickly, whereas Jo was quite a difficult kid and it took her a bit longer to find what she wanted to do,” says Susan.Their relationship changed in the coming years. “I’m not especially close to our older sister, so I thought: ‘Be the older sister you would want.’ I started asking Jo how she was, what was going on in her life. I wanted to be the first person she would come to if she was having trouble,” says Susan.Jo had decided to train as a nurse, but halfway through her course, she became pregnant. “I was only 20 and we all knew my dad was going to be really cross, because he wanted me to finish uni,” says Jo.Their Nigerian father worked full-time in the Home Office, as well as having a weekend security job at the Royal Festival Hall. “He had that immigrant mentality of work, work, work,” says Susan, and he wanted his children to do well.“I didn’t tell him until I was over five months pregnant,” says Jo, “and I asked Susan to come with me.”Their father died after Jo’s son was born, and it was Susan’s encouragement that drove Jo to finish her nursing degree. “He always said he wanted me to go back and finish, and I had no intention of doing it, but Susan had just finished filming The Inbetweeners 2 in Australia and she said: ‘If you complete it by the summer, you can come with me to the premiere.’ I graduated and she took me with her, which was really cool.”Now, they message via WhatsApp almost every day, even when Susan is filming, and meet up in person whenever they can. “As I’ve got older I’ve realised she’s super-quick and super-funny,” says Susan. “Actually, she’s overtaken me in some ways – she’s got all these responsibilities, while I’m floating around auditioning or trying to write stuff. I’ve got massive respect for her.”The feeling’s mutual. “Susan’s always been very real and matter-of-fact,” says Jo. “When I was younger I didn’t quite understand – I just thought she was horrible! Now I realise she’s straight with me and that’s what we all lack in our lives. A lot of people tell us what we want to hear, but Susan’s not like that. Any advice she gives is always spot-on, and always in my best interests. She’s a really special person.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f91bebf7b4013fafbabd01fbaaa20a3394aab122/0_121_1799_1079/master/1799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81cb6b8a168e6f3e64e4775c806950db","title":"chef tom oldroyd on his inspirational siblings and post polpo ventures","story":"Tom Oldroyd is one of London’s hottest chefs.

But the trio have remained remarkably close, making sure they carve out time to catch up with one another over a drink or a meal together.“Tom lives round the corner from me in Hackney, so when we can, we’ll pop to the local pub for a quick pint,” says William, the eldest at 38. “Olivia is in Shepherd’s Bush, so when we’re all in London at the same time, we meet for Sunday lunch at Tom’s restaurant.” Tom’s style of cooking is ideal for a big family get-together. “I love food you can pass around and make conversation about,” he says.If most siblings experience some degree of rivalry growing up, the Oldroyds insist that wasn’t the case for them. It’s not difficult to believe. They share a natural optimism, talk about one another’s achievements with obvious pride and say that, first and foremost, they’re friends. “We’re very supportive of one another, and we get on really well,” says Olivia, 35.With two years separating each sibling from the next, there were inevitable squabbles during their childhood, but they were always a tight-knit unit. They grew up in Guildford, in a house opposite their primary school, where their mother was a teacher. Tom called her “Mrs Mummy”. Credit for their lack of competitiveness goes to their parents, who encouraged each of them to pursue their own interests.“Will was always the most academic – he went to the local grammar school – whereas I had a short attention  and went to a state school,” says Tom. “But our mum and dad never pressured any of us to follow a particular path. They supported us in whatever we wanted to do. Will always had a passion for theatre and Olivia was always very artistic. I was looking for something creative, too.”William went to Durham University to study theology, but while he was there, he realised directing was his calling. After moving to London, he worked as an assistant at the Almeida and the Barbican before winning a directing residency at the Young Vic theatre and going on to stage productions around the world.Tom was initially unsure where his own passion would take him. “I always loved food, and watched Ready, Steady, Cook religiously growing up, but I didn’t want to be a chef,” he says. “I worked in hotels after leaving school and all I saw was chefs microwaving everything.”William and Olivia have vivid memories of Tom’s teenage experiments in the kitchen. “He went through a phase of making pea soup all the time, and it was delicious,” says Olivia. “He always had the knack of being able to open the fridge and make something simple but lovely out of whatever was in there.”It was after studying hospitality management as a mature student at Surrey University that Tom began working as a chef, getting a job at Alastair Little’s restaurant in Soho. When William went to eat there for the first time, he says: “I felt very proud to sit in a restaurant where Tom was cooking the food.” He worked his way up, then spent six months at trendy Italian restaurant Bocca di Lupo before being recruited as the head chef at Polpo, Russell Norman’s new venture, in 2009. As always, he included his siblings in his achievement.“I remember us going to his flat and him cooking us a sample menu on the small hob, because he’s always wanted our opinion,” says William. “Equally, I often think of Tom and Olivia when I’m working – what they’d like. It stops me getting too lost in what I like.”After her MA in history of art at Sussex University, Olivia joined them in London. Watching her older brothers work so hard to make their ambitions a reality made her more determined to fulfil her own. “Their work ethic is definitely the biggest thing I learned from them,” she says.In 2013, the trio began living together in a house in Shepherd’s Bush, where they were joined by Olivia’s boyfriend and Tom’s fiancee, Meryl Fernandes, an actress and television presenter. “People did think it was a bit weird that we all lived together,” says Olivia with a laugh. “But it was great. We have a similar sense of humour and we have fun together.” William would come to her for advice on his love life, while Tom taught her how to season her cooking properly. The arrangement lasted two years before Tom and William moved to east London. Tom now has a baby daughter with Meryl, who is overseeing the design of his new venture, a Hackney pub, The Duke of Richmond, where he’ll serve French dishes. Olivia is often out of the country preparing touring exhibitions and William is working on several early stage film projects.However busy life becomes, they’ll always make time to support one another’s projects. “They’re so talented,” says William. “It’s fantastic to see the outcome of their hard work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f04798d1cf5294df185fce2a94d2753dfb4590e3/0_93_4240_2545/master/4240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38bc075bfa5fce15fe0cfc9bd0f3566e","title":"emmys 2018 game of thrones makes a triumphant return on tvs biggest night","story":"Netflix and HBO wound up dead-locked with 23 wins each, while The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and The Assassination of Gianni Versace emerged victoriousEmmy winners 2018: the full listAfter its absence from last year’s ceremony, Game of Thrones returned to the 70th annual primetime Emmys to take home the night’s biggest award: outstanding drama series. HBO’s sprawling fantasia, whose upcoming eighth season will be its last, won six other awards for its makeup, costumes, music composition and stunt coordination.The television academy did manage to spread the love in the drama categories, awarding The Americans for its writing and lead actor (Matthew Rhys), The Crown for directing and lead actress (Claire Foy), Peter Dinklage for his supporting work in Game of Thrones, and Thandie Newton for her role in Westworld. “I don’t even believe in God but I’m going to thank her tonight,” said Newton, who plays the robot mutineer Maeve Millay in HBO’s sci-fi hit.Before anyone began doling out awards, the night was shaping up to be a two-way horse race between HBO and Netflix, with 108 and 112 respective nominations. Accounting for wins at last weekend’s Creative Arts Emmy’s, HBO began the night with a slim 17-16 lead. Netflix, however, briefly took the lead on the shoulders of strong showings for the limited series Godless (for which Jeff Daniels and Merritt Wever won as supporting actor and actress) as well as The Crown, Black Mirror, Seven Seconds and John Mulaney’s stand-up special, Kid Gorgeous.When Thrones took home the night’s last award, HBO pulled even, matching Netflix with 23 awards. Hulu, which last year became the first streaming service to win best drama award for The Handmaid’s Tale, had a disappointing night, leaving the live broadcast empty-handed (Samira Wiley, though, did win for the award for best guest actress in a drama series).FX, a longtime incubator for prestige television often passed over at the awards shows, made considerable inroads, with The Americans star Matthew Rhys winning best lead actor in a drama series for his work in the show’s final season.Another FX series, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, captured several gongs: the show itself won best limited series, while Darren Criss won best actor in a limited series for his tortured turn as the serial killer Andrew Cunanan. Show-runner Ryan Murphy was recognized for directing the show’s pilot, dedicating the award to “Jeff and David and Gianni,” a reference to three of Cunanan’s real-life victims.Amazon’s period-comedy breakout The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, which follows a Jewish housewife turned stand-up comic played by Rachel Brosnahan, took home the big kahuna, outstanding comedy series, and swept the awards for lead actress, supporting actress (Alex Borstein), comedy writing and comedy directing in a year where Emmys juggernaut Veep was ineligible. Surprisingly, FX’s critically acclaimed satirical comedy Atlanta, for which Donald Glover won best actor last year, won just two awards on 13 nominations (for guest actor Katt Williams and cinematographer Christian Sprenger).Brosnahan, referencing her character Midge Maisel’s journey in the show, used her acceptance speech to encourage viewers to get to the polls this November. “One of the most important ways to find and use your voice is to vote,” said the first-time Emmy winner, who was also awarded for her work on the show at this year’s Golden Globes. In a bit of history-making, showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino became the first woman to ever win the awards for both writing and directing a comedy series.HBO’s black comedy Barry swooped in to take home two awards where Maisel either faltered or wasn’t nominated – Bill Hader, playing the titular hitman, won for lead actor, while his co-star Henry Winkler finally won an Emmy after being nominated five times before.Claire Foy, having finished her run as Queen Elizabeth in Netflix’s The Crown, took home best actress in a drama series, upsetting co-favorites Elisabeth Moss and Sandra Oh, plus Keri Russell, who many expected to be recognized for her last season as Elizabeth Jennings in The Americans. The Crown won one other award, for the direction of the second season’s ninth episode, Paterfamilias. In the category of lead actress in a limited series or movie, Regina King, nominated for her role in the Netflix crime drama Seven Seconds, came away with a shock victory over Laura Dern, who was heavily favored to win for her turn in the HBO movie The Tale.Before hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che began proceedings, the show opened with a song and dance courtesy of Kate McKinnon, Kenan Thompson, Kristen Bell, Tituss Burgess, Ricky Martin, Sterling K Brown, John Legend and RuPaul, who joked about Hollywood having “solved” its ersity problem with this year’s crop of nominees.The night was short on overt Trump barbs but heavy on politics: in their opening monologue, Jost and Che remarked that the first Emmy awards took place all the way back in 1949, “when we all agreed Nazis were bad”. Invoking the cancellation of the ABC sitcom Roseanne after its eponymous star tweeted racist remarks about former Obama administration official Valerie Jarrett, Che quipped: “Roseanne cancelled herself but got picked up by white nationalists.” The duo, who together host SNL’s weekend update, recruited Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen to share nuggets of information about Emmy’s history, a task they were (deliberately) woefully unprepared to meet.Che also appeared in a pre-recorded segment called the Reparation Emmys, in which he gave out belated awards to the stars of black sitcoms overlooked by the Academy such as Marla Gibbs (The Jeffersons), Jimmy Walker (Good Times), and Kadeem Hardison (A Different World).Eight-time Emmy winner (and 24-time nominee) Betty White made an appearance at the ceremony, reminiscing on a career whose high-water marks, like the sitcoms The Golden Girls and The Mary Tyler Moore Show, have cemented the 96-year-old as a titan of comedy. “It’s incredible that I’m still in this business, and you are putting up with me,” she said to a standing ovation, with SNL stars Kate McKinnon and Alex Baldwin to her left. “All I can say is, it’s such a pleasant business to be in, and how lucky can I be?”But perhaps the most heartwarming moment of the ceremony came when Glenn Weiss, honored for directing the 2018 Oscars broadcast, used his acceptance speech to recognize his mother, who recently passed away. Weiss then proposed to his girlfriend, Jan Svendsen, who sat in the crowd unassumingly before taking to the stage as Weiss got on one knee. “You wonder why I don’t call you my girlfriend?,” he asked as the crowd cheered him on. “It’s because I want to call you my wife.”Elsewhere, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver won outstanding variety talk series for a third consecutive year. RuPaul’s Drag Race, in its tenth season, was finally recognized by the Academy for outstanding reality competition program, leading to the evening’s most rousing acceptance speech. “Listen, if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?,” said RuPaul, surrounded by castmates and crew. “Can I get an amen in here?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3ba0167a17a7334c5381e39b288465a230491c1/0_74_4969_2983/master/4969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac62b711d2c0b17a778f328379a4cfb6","title":"emmys 2018 a steady shake up as tvs underdogs get their dues","story":"The awards show finally recognised some of TV’s most underrated shows, from The Americans to The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, on an unconventional nightFor its 70th anniversary, the Emmys was warm, open and largely steered clear of overt political gestures, instead turning its humour back on television itself. That was a step-change from the 2017 ceremony.The most memorable moment from last year’s ceremony was also its most controversial. That was when Sean Spicer sent up his own grasp of “alternative facts”, to the distaste of many viewers, who found his invitation unpalatable. This year, the standout moment was a marriage proposal from the director of the Oscars, who gave a moving speech about the death of his mother before he asked his girlfriend to marry him.Many of this year’s gags came at the industry’s expense. The opening number, by Saturday Night Live’s Kate McKinnon and Kenan Thompson, was called We Solved It!, which paid tribute to the fact that this was the most erse list of nominees ever and mocked Hollywood’s self-congratulatory tendencies, which turned out to be ironic, as the first 10 awards were given to white people.The hosts, Colin Jost and Michael Che, performed their opening monologue as an extended series of zingers in the style of their regular SNL Weekend Update slot. They targeted the Emmys themselves, welcoming “the hundreds watching at home” and promising that, with quality like this, television could keep going “for another … five or six years”. They acknowledged the dominance of Netflix, which ended up in a tie with HBO as the biggest winner of the night with 23 wins and paid nostalgic tribute to the first ever ceremony in 1949, “when we all agreed that Nazis were bad”. It certainly played to the audience, whose acute awareness of its insularity was one of the themes of the night (“This room is so erse, from Democrat to liberal Democrat …”).It is extraordinary to think that the timing of the Emmys mean that last year’s ceremony took place before the Weinstein allegations had surfaced and before #MeToo had become a movement. Over the past 11 months, we have seen awards ceremonies showcasing fiery speeches, angry speeches and moving speeches, but the speed at which this has all galloped has been so astonishing that #TimesUp was mentioned briefly as a punchline, when The Marvelous Mrs Maisel’s creator and showrunner, Amy Sherman-Palladino, had a pop at the expense of the flooring: “Whoever put that carpet down hates women. I just want to say that right away. Time’s up, OK?”In fact, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel trounced the comedy competition and was the bona fide break-out star of the night, winning five awards: outstanding comedy series, lead actress in a comedy for Rachel Brosnahan, supporting actress in a comedy for Alex Borstein, outstanding writing in a comedy series and outstanding directing in a comedy series. It’s a gorgeous and charming show and it’s always a thrill to see a new series coming through in such an emphatic way.Often, the Emmys can feel like ticking off a list, in terms of doling out rewards as expected. A fair few of the categories did go that way: of course Game of Thrones took a running leap into its final season with awards to spare, The Americans was seen off in style and The Crown was honoured for its sort-of series finale – before the Olivia Colman era begins. But there were other series which, like Mrs Maisel, haven’t quite endured the full Bodyguard level of analysis and overindulgence and yet still walked away victorious. Netflix’s endurance western Godless won acting plaudits for Jeff Daniels and Merritt Weaver, and Barry won big for Henry Winkler and Bill Hader. It was also a year that celebrated internet-watercooler shows, with Black Mirror, Queer Eye and RuPaul’s Drag Race scoring deserved, and, in RuPaul’s case, long overdue, wins.As much as the humour was self-deprecating, the spread of the awards all felt very fair. Even the snubs were relatively gentle. I would have loved to have seen Sandra Oh win best actress for Killing Eve, though perhaps Claire Foy, who did win, would have, too, as she told Oh how much she loved her in her acceptance speech. Last year’s big successes, Atlanta and The Handmaid’s Tale, faded away, and the hype for Netflix’s Glow failed to materialise into any prizes. But that really was the extent of it and there were no true causes for outrage. It wasn’t exactly the triumph of the underdog, then, but there was a sense that this was a shake-up, if a shake-up of the steady variety."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e170672ca337d6110b79fa69473692d7cbbde819/0_92_4216_2530/master/4216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0431de7ed74fdc12dc7322b4b1b7e6ca","title":"brett kavanaugh accuser testify senate committee","story":"The supreme court nominee and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexually assaulting her, have been called to testifyDonald Trump’s supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman accusing him of sexual assault have been invited to testify in an extraordinary public hearing that could determine the fate of his confirmation.Under immense pressure, Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the Senate judiciary committee, said his panel would hold a hearing next Monday with both Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged that he sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers in high school.“To provide ample transparency, we will hold a public hearing Monday to give these recent allegations a full airing,” Grassley said in a written statement, as Republican leaders attempt to prevent the accusation from sinking Kavanaugh’s nomination.Ford’s allegation, made in the Washington Post on Sunday, plunged Kavanaugh’s nomination into uncertainty, delaying a committee vote on his confirmation that had been scheduled for Thursday. But Republicans, including the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, remained defiant that the process would move forward.Trump said the nominee “looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation” and stands ready to testify as soon as the panel calls him.Trump defended Kavanaugh earlier on Monday, calling him “one of the finest people I’ve ever known” while saying he did not have a problem with delaying the vote.“If it takes a little delay, it’ll take a little delay,” he told reporters. He added: “They’ll go through a process and hear everybody out. I think it’s important.”Asked if Kavanaugh had offered to withdraw his nomination, Trump did not answer directly, simply responding: “What a ridiculous question.”Ford, 51, is a research psychologist at Palo Alto University in northern California. Speaking to the Post, she described an incident she said happened when she and Kavanaugh were in high school in the early 1980s.She alleged that Kavanaugh and a friend – both “stumbling drunk” – corralled her into a bedroom at a party. Kavanaugh then pinned her on a bed, she said, groping her and placing his hand over her mouth. Ford said she was able to escape only when the friend jumped on top of them.In a statement released by the White House on Monday, Kavanaugh issued a fresh denial of the claims: “I have never done anything like what the accuser describes – to her or to anyone.“Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. I am willing to talk to the Senate judiciary committee in any way the committee deems appropriate to refute this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity.”Ford’s lawyer, Debra Katz, told NBC’s Today Show her client was “willing to do whatever it takes to get her story forth”.Republicans hope to confirm Kavanaugh before the midterm elections in November, when their Senate majority could be at risk. But by midday a growing number of Republicans had sought to delay the vote until senators had more time to examine the claims.Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican on the committee who called for the vote to be delayed, said a public hearing was the “best route forward”.“Obviously these are serious charges, and if they’re true, I think that they’re disqualifying,” he told reporters.Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a senior judiciary committee member and strong Republican supporter of Kavanaugh, said he spoke on Monday to Kavanaugh, who said he was not present at the party where the alleged assault occurred.Hatch said: “I’ve known him for a long time, he’s always been straightforward, honest, truthful, and a very, very decent man.”Democrats have called for the FBI to handle the matter by reopening Kavanaugh’s background investigation.“Republicans and their staff cannot investigate these allegations,” the Senate minority leader, Charles Schumer, said in remarks on the Senate floor. “They’ve already said they’re not true.”Republican leadership meanwhile fumed at Democrats for not previously disclosing this information, during their one-on-one meetings with Kavanaugh or during his confirmation hearing, which drew raucous protests and partisan bickering earlier this month.“Now – at the 11th hour, with committee votes on the schedule, after Democrats have spent weeks and weeks searching for any possible reason that the nomination should be delayed,” McConnell said in remarks on the House floor.Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat, received a letter from Ford detailing the allegations in July, in which she asked for complete anonymity. In the interview with the Post, Ford said she decided to come forward publicly only after the allegations – and her identity – began to circulate.Feinstein and nine other Democrats on the committee have signed a letter demanding that the matter be turned over to the FBI to investigate rather than have members’ staff make phone calls.“In view of the enormity and seriousness of these allegations, a staff-only phone call behind closed doors is unacceptable and Democratic staff will not participate,” the letter said. “This isn’t how things should be done and is in complete violation of how this committee has worked in the past.”The allegations have raised the stakes for a handful of moderate Democratic senators and two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, all of whom were already undecided on Kavanaugh’s nomination. On Monday, Collins wrote on Twitter: “Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee.”The White House has sought to cast Kavanaugh as a champion for women. As the Ford allegation surfaced late last week, initially anonymously, a pro-Kavanaugh letter was published, signed by 65 women who said he had always “behaved honorably and treated women with respect”.The letter appears to have been orchestrated by confirmkavanaugh, a website funded by the Judicial Crisis Network, a group that relies upon undisclosed donations and backs conservatives for judgeships. The friend of Kavanaugh’s named in the Post report, the writer Mark Judge, said he had “no recollection” of the alleged events.In an interview with Fox \u0026amp Friends on Monday, White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway said it would be up to the Senate committee to decide if Ford speaks publicly or privately.“Let me make this very clear,” she said. “I’ve spoken to the president. I’ve spoken to Senator Graham and others. This woman will be heard.” Katz noted that her client had not wanted to come forward publicly and did so only after the accusations began to circulate late last week. separately obtained a letter that was sent to senators on the judiciary committee in July, in which a lawyer called for senators Grassley and Feinstein to offer whistleblower protection to a half dozen people who previously worked for Kavanaugh’s mentor and friend, Judge Alex Kozinski.Kozinski resigned from his powerful post at the chief just of the ninth circuit last year after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual harassment and - in some cases – assault. Kozinski resigned and did not dispute the allegations, but said he had been misunderstood.During his confirmation hearing last week, Kavanaugh said he had no knowledge of Kozinski’s allegedly abusive behaviour towards clerks. Former clerks for Kozinski have told the  Kozinski’s behaviour was an “open secret”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a7cac7edbf167638e4247bbe237c76c37ae96a/0_11_3386_2030/master/3386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9db797e5921551fc57c50f8c00857b5","title":"cristina fernandez indicted argentina president corruption","story":"Judge’s indictment alleges corruption network was set up by Néstor Kirchner and his wife took over when he died"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5ee1d0ef338db5284cd1f2554c8ee0f488f281b/0_501_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8efa8dd0e5bceb0e26705d80d1244541","title":"hurricane florence north carolina recovery","story":"Hurricane Florence has depleted the town of Wilmington, emotionally exhausting its residents and respondersTwo people, after waiting more than three hours in 90-degree weather for freshly made ice, had just fainted, a group of people said, pointing to an ambulance pulled up by the side of the gas station.More than a hundred onlookers standing next to coolers in shorts and flip flops watched the first responders help a woman sit down.

When responding please make sure you put your safety and the safety of others first. Extreme weather events can be very unpredictable and carry very real risks For the first time in a week since before Hurricane Florence took the town apart, the sun came out in Wilmington and brought a new set of problems. It’s now boiling hot and many people here in this stricken North Carolina city don’t have air conditioning or enough gas for the generators to turn on fans.Hurricane Florence has consumed the town physically and exhausted its residents and responders emotionally. Every conversation is one of survival, how families are faring and how they will cope in the weeks and months ahead.Downed power lines were tangled in tree limbs. Pool-sized bodies of water created by Florence cut off entire streets, and sometimes, neighborhoods from the rest of Wilmington. And now the town – which was cut off from the rest of the state over the weekend – is in survival mode, even if a roadway in has been opened by emergency workers.Next to a 200 car long line for gas, Michael Horner sat helplessly at a closed gas station. He can’t idle or start and stop his car for four hours because his tank is on empty.On top of being stranded in his car, Horner had no power at home and three windows were knocked down, letting in a torrent of rain over three days.“I am trapped, I’m stuck here,” he said resignedly.A few feet away, at a functioning gas station, Jerry Murrell sat patiently in his white pickup truck. He was next in line to refill and it had taken four hours. “I’m an original, been here since ’49 and this one right here is gonna rank right up there with Bertha because then, it took a week to get power. This time, it’s going to be a while.”He didn’t want to wait for gas, but his house was damp, without air and he had no choice but to air it out. “I had to turn the air conditioning on to keep the moisture out of the house.”Murrell is one of the lucky ones. Down the road at a Harris Teeter grocery store, a man sleeping in the Hoggard High School shelter picked up bananas and sat at the tables by Starbucks. He had nowhere else to go and it was one of the few places with air conditioning as temperatures rose.As the water slowly recedes under the glaring blaze of sweltering sunlight, survival in Wilmington is most crucial as getting food and clean water become paramount.In front of National Food market, Jesseca Toamani carried her five-week old son, Harris, back into the pickup truck while her husband bought snacks at the convenience store. The bees had come out after the rain and Harris needed some protection. “I couldn’t wait in line at the Harris Teeter, it was too long,” she said, putting the pacifier in the baby’s mouth as he wailed. His light blue onesie looked too warm in the sweltering heat. She fanned Harris as his cheeks turned red.Residents weren’t the only ones frustrated with the recovery process. A group of men, coming in from other parts of North Carolina, have descended on Wilmington. Parked in the road, next to two piles of 50-foot trees cut into 2-foot chunks, they ask drivers in passing cars if they need help, clearing roads and yards.“Fema called us but we didn’t want to come with them,” Al Lewis said, leaning against the truck. The dozen men with him, clad in overalls and baseball caps, bobbed their heads up and down in agreement. Though they have worked straight through the night, that’s not the part that bothered them about the backbreaking work of helping those trapped by trees and power lines.They say most residents of the town are starting the recovery by themselves as the official response is still lagging.“I’ve been to every hurricane there is. They had food on every corner they had stuff. They come together down in Texas. They come together good. Out here, they ain’t together. They ain’t got food, they ain’t got water, they got nothing,” he said.He and his crew haven’t been able to find gas in four days, just like most people in Wilmington. “We’re out here roughing it,” Lewis said.Five streets over, a man jumped out of a City of Wilmington truck. He picked up a fallen street sign and banged it back into the ground, looking satisfied with his handiwork.But for many of those stuck in Wilmington, in the stifling heat, such acts are barely the beginning of the recovery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9170dda6624b7250d060ae9ce65f880b25eccda/82_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a29ae902173906a7dfdb90197b8274ea","title":"kim jong un greets moon jae in as inter korean summit starts","story":"Leaders take part in highly choreographed opening to three days of talks in Pyongyang, North KoreaKim Jong-un has greeted the South Korean president to cheers from crowds assembled at North Korea’s Pyongyang airport as the pair begin their third summit.The North Korean leader emerged from the airport building to raucous cheering and walked up to President Moon Jae-in.

Because of that, the regional political situation has been stabilized and more progress is expected,”\u0026nbspKim\u0026nbspsaid, according to South Korean media pool reports.Moon\u0026nbspresponded by expressing his own thanks to\u0026nbspKim\u0026nbspfor making a “bold decision” in a New Year’s speech to open a new era of detente and send a delegation to the South Korean Winter Olympics in February.During a conversation at the Paekhwawon guest house where\u0026nbspMoon\u0026nbspwas to stay,\u0026nbspKim\u0026nbspsaid North Koreans hope diplomacy will yield positive results. “I think it was our people’s wish that we come up with good results as fast as we can,”\u0026nbspKim\u0026nbspsaid, according to the media pool reports.Moon\u0026nbspresponded that “Our hearts are fluttering, but at the same we have heavy hearts,” and added, “We have built trust and friendship between us, so I think all will be well.”Kim was accompanied at the airport by his wife, Ri Sol-ju, and his sister and close adviser Kim Yo-jong. Moon and Kim Jong-un also reviewed a North Korean honour guard of soldiers before a loudly cheering crowd of North Korean men in dark suits and women wearing hanbok – Korean national dress. They hoisted North Korean flags, flowers and flags depicting a unified Korean peninsula in blue against a white background.The huge civilian entourage Seoul sent to the summit includes the third-generation heir of South Korea’s largest business group and Ailee, a Colorado-born pop a nicknamed the “Korean Beyonce”.The crowd appeared bored as they waited but then seemed almost hysterical at the sight of Kim. The entire ceremony lasted about 15 minutes before Moon and Kim drove off in a caravan of black cars and the crowd quickly returned to its previously calm state.As the pair drove through the streets of Pyongyang, well-dressed crowds lined the roads and shouted their desire for unification as Moon and Kim waved from the top of a black limousine. The trip is the first visit by a South Korean president in 11 years.They later arrived at a guesthouse in Pyongyang where they were expected to have talks over lunch. Kim and Moon arrived at the Paekhwawon State Guesthouse in a black Mercedes convertible and were seen talking and adjusting their hair before stepping out of the backseat.North Korea’s nuclear programme is at the top of Moon’s agenda as he tries to get Kim to provide details on his previous commitment to the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”. Negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington have stalled since Kim met Donald Trump in Singapore in June, with Kim only offering vague pronouncements and little substance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7efb756cee16936ddfbb92b6c7780a045bbe34a2/0_80_4098_2459/master/4098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=342cdce8cc39afb4e4b2c5ad76dbc49b","title":"russia military aircraft syria jet lost contact","story":"Kremlin blames ‘irresponsible’ Israeli actions for downing of aircraft carrying 15 peopleA Russian military aircraft with 15 people onboard has been accidentally shot down by allied Syrian anti-aircraft defences that were targeting Israeli jets, the Russian defence ministry has said.The ministry blamed Israel’s “irresponsible actions” for the incident, saying Israeli fighter jet pilots intentionally used the aircraft as cover against Syrian missiles in a “deliberate provocation”.An eight-vessel search for the Russian Il-20, a surveillance plane, was initiated after contact was lost about 20 miles (35km) off the coast of Syria at about 11pm local time (8pm GMT) on Monday. Russia said it had located the wreckage and some remains of the personnel onboard. No survivors had been found early on Tuesday afternoon.In a statement, a Russian military spokesman said Israeli F-16 pilots were using the Russian plane as a shield while carrying out missile strikes against targets in Syria’s Latakia province and put it in the line of fire from Syrian anti-aircraft batteries.“The Il-20, which has a much bigger reflective surface than the F-16, was struck down by an S-200 rocket,” the spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, said. “We retain the right to an appropriate response,” he added, without giving details on whether that response could include military action.Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, told a senior Israeli official that Israel bore “full responsibility” for the incident and the death of the Russian crew, a military spokesman said later on Tuesday. In a telephone call with his Israeli counterpart, Avigdor Lieberman, Shoigu said the Israeli actions were viewed as “hostile” and that Moscow had repeatedly warned Israel not to carry out strikes against Syria that endangered Russian servicemen. Israel’s ambassador in Moscow has been summoned to the Russian foreign ministry over the incident.\u0026nbspDamascus said its anti-air batteries had fired at incoming missiles that were heading towards several locations in the coastal city of Latakia.“Air defences have confronted enemy missiles coming from the sea in the direction of Latakia city, and intercepted a number of them,” the state news agency Sana quoted a military source as saying.A US official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the US government believed Syrian defences may have accidentally shot down the Russian aircraft while firing at incoming Israeli missiles. Hmeimim airbase, the Russian-operated facility in Syria to which the missing plane was returning, is located south-east of Latakia city.“The missiles were not fired by the US military and we have nothing further at this time,” a spokesperson for the Pentagon told the . France also denied involvement after Russia said it was mounting attacks on Syria targets at the time of the incident.The Israeli military, contacted before Russia said it was to blame, said it did not comment on “foreign reports”. For several years, Israel and Russia have maintained a special hotline to prevent their air forces from clashing in the skies over Syria. Israeli military officials have previously praised its effectiveness.As well as the hotline, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made trips to Moscow to seek to convince President Vladimir Putin not to supply Assad with Russian-made anti-aircraft defences that might endanger Israeli jets on sorties.Russia said Israel had given only one minute’s warning before launching missile strikes against the Syrian coast. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict, said huge explosions were heard in Latakia on Monday night, wounding more than 10 people, whom they identified as “regime forces and military personnel”.Russia’s military operation in Syria, which began in late 2015, has turned the tide of the conflict in favour of Moscow’s ally, the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, in his fight against rebels.At the same time, Israel’s air force has launched scores of attacks on Syrian territory in a campaign it says is to prevent its arch-enemy and Assad’s ally, Iran, from gaining a military foothold in a neighbouring country. The strikes have also targeted arms shipments in Syria to Lebanon’s Tehran-backed Hezbollah movement.In April, France joined the US and Britain to launch more than 100 missiles at what they said were Syrian chemical weapons facilities in retaliation for a suspected poison attack. A senior French army chief said this month that Paris was ready to strike again under similar circumstances.The Kremlin played down speculation that the incident could affect its ability to strike deals among rival sides in the Syrian conflict. Russia has sought to trade on its influence with the Syrian and Iranian governments, and Israel has lobbied Russia to push back against growing Iranian influence in Syria, particularly near the Israeli border.Russia publicly deployed military police to the Golan Heights frontier between Syria and Israel last month amid heightened tensions in the area. The deployment of advanced Russian air defence systems to Syria have also raised concerns about the safety of Israeli forces acting in the area.Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said on Tuesday said recent agreements with Turkey about de-escalation zones near the rebel stronghold of Idlib would be unaffected by the downing of the plane."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f093bfdbfd464d52d1bb445ee66b58aec0f9cae2/0_3_1575_945/master/1575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eba292f072f445d38910c9ad91f3f7e9","title":"sajid javid secrecy application alexander perepilichnyy","story":"Disclosures in Perepilichnyy case ‘would raise risk of harm to one or more public interests’Sensitive material that could reveal if a Russian millionaire was working with British spies before he died will not be made public at his inquest, a coroner has ruled.Sajid Javid lodged a secrecy application at the inquest into the death of Alexander Perepilichnyy citing national security concerns. The 44-year-old collapsed and died while jogging near his home in Weybridge, Surrey, in 2012.Lawyers acting for the life insurers Legal \u0026amp General told the Old Bailey the businessman could have been “rubbed out” if he was working for British spies and that evidence of any links to UK intelligence services could show he was in “special danger”.Andrew O’Connor QC, for the government, said the disclosure of sensitive material raised a “real risk of serious harm to one or more public interests”.The coroner, Nicholas Hilliard QC, heard details of the home secretary’s public interest immunity (PII) application in private in June. In a written ruling, the coroner said the documents in question were not required for the inquest.Hilliard has been examining whether the wealthy executive was murdered with poison or died of natural causes.The coroner said he had considered whether the material contained anything “which was not otherwise publicly available” and had “significant bearing on or connection with” the issues he had to decide upon. “I am satisfied here that the answer to both questions is no,” he said.Before his death, Perepilichnyy had been helping the UK-based campaigner Bill Browder’s Hermitage Capital investment fund to expose a $230m money-laundering operation.Bob Moxon Browne QC, for Legal \u0026amp General, told the court his concern about Javid’s application was “whether or not British police or the government have evidence that Mr Perepilichnyy was, prior to his death, working for or in contact with British intelligence”.He argued there should be an exception to the rule of neither confirming nor denying contact with security services in Perepilichnyy’s case.Moxon Browne cited the poisoning of the former double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March as demonstration of “the lengths to which the Russian state are prepared to go to make an example or punish people perceived as enemies, traitors or turncoats”.He said the public was told of Alexander Litvinenko’s role with British intelligence after he was fatally poisoned.If it also was true in the case of Perepilichnyy, it would be, he said, “very powerful evidence indeed that he might have been in special danger from those who wish him ill because of the perception he was a traitor or a turncoat or enemy of Russia”.The inquest had also heard how Buzzfeed reported that high-grade US intelligence indicated that Perepilichnyy was likely assassinated on direct orders of Vladimir Putin or those close to him.No application was made for American intelligence to be withheld, after the US dismissed the claims.The inquest is due to continue on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cf989ff8562ee1165adb5b04a210442463cb314/529_66_6797_4079/master/6797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=425e1ef0cb7b9f28a1b862cd7c67d3e3","title":"women of the world nomad games in pictures","story":"This year’s World Nomad Games, a celebration of nomadic heritage, took place in the Issyk-Kul province of Kyrgyzstan.

Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPAAnother false dawn? Or are prospects for a Brexit backstop deal as promising as some in London suggest? Can this week’s Salzburg summit really see a breakthrough?News reports have been hinting at a new flexibility on the part of EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier to give Theresa May a break, a new willingness, supposedly, to embrace British proposals on how to deal with the problem of maintaining a frictionless border on the island of Ireland.But there’s a strong element of “pot-half-full-or-half-empty”, wishful thinking emanating from London, and a glossing over of the essential principle of the EU position – still firmly maintained by Barnier – that Northern Ireland will have to be treated separately from the rest of the UK. That it is a case apart.That is what the UK has been resisting strenuously because of the implication, as the DUP sees it, of a “border” on the Irish Sea. The UK alternative is for the whole of the UK to maintain sufficient regulatory alignment with the EU to make separate treatment for Northern Ireland unnecessary.The problem is that such a solution would entail serious “cherry picking” of EU single market rules, a prospect adamantly opposed by the EU 27. Except, they say, in respect of the “small” territory of Northern Ireland in the interest of safeguarding the peace process.Barnier has for weeks been trying to “de-dramatise” the commission’s proposals to make its solution palatable and politically unthreatening to unionists by making it clear that the EU has no ambitions to change the constitutional position of the North.He gave a lengthy explanation of his views on September 3rd at the Commons Brexit committee.“We are ready to simplify these checks, to have them carried out at a number of different places and have checks, thanks to technical means, which could take different forms,” he told MPs.Controls on the flow of goods or animals and animal products, don’t have to imply a political border, or be on a border, he said. They already exist on the Irish Sea for agricultural products.And regulatory controls to ensure goods going into Northern Ireland comply with single market rules might happen at ports, on ships, or even at the factories where the goods are produced.The commission has even embraced a willingness to look at British proposals, suggested last summer and known as “MaxFac”, or “maximum facilitation” as part of the solution – trusted trader schemes, technological monitoring of goods movements, and special arrangements for small, border businesses.“We need to see how and when and where these controls would take place,” Barnier told the Commons. “They could be dispersed. They could take place in different places, on board vessels, in ports outside Ireland, they could be done using technological means, they could be dispersed, as I said, or simplified in technological terms.“Just to make that absolutely clear, we are not talking about a border. We are talking about controls. Some of these controls are already carried out in Northern Ireland on products coming from Great Britain. For example, plant-health checks, veterinary checks, animal checks.”Among the reassurances apparently given to London, the Financial Times claims, is that they could all be handled by UK customs officials without requiring EU officials in tow.Although the commission negotiating taskforce – and indeed the Irish, most vociferously – had previously insisted that the MaxFac measures would not be adequate to guarantee the integrity of the single market and police a UK-EU border regime, it appears that there is a willingness in Brussels to consider them as part of a Northern Ireland backstop solution.The commission, in effect, is turning the tables on the UK, calling its bluff: “You like MaxFac? Fair enough. Now let’s try it out on our backstop . . . these are your proposals and they certainly minimise any requirement for a hard border. Which is what you say you want.”But, critically, the commission remains adamant that its willingness to bend or circumvent single market rules can only apply to Northern Ireland. London still has to bite that bullet and shows no inclination to do so, and certainly not ahead of Thursday’s Salzburg summit. Irish officials, moreover, remain confident that the meeting will see, if anything, a reinforcing of the strong political support by the 26 for Ireland’s position.\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is due to brief EU ministers, including Tánaiste Simon Coveney, on the remaining issues in the Brexit orce talks at a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday. Before leaving for Brussels, Mr Coveney briefed Cabinet on preparations for Brexit when the Government met on Tuesday morning. Among the negotiation issues to be discussed on Tuesday are the Irish Border and the framework for the UK’s future relationship with the EU. The Brussels meeting comes on the eve of a major summit in Salzburg, Austria, on Wednesday. British prime minister Theresa May will use that gathering to make a direct pitch to fellow leaders to back her isive Chequers proposals.UK Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said it was time for the “compromises” made by the UK to be “matched on the EU side”.In a sign that Brexit talks could go to the wire, the European Union is preparing for a final deal to be struck at an emergency summit in November, rather than the scheduled October meeting previously targeted by both sides in the negotiations.The deal has to be finalised well in advance of the UK’s March 29 2019 exit from the bloc so the parliaments in Westminster and Strasbourg can sign off on the agreement.Arriving at the Brussels meeting on Wednesday, Brexit minister Lord Callanan said: “If we are to get a deal there has to be compromises from both sides and we look forward to seeing what the EU side has to say about this.”The message echoed that from Mr Raab, who set out the UK’s position in an interview with journalists from newspapers across the EU.Setting out the UK’s hopes, Mr Raab said the Salzburg meeting at which Ms May is expected to briefly set out her position over dinner on Wednesday night before her 27 counterparts consider the situation in her absence on Thursday, would be “an important milestone” and “a stepping stone” to a deal.But he made clear the UK was looking for further movement from the EU on the Irish border.He branded Mr Barnier’s “backstop” proposals — which would see Northern Ireland remain in the EU customs area — unworkable, because they would create a border in the Irish Sea and fail to respect the constitutional integrity of the UK.“What I’m not going to do is to say that I would refuse to entertain any further proposals that the EU comes up with but they’ve got to be respecting the equities that we’ve set out,” he told correspondents from European newspapers including Germany’s Die Welt, France’s Le Monde and The .In a high-profile Panorama interview on Monday, Ms May framed the decision facing the country as a choice between her deal or no deal.But with large numbers of Tory hard Brexiteers openly rejecting the Chequers plan, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the scene was set for a second referendum.Sir Vince told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “I think growing numbers of people — we are already seeing it from senior Labour people and a few Conservatives — will say that the only way forward is to take this back to the public and say: ‘Do you accept what Theresa May has negotiated or would you rather stay in the European Union?”’A demonstration at the Labour conference in Liverpool on Sunday will add to pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to throw his weight behind calls for a second referendum.But Mr Raab rejected talk of a second vote, saying: “Even if that’s what people want to do, it’s difficult to see how it could be done in time, and we wouldn’t facilitate it.”European Council president Donald Tusk said he wanted to avoid the “catastrophe” of a no-deal Brexit.In a letter to EU leaders he said they should discuss arrangements for the “final phase” of the Brexit talks “including the possibility of calling another European Council in November”.He said the EU leaders should also reconfirm the need for a “legally operational backstop” on Ireland to avoid a hard border.Mr Tusk added that leaders should work on “limiting the damage” caused by Brexit.“Unfortunately, a no-deal scenario is still quite possible. But if we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe.”–Press AssociationDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It doesn’t make sense. Why is laughter considered so much cheaper than tears?”Plowman also relayed how dramas are much easier to sell to foreign markets, unlike comedies.

And what does it show about UK poverty?Click to followThe IndependentA UK food bank their use has shot up in recent yearsA group called the Social Metrics Commission (SMC) has come up with a new measure of UK poverty.But why do we need one? Who are the SMC?\u0026nbspWhat does this measure? And what does it show?Don’t we already have a poverty measure?Yes, but it’s not official and it’s contested.New Labour, which set out a target to “eradicate” child poverty and to “end” pensioner poverty, defined poverty (to simplify slightly)\u0026nbspas those living on less than 60 per cent share of the median average household income (before housing costs). This became widely known as “relative poverty”.The Child Poverty Act, introduced by Labour with cross-party support in 2010, committed the Government to reduce the proportion of children living in relative poverty to less than 10 per cent by 2020-21. \u0026nbspLabour’s redistribution did succeed\u0026nbspin reducing relative poverty considerably for both children and pensioners.For children the relative poverty rate fell from around 27\u0026nbspper cent in 1997 to 20 per cent in 2010.For pensioners, the rate fell from 25\u0026nbspper cent to 18 per cent over the same period.What happened under the Coalition?Protection for the state pension has meant that relative pensioner poverty now stands at around 17 per cent, still down on 2010.But cuts to tax credits mean, in particular further cuts to support for low-income families with more than two children,\u0026nbspsuggest\u0026nbspthat the rate is set to rise by 2022, pushing around one million more children into poverty.When it became clear that the impact of its austerity policies would be to increase poverty, the Coalition government began to question the New Labour definition.Conservative ministers argued that this was a crude measure and suggested there are better ways of measuring poverty than simply focusing on household income, such as by taking into account factors like worklessness, family breakdown, debt and drug and alcohol dependence.Critics accused the Government of moving the goalposts on poverty to avoid political embarrassment or to pull the wool over the public’s eyes about the impact of their welfare cuts.But even independent experts say that the relative income measure has flaws. For instance, whether one includes housing costs can have a dramatic impact on both the level and trends of the measure. The fact that it takes no account of assets is also not ideal, particular as low-income pensioners, for instance, may have relatively high assets to drawn on. The measure also tends to show a fall in poverty during recessions, as happened in 2008-09.So, amid this measurement debate, the Social Metrics Commission has now come up with a proposal which it says it hopes will provide a “new consensus” around measuring poverty.Is the SMC really impartial?It was established by the Baroness Stroud, a Tory peer and the head of the Legatum Institute, a think tank which has taken a very pro-Brexit line in recent years and has strong links with the Christian wing of the Conservative Party.Yet a representative of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation was also involved in the production of the report, a group associated with the left.It has also taken advice from respected welfare reform academics Professor Paul Gregg from the University of Bath and Robert Joyce of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.What does the new metric measure?It still measures income but, unlike the existing relative poverty measure, this new one takes some allowance of income from savings and assets.It also takes into account debt repayment costs and adjusts for the “inescapable” financial costs of disability and childcare.In addition it uses a three-year rolling average of the median income as a poverty benchmark (rather than a single year)\u0026nbspto curb distortions to the measure during recessions that hit most peoples’ incomes.What does it show?That the total number of people in poverty in the UK is 14.2 million. That’s around 4 million more than under the current before housing costs relative poverty measure.The most striking finding is just how prevalent poverty is among disabled people, with the group making up half of the 14.2 million total.Almost 60 per cent of people in poverty are also in “persistent” poverty, meaning they have been in that condition for at least two of the past three years.It also suggests far fewer pensioners than currently estimated – around 11 per cent of the total in 2017 – are in poverty.So is this a better measure which we should all start using?No measure is perfect, because they are inevitably subjective. And other research groups will, no doubt, critique it in the coming months.\u0026nbspOne element of the new measure likely to be controversial is that it suggests child poverty did not, in fact, fall under New Labour but started and ended at around 35 per cent.Yet the SMC’s effort has won some approval from some credible voices.“Those who this new proposed measure classifies as being in poverty align much more closely with those who report themselves as being materially deprived, in the sense of being unable to afford a number of specific items,” says Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, who did not personally sit on the Commission.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/28/10/oecd-0.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/28/10/oecd-0.jpg","title":"marsh mclennan jlt insurance takeover deal share price","story":"Created with Sketch.Shares in UK firm JLT\u0026nbspsoared by almost a third after deal announced, but thousands of jobs at riskClick to followThe IndependentBoth companies have headquarters in the City of LondonMarsh \u0026amp McLennan buys UK insurance firm JLT in $5.6bn dealFTSE 250 insurance firm JLT has accepted a $5.6bn (£4.3bn) takeover offer from US financial services giant Marsh \u0026amp McLennan.

The company said, however, it remains committed to its Swindon operation, which employs 4,000 people. The group uses millions of parts sourced from other EU countries at the Swindon plant, where the Civic is manufactured, and said a no-deal Brexit would create a “significant” burden in terms of bringing parts into the country, as well as delivering cars to the rest of Europe. Ian Howells,\u0026nbspHonda Europe’s senior vice president, told the BBC: “We’d probably be looking at something like 60,000 additional bits of documentation we would have to provide to get products to and from Europe.”He added: “If we end up with WTO tariffs, we’d have something like 10 per cent costs in addition to our shipped product back into Europe and that’d certainly run into tens of millions.“And likewise\u0026nbspwhen we’re looking at componentry coming the other way, again tens of millions in terms of tariffs potentially coming into the UK.”This would have an impact on productivity and competitiveness, Mr Howells said, particularly up against European rivals. However, the Swindon plant is the only place where the Civic is produced, so it would be a “very big decision to take a different approach”. Raab: Those fearing Brexit hit to car industry should show ‘mettle’Government urged to stop ‘squabbling’ and save UK car industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of Brexit“Really it hasn’t come up that we would actually have to look at putting Swindon elsewhere,” he said. “The logistics of moving a factory the size of Swindon would be huge and as far as we’re concerned, we’re right behind supporting continued production at Swindon.”The Honda executive’s remarks follow Jaguar Land Rover’s decision to move workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”. Ralf Speth, Jaguar’s boss, last week warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.He also said the current lack of clarity around Brexit means he does not know if his plants will be able to function after 29 March 2019, and added that interruptions to production could cost up to £60m a day.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/18/11/istock-855434066.jpg","title":"children air pollution school run playground health toxic vehicle emission","story":"Created with Sketch.Unicef\u0026nbspestimates that one in three children are growing up in towns and cities in the UK with unsafe levels of particulate pollutionClick to followThe IndependentChildren carried personal monitors which recorded black carbon over a 24-hour period during weekdays to assess their exposure on an average school dayChildren are most exposed to dangerous air\u0026nbsppollution\u0026nbspon the school run and\u0026nbspin the playground, experts have warned.While children\u0026nbsponly spend 40 per cent\u0026nbspof their time on the school run and at school, they receive 60 per cent\u0026nbspof their exposure to tiny particles of black carbon during those times, a study has found.Peaks in children\u0027s exposure to the\u0026nbsppollution\u0026nbspwere recorded while they travelling to and from school and during breaktime when they were likely to be in the playground, the report by Unicef UK and Queen Mary, University of London showed.Exposure to the pollutant, which can penetrate deep in the lungs, bloodstream and potentially the brain, and can stunt lung and brain growth and cause long term breathing conditions, is generally higher at school than when children are at home.Amy Gibbs,\u0026nbspUnicef\u0026nbspUK’s director of advocacy, said: Every day, thousands of children across the UK are setting off on a toxic school run that could impact their life and contribute to serious\u0026nbsplong-term\u0026nbsphealth problems.We cannot afford to continue to overlook this invisible but serious threat change is possible if the government acts now.It is critical that it sets out a clear strategy with sufficient funding to protect children from the harmful effects of toxic air, when and where they are proven to be most at risk.UK news in picturesIt\u0027s either my deal or no deal, the Prime Minister has said to the BBC\u0027s Nick Robinson in an interview on Panorama that airs this evening.

Whether it\u0027s burning only the cleanest fuels at home or leaving the car at home on the school run, everyone has a role to play in reducing air\u0026nbsppollution\u0026nbspand protecting the health of our children.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/15/14/may-interview-3.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3905566  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 17 September 2018  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/15/14/may-interview-3.jpg","title":"nursery rhyme late night mystery loudspeaker ipswich alarm spiders","story":"Created with Sketch.Unnerving tune woke up residents in Ipswich by\u0026nbspplaying over and over againClick to followThe IndependentMystery of eerie late-night nursery rhyme that haunted woman for months finally solvedA sinister recording of a children’s nursery rhyme being played repetitively late at night tormented a woman\u0026nbspfor over a year before investigators solved the mystery.Alice Randle was one of several residents who heard the creepy rendition of “It’s raining, it’s pouring”\u0026nbspcoming from somewhere outside their homes on the outskirts of Ipswich.Sometimes the tune played just once at 2am or 4am, but other times it repeated over and over again for hours.The rhyme, which relates the story of an old man who bumped his head and couldn’t wake up, left Ms Randle frightened and questioning whether she was imagining things.“It’s sung by what sounds like a very young child,” she told The Independent. “It’s very haunting, people have said it’s like something out of Freddie Krueger.”Rare jumping spider discovered in UK for first time everParents to receive advice on teaching nursery rhymes and alphabetIona Opie: Scholar of ‘The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes’ Ms Randle, who has two children,\u0026nbspfirst heard the nursery rhyme in September last year and initially tried to ignore it before finally calling Ipswich Borough Council in desperation two months ago.\u0026nbsp“The last couple of months I’ve been quite committed to finding out what it was,” she said. “I’ve been out with a friend of mine, we went on a mission, calling local businesses.”\u0026nbspThe council’s rapid response team drove out to the scene several times in an attempt to track down the noise only for it to fall silent before they got there.They finally tracked it down when Ms Randle called in after being woken up by the same recording at 11.15pm on 10 September.“It was only in the last couple of weeks that it started to play over and over again,” said Ms Randle. “I told them they would definitely hear it if they came this time.”The team arrived at her home in\u0026nbspBramford Road 15 minutes later.“We did hear the nursery rhyme playing and it sounded very eerie at that time of night,” a spokesperson\u0026nbspfor the council said.The\u0026nbspchild’s voice was being played through a loudspeaker on\u0026nbspa warehouse\u0026nbspa few hundred yards away on the Farthing Road industrial estate.“We don’t know at this stage why it is playing – it might be simply an alarm that is being triggered – but we will be visiting the operators to find out more,” the spokesperson added.“We appreciate that people living nearby would find it quite spooky.”Ms Randle said the owners of the site had told her that the nursery rhyme was being triggered by spiders.“When they examined the motion sensors there were\u0026nbspspiders and webs across it, so that’s how they know,” she added.A\u0026nbspspokesperson\u0026nbspfor the site\u0026nbsptold the\u0026nbspIpswich Star\u0026nbspnewspaper:\u0026nbsp“The sound is only supposed to act as a deterrent for opportunistic thieves that come onto our property, and it is designed only to be heard by people on our private land.“We are now aware of the problem – the motion sensors were being triggered by spiders crawling across the lenses of our cameras and it looks like we’ve had it turned up too loudly.“We’ve spoken to the resident who brought it to our attention and adjusted it so this should not happen again.”“It’s a massive relief and I’m looking forward to getting some actual sleep from now on,”\u0026nbspMs Randle said. “The last week has been lovely.”UK news in picturesIt\u0027s either my deal or no deal, the Prime Minister has said to the BBC\u0027s Nick Robinson in an interview on Panorama that airs this evening.

It follows two other sandstone reliefs – both of King Ptolemy V – being found there earlier this year.Ptolemy V, who ruled from 210BC until 180BC, is especially famed among ancient Egyptian leaders because his deeds are charted on the Rosetta Stone – which would eventually help modern-day experts learn to read hieroglyphs.The antiquities ministry says the temple of Kom Ombo was built during the reign of his son, Ptolemy VI.

We must lock in the economic progress that we have made, he said.As we leave the EU we must secure a close and enduring partnership with our European neighbours and we must heed the clear warnings of the IMF and others of the significant costs not reaching a deal with the EU will have for British jobs and British prosperity.Despite the contingency actions we are taking, leaving without a deal would put at risk the substantial progress the British people have made over the last 10 years.

UK financial services ARE READY for NO deal Brexit declares CEODespite two rate rises from the Bank of England, savers are not seeing much improvement in rates (Image: )The base rate was increased from 0.5 per cent in August, but consumer groups have accused providers of double standards when passing on the rate change to savers and borrowers.Charlotte Nelson, finance expert at Moneyfacts, said: \u0026ldquoIt is a sorry state of affairs that, despite two rate rises from the Bank of England, savers are still not seeing any real improvement in rates.\u0026ldquoIn fact, the average easy access account has only risen by 0.04 per cent since August 2016 and more shockingly, the average easy-access Isa has fallen over the last two years by 0.08 per cent.The situation is unlikely to improve until all the funding from Government schemes \u0026ndash such as the Term Funding Scheme \u0026ndash disappears and bigger banks stop trading off their names and offer savers a decent return, added Ms Nelson.However, savers continue to flock to easy-access accounts, ploughing \u0026pound18billion into them since the start of the year, figures from the Bank of England show.Millions of savers are still waiting for a fair deal  (Image: )Ms Nelson said: \u0026ldquoWith a substantial chunk of the easy-access market paying less than the base rate, it is likely a large proportion of this cash is sitting in poor-paying accounts.\u0026ldquoNow is not the time for savers to rest on their laurels.

But the banks had other ideas.\u0026ldquoIn the month since, long-suffering savers have been left wondering if they\u0026rsquoll see any boost at all as numerous banks and building societies refused to pass on the increase.\u0026ldquoWhile half of mortgage providers swiftly hiked their rates by the full amount, the vast majority of savings rates stayed the same.\u0026ldquoWhile homeowners quickly faced higher bills, savers missed out. And this double standard is now par for the course. It was the same last year after the previous rate rise.\u0026ldquoIn the worst cases, providers have readily hoisted mortgage rates by the full 0.25 per cent, but not passed on a single benefit to their savings customers.\u0026ldquoBanks and building societies have no good excuse for this behaviour.\u0026ldquoFor a banking sector still struggling to regain trust after the financial crisis, we must see fairness for consumers.Kate Smith, of investment specialists Aegon, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos disappointing but not unexpected to see the banks\u0026rsquo reluctance to pass on the interest rate to savers, while at the same time increasing mortgage rates.\u0026ldquoThese \u0026lsquodouble standards\u0026rsquo aren\u0026rsquot new but with the proportion of savings accounts on the market paying above the Bank of England base rate sinking to a five-year low, consumers are set to feel the effects on their savings in the long-run.\u0026ldquoConsumers should consider the full range of investment options available to them and weigh up whether or not they should move at least some funds out of cash savings accounts and into Isa stocks and shares.A spokeswoman for the lenders\u0026rsquo trade body UK Finance said: \u0026ldquoLast month\u0026rsquos rate rise will impact businesses and consumers in different ways depending on the nature of the lending and savings products they hold.\u0026ldquoBanks have made it easier for customers to shop around to get the best deal for them, including clearer communications about the rates they receive, faster cash Isa transfers and stronger customer prompts before a rate is reduced.\u0026ldquoAny customers looking for a better rate should always shop around to look for the best deals on offer.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remains closely tied to the Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May has agreed to an amendment that would stop Britain being tied to Europes customs union after we quit the EU.In dramatic scenes in the House of Commons on July 17 2018, Mrs May managed to see off a damaging attempt, winning by just six votes.Mrs May was then defeated on a separate amendment to her flagship Trade Bill, which will require her to seek continued UK participation in the EUs system for regulation of medicines after Brexit.Now her Cabinet is required to ensure that the UK can continue to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.A deal on the UKs withdrawal agreement was expected to be agreed in time for the summit in October, along with a statement from both sides on the future relationship.However, a number of senior figures have said this deadline may slide into November.Once a dead has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it.In a Panorama interview in September 2018 she said MPs had a simple choice between her Chequers plan or no deal.She told the BBC current affairs programme: I think that the alternative to that [the Chequers plan] will be not having a deal.The former Foreign Secretary claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of hard - Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees - Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis and Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004330278421.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"may must walk tall in the mountains sell brexit","story":"On Wednesday night in Salzburg, Austria, she will have a chance to try to persuade other EU leaders to bite on her plan for Britain’s future relationship with the bloc.The next morning EU leaders will meet without her, to decide on their response. May needs them to say or, preferably, do something that shows her plan is making headway and is a realistic way forward.“The Government has got to show that it is making some progress,” admits one leading Cabinet minister.No one in Downing Street is expecting a dramatic breakthrough at this summit, though.Theresa May told the Cabinet this week that Salzburg would be a “staging post” on the way to a deal.The British hope is that on Thursday, the EU will announce a special November meeting to discuss Brexit. That, combined with the October EU Council, should provide time for a deal to be done.But, in a sign of how the timetable could slip further, one Downing Street figure close to the negotiations has told influential Europeans that  a deal was done in December, the Government could still get it through parliament in time for Brexit day.Others in No10  are insistent that the withdrawal agreement needs to be done by November. What May needs to judge though is whether the EU is serious about engaging with her Chequers plan or not.Influential Cabinet ministers are worried that the EU will never formally kill off Chequers but will not ever really take it seriously. Then at the last, May will be left with only two options when it comes to  getting a withdrawal agreement.She would either have to leave Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU — a ision of the UK that May has repeatedly said is unacceptable.Or, sign the whole of the UK up to a customs union with the EU, which she has, again, said she does not want to do as it would deny Britain an independent trade policy.If she does not want to take either of these bad deals, she would be left with No Deal.The Government still hopes that the member states, who are accountable to their electorates for the consequences of no deal, will tell the Commission to be more flexible as the clock ticks down.  But Chequers, which was sold to the Cabinet on the basis it was “negotiable”, has not yet made the progress many in Government hoped it would.If this does not change soon, it will be time for Mrs May to change tack. At the same time, the Government must step up its preparations for le outside the EU.“Project After” is looking into how Britain can benefit from the freedoms it will have once it has left. But ministers tell me that it “needs more work”.This should be a priority for the Government. For Brexit does not guarantee this  country’s success or failure.  It is what we do after Brexit with our new-found  flexibility that will ­determine that.The Government must be ready to seize this moment.PHILIP HAMMOND has twice had to be slapped down by the Chief Whip in Cabinet this week.On Tuesday, he talked about how there would be a lot of “squealing” about universal credit. Julian Smith, the chief whip, then picked him up on his language.He said that talking about “squealing” doesn’t help. .Those sympathetic to Hammond say that he was talking specically about Labour when he used the word “squealing”. But it is another reminder of his political tin ear.Then on Thursday, Hammond raised the prospect of delaying Brexit day. After the ­legislative timetable for getting ready for “no deal” – which is tight –  had been outlined, Hammond pointed out that the Government has the power to put the Brexit date back.But doing this would be politically explosive.No one else present supported Hammond’s point and the chief whip shot it down, saying they would get all the legislation through in time.Theresa May then explicitly ruled out delaying Brexit day. Allies of Hammond say that he was only talking about an administrative pause of a few weeks.They argue that he only made the point after Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, raised concerns about there not being enough parliamentary time to get everything in place.But Any delay in exit day would cause a massive political crisis. No10 ­sources are adamant that there is “zero chance” of Brexit day not being March  29, 2019.But there is a major problem for the ­Government when the Chancellor, one of the three most senior figures in it, has such a political tin ear that he raises the prospect.This date would make things all too easy for the Government’s critics. It would be “The Zombie ­Budget”, “Hammond’s ­horror show”, “The bloodsucking Budget”.So, a Halloween Budget is out. No final date has yet been agreed for it. But the aim is for the Budget to take place before the special November EU Brexit summit.The Government does not want to risk the Budget ­getting caught up in the row over Theresa May’s ­negotiating position.So keen is the Government to keep these two events separate, there is even talk of breaking with tradition and possibly ­holding the Budget on a Monday .WHILE Boris Johnson has been keeping up a regular verbal barrage against Theresa May’s Chequers plan, she has not given it the hard sell.There has been no national tour, no fireside chat with the country or impassioned speech.But next week, Theresa May will try and make the case for her plan in an extended interview with Panorama. The BBC show was even allowed to film the start of Thursday’s “no-deal” Cabinet.Number 10’s view is that most voters don’t know what the Chequers plan means. They think that a lot of those who are hostile to it, particularly on the Tory side, are more aware of the row over it –  and particularly the resignations of Boris and David Davis – than the details of the plan.If the Prime Minister  though is going to persuade sceptical voters of the merit of her approach, she needs to admit that something has changed and explain why.It won’t work  she simply says she’s stuck rigidly to her red lines.Instead, she needs to ask voters to put themselves in her shoes, to under­stand why she has made the trade-offs that she has.Mrs May must treat the electorate like grown-ups.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In his very first disastrous Budget he tried, and failed, to raise National Insurance for self­-employed strivers. Has he learned? No.Now he intends to scrap a tax cut for White Van Man and a scheme helping hard-up Brits to start a business. He is plotting to hit drivers with the first fuel duty rise in years. And not content with taxing fizzy drinks, he targets the  CUPS.One sneaky grab after another, from people already struggling. What part of “just about managing” doesn’t he grasp?Mr Hammond is a glum, grey, blinkered bean-counter with no vision, political nous or clue how hard le is for the low-paid.

Older people have only dim memories of British Rail’s endless strikes, late trains, filthy carriages and lousy food. Younger generations weren’t born to experience it.Some private firms do run a great service. Others give the  system a bad name.Fares are too high and absurdly complex. Franchises are regional monopolies with no need to compete — all of them vulnerable to union blackmail.It is high time Transport Secretary Chris Grayling got to grips with it.THE Lib Dems won’t fool anyone with the “rebranding” Vince Cable fancies.The “New Liberal Democrats” would not be new, liberal or democratic.Reheated Blair ideas aren’t new.A party committed to state regulation of the Press and maintaining the EU’s protectionist trade policies isn’t liberal.And champions of democracy don’t fixate on overthrowing the biggest ­ballot box ­mandate in our history.Back to the blank slate, Vince.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The next it’s sugar. Then carbs. A few weeks later, sugar is back on the naughty step.It’s the same with alcohol. Until recently, a glass of wine a day kept heart attacks at bay. Last month, we learned that NO amount of alcohol is safe. Then this week our new goal, apparently, should be two teetotal days a week.It’s hard to keep up — and no wonder many people ignore all the reports. Who wants to be told what to do by a bunch of scientists who can’t make up their mind?But the latest news from Public Health England should give us all pause for thought, because British women now have some of the lowest le expectancies in Europe.Girls born in the UK today can expect to die three-and-a-half years earlier than girls in Spain, the country that comes out top in this report. The reasons? Rising levels of obesity and poor cancer survival rates.British women also fare badly when it comes to premature deaths — defined as before 75.Many are caused by cancer, heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, which are linked to smoking, alcohol and junk food.France, home of Michelin star chefs, is also way down on the list. And so is Italy.My supporting evidence is that I live with an Italian, who would be more likely to attend a funeral in a jester’s hat than eat a bag of crisps.Clearly, we all need to take a leaf out of the same book.The prevailing wisdom is that it’s more expensive to eat healthily. But that’s not true.A recent report from the Institute of Economic Affairs shows it’s possible to have your five-a-day for less than 30p — and a nutritious,  plain, diet can be bought for less than £1 a day.Meanwhile, the cheapest adult meal in McDonald’s is about £4.50, for which you could make a fresh vegetable curry for the whole family.So it’s not about money. Why, then, do us British women fare so badly?I wonder  we are so daunted by images of women airbrushed to perfection, in adverts and on social media, we feel we can’t compete. So we give up, eating what we like and not exercising.Because keeping really fit takes serious work.The latest insight into this is from movie star Mark Wahlberg who shared his daily schedule this week.He’s in bed by 7.30pm then up at 2.30am for the first of his two daily workouts. His fitness schedule only allows for two hours’ “work” a day — and thus it becomes clear his job is, in fact, his physique.Since most of us spend at least ten hours a day working and commuting, you can see why it’s often easier not to bother.But it’s not just our health that’s in peril. It’s also that of our children, for whom we are the primary role models.Not about vanity, but good healthI have evidence in the form of my best friend, who is a marathon-running exercise junkie — as is her daughter.I, on the other hand, although not proud of this fact, do no exercise — and my daughter doesn’t enjoy it as much as her friends.Getting fit and losing weight can feel impossible.But look at Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who this week announced that he has lost 7st and put his Type 2 diabetes in remission, which is pretty inspiring.So let’s choose to make this bad news story into a positive and use it as inspiration for change.Let’s aim for two booze-free days a week.And maybe ditch the biscuits for a bit and make some other small, sustainable changes that will leave us able to go for a brisk walk without fearing a heart attack.This is not about vanity, it’s about good health. Because the alternative is sobering.When it started off 18 years ago it was innovative and exciting TV. But now it’s degenerated into a hotbed of fame-hungry wannabes pitted against each other and behaving horribly as a result.Now it’s been axed. About time, too.I BELIEVE in people’s right to protest – of course – against political views they disagree with. But, Ian Bone, the protestor who assailed Jacob Rees-Mogg and his children on their own doorstep has crossed a line.“Your daddy is a horrible man,” Mr Bone told Mr Rees-Mogg’s bewildered-looking children, who will likely be traumatised by the incident – and will certainly not forget.MPs are already putting a lot on the line to serve their country. Many endure threats of violence or even death – and just look at what happened to Jo Cox.Yes, it’s fine to disagree with politicians and to protest. But taking it out on children and trying to make them feel bad about their father is bullying behaviour that is wholly unacceptable.Speaking to LBC afterwards, Mr Bone, who is 71, said that he saw no problem with involving children in his protest.But despite being happy to bring Mr Rees-Mogg’s offspring into the argument, he refused to speak about his own five children, and repeatedly refused to answer  he would have been happy for them to be treated in the same way.Talk about hypocritical.EVERYONE praised as progress the BBC’s “solution” to the inequality on comedy panel shows, which has been to ensure there is at least one woman on every show.But then we hear from Sandi Toksvig that their contributions are often edited out.The QI host told the Radio Times: “There are panel shows that struggle to get women on, and that’s because . . . in the edit they are often seen just laughing at the boys and not saying anything at all, even though I know for a fact in the recording they were clever.”Turns out that turning up and being funny isn’t quite enough,  you are a woman, to be given the same air time as men. How annoying.MY Woman of the Week award goes to Carol Vorderman who, at 57, is clearly in her absolute element and loving le.She looks healthy and oozes confidence, especially in these skin-tight jeans.She told ITV’s Lorraine this week she’s happy being single and is not looking for a “keeper” or another intense relationship.In fact, she said she “couldn’t think of anything worse”.How refreshing. And what a great role model she is for women in their fties and beyond.WATCHING the video of a homeless man being sprayed with paint in Middlesbrough made my blood boil.The poor man – who was found dead just days later in a cemetery – is filmed sat against a wall, covered in paint, as a man brags: “This is how we dealwith the beggars on the street.”This disregard for another human being’s dignity is obscene and the yob should be made to volunteer helping homeless people.Until he sees that dehumanising this man who had hit troubled times was the lowest of the low.DID you see Madonna’s daughter, 21-year old Lourdes hitting the runway for the Gypsy Sport Spring Summer 2019 showcase at New York Fashion Week?It’s so dispiriting, isn’t it, that the headline news about her appearance, which could have focused on so many dferent things – her incredible confidence, for one – was that . . . she hadn’t shaved her legs, top.I guess true equality will have been achieved when a woman’s hairy calves go unmentioned and are seen as neither here nor there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs. Wages are rising. Growth is strong.Now we see French companies such as Chanel stampeding to invest billions here.

I pulled myself back out from underneath it before it could run over me again.”Jack said his stomach appeared to be disfigured and deformed with his belly button pushed off to the left of his body.Vicky suffered a broken collarbone, fractured sternum and broken vertebrae.He could also see the truck’s tyre tread on his stomach, but as the pain kicked in he was unable to scream due to his punctured lung.A crowd gathered round and people told him stay still and focus on breathing until the ambulance arrived.Falling in and out of consciousness, Jack said: “My next clear memory is waking up in a hospital bed.“My stomach was extremely painful. I pulled back the covers and saw a huge scar running from under my nipple to my groin.”Jack now suffers with PTSD and cannot use the toilet properly as a result of his injuries.Samantha Williams, from law firm Slater and Gordon said: “Mr Moore has gone from being a fit and healthy young man with his le ahead of him to somebody who struggles to do the most basic activities without being in pain.“Along with the horric physical scars, he may never be able to erase the memory of the large vehicle driving over him.“He and his girlfriend were lying in an open space, clearly visible to everyone around them, yet the driver of this vehicle failed to see them.“It’s vital that lessons are learnt from this awful accident.”The truck driver was fined £195 and lost his job at Norse.A spokesperson for Norse said: “We referred this matter to our insurers shortly after the incident happened.“The driver concerned was dismissed and the HSE acknowledged robust steps had been taken by our company in light of the incident and has told us no further action is planned against us.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000344678672.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"coca cola talks marijuana wellness drinks","story":"The soft drink giant was in “serious talks” with Aurora Cannabis to create a line of recovery drinks, BNN Bloomberg reported.The drinks would be infused with CBD – cannabidiol – the non-psychoactive chemical found in the marijuana plant.They would act as a mild painkiller, and help reduce muscle inflammation and cramping.They would not give consumers the “buzz” many recreational weed smokers seek.One source close to the deal said the two companies were pretty advanced down the path” of doing a deal, the source told BNN.The move signals a signicant commercial sht in willingness to incorporate a drug which is rapidly become more accepted world-wide.The CBD market is ripe for tapping too, with estimates suggesting it could grow to £1.6billion by 2020.In 2015 the market for products infused with the chemical was only £153million.Kent Landers, a spokesman from Coca-Cola, said in a media statement that many in the beverage industry were closely watching the growth of non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient in al wellness beverages around the world.“The space is evolving quickly.

And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism. But we will avoid the same fate only  the state adopts a new approach on immigration, including more political honesty, tighter border controls and an emphasis on British values.That is not racist. As the public knows, it is a recipe for greater harmony.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maybe not. Regardless, it is to Mr Hancock’s credit that he is starting a grown-up conversation at last over future funding of health.For too long progress has been stymied by the Left using any change to the NHS as a political weapon.But the structure of a health service designed in 1948 now needs a radical rethink.It is time reality dawned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

some sunk deep in the permafrost soil - aim to extend research by Russian scientists who are already working closely with South Korean specialists hoping to restore extinct species. Yakutsk is capital of diamond-rich Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia,  where 80 per cent of finds of samples of Pleistocene and Holocene animals with preserved soft tissues have been made.The scheme of the new centre will be unveiled at the 4th Eastern Economic Forum hosted by Putin opening on 11 September in Vlaostok. It will “aim to study extinct animals from living cells - and to restore such creatures as the woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, cave lion and breeds of long-gone horses”, reported The Siberian Times.The cloning scientists are already using DNA from the ancient animals has been preserved in remains encased in frozen soil - or permafrost - for tens of thousands of years. The centre will be based at Russia’s Northern-Eastern Federal University  which is seeking further investment for the extraordinary project.   Expert Dr Lena Grigorieva - who drafted plans for the centre - said: “There is no such unique material anywhere else in the world.”But scientists would also explore ways of helping fight human diseases, she said. “We study not only Pleistocene animals - another line is the study of the history of settlement of the North-East of Russia,” she said.  Northern ethnic groups have a unique ancient genetic structure. “Such studies will help in the study of rare genetic diseases, their diagnosis, prevention.”The university has existing close cooperation with South Korean SOOAM Biotech Research Foundation, led by cloning expert Professor Hwang Woo-Suk.There are also links between Russian scientists and trailblazing Hard University geneticist Professor George Church who plans to inset woolly mammoth genes into an Asian elephant embryo by 2020.Prof Church has revealed to Sun Online how a cloning project was on the verge of being able to grow a baby mammoth in a lab.His team of leading Hard scientists have been using DNA recovered from a woolly mammoth found perfectly preserved in ice in Siberia after dying 42,000 years ago.By merging genes from the mammals with that of elephants their species may be resurrected.The team are set to publish in the coming weeks scientic papers laying out in detail their revolutionary technique in creating and implanting mammalian embryos.Speaking to exclusively to Sun Online, Prof Church said: “We have already revived dozens of genes and are testing them in elephant cells.“We are focusing on a reviving mammoth genes and making a mammoth/elephant hybrid and help them spread to vast wild, arctic climates.”Using a genetic engineering technique called CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing, his team of scientists can “cut and paste” strands of DNA into elephant stem cells with a precision not seen before, paving the way for a woolly mammoth embryo. Prof Church said he wants to then grow a hybrid woolly mammoth/elephant hybrid within an articial womb rather than using a female elephant as a surrogate mum. It is estimated this will take at least 22 months.The prof believes this will allow woolly mammoths herds to begin once more plodding about the arctic and while doing so save the world. Along with other measures, its hoped the woolly mammoths will create an environment which could stop Siberias permafrost melting and then releasing billions of tons of greenhouse gases.The doomsday scenario has been dubbed as the “methane bomb” because  it happened it would dramatically worsen climate change, melting the ice cap and flooding countries across the world.And there is clear evidence that this is already happening.Bubble like mounds have been popping up like a geological plague and some have already burst and spewed out toxic gas which damages the atmosphere.But the worst of this ticking time bomb has yet to happen. Much of the methane is still trapped underneath by the permafrost layer which is fast disappearing and threatens to release the gas at any moment. An area where this is starting to happen is the Yamal Peninsula. Shocking aerial footage has revealed thousands of methane-filled craters — which threatens to happen across Russia’s frozen far north.Ironically, melting ice here revealed preserved woolly mammoths that are now being used in the cloning attempts.And  the huge furry mammoths/elephant hybrids were to be brought into being, Prof Church said they could repopulate these freezing wastelands and help lock in the lethal fumes. He said: “Cold-resistant elephants would flatten the insulating snow and supporting trees in winter and favour the highly heat reflective grass in summer.Should Prof Church and his Hard uni team successfully clone woolly mammoths they would be taken to an extraordinary Ice Age safari park currently being developed by Russian scientists.Called the Pleistocene Park, the 20,000 hectare zone in the furthest stretches of remote Siberia has been created in a bid to recreate an Ice-Age ecosystem. Boffins believe grazing woolly mammoths would also compact the snow in the winter and grass in the summer all of which lowers the permafrost temperature.In a previous interview, park director and scientist Nikita Zimov told Sun Online: By the time mammoths will be cloned,  theyre cloned and brought to the park, we will have a system.Theyll eat shrubs, break down shrubs. Theyll trample down the grass, eat the grass. The park is to show animals can transform the vegetation.If the park, which is already populated with bison, horses, moose, reindeer and muskox, is successful it will be expanded across the north in areas where there is a risk of mass methane release."},{"url":null,"title":"brits take to twitter to share windy memes as storm helene batters uk with 70mph gales","story":"Forecasters issued severe weather warnings  – but online wind-up merchants were quick to joke about the conditions.The storm obviously passed some by and they shared photos of single deck chairs and wheelie bins knocked over to poke fun at the predictions.Others who clearly felt the brunt of the gusts tweeted pictures of a businessman holding onto iron railings for dear le and a cat clinging to a tree.But while tweeters made light of Storm Helene, the Met Office said Britain is set for further wind and rain.Storm Ali will bring 85mph gales and an amber weather warning when it hits tomorrow. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004310764844.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"left wing labour staff in bolshevik plot to keep control of the party if jeremy corbyn suddenly steps down","story":"Emergency plans are reportedly being drawn up to severely restrict the powers of his deputy Tom Watson  he becomes “acting leader”.All decisions would therefore have to go through the hard-left National Executive Committee as part of attempts to stop moderates taking back control of the direction of Labour.There are fears that in the months-long period while a leadership contest is arranged and run, opponents of the Corbyn project will seek to roll back the changes he has made.The HuffPost said a proposed rule change drafted by senior allies of the current leader would add a brand new clause to the Labour constitution.It would effectively put the NEC in charge rather than Mr Watson, by setting out the “acting leader’s scope for action, powers, requirement for approval of actions by the NEC and any other qualications on the scope of the role”.The wording of the change, which is buried in the papers being discussed at today’s meeting of the executive and has no guarantee of being passes, has sparked anger among MPs.One told HuffPost: “This looks like they’re trying to turn the NEC into the Politburo with greater power than the acting leader.“But it also looks like someone is trying to lay the ground for the departure of Jeremy at some point over the next year.”And a senior figure added: “It’s an unenforceable act of paranoid Bolshevism.”But Mr Corbyn is currently showing no signs of wanting to step down, and a Labour source said it was “complete and utter rubbish” to suggest he was intending to resign.Mr Watson, who was elected by the member with his own mandate back in 2015, and has repeatedly found himself at odds with his boss.He was involved in the failed 2016 coup against the Labour leader, and despite being more loyal since the 2017 election he has been critical in recent weeks over Mr Corbyn’s handling of the anti-Semitism crisis.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was constantly getting booted and punched, booted and punched.“It was mainly Ian, but Michael would join in, and  he stopped, Jean would join in.”Some of the strongest evidence of the women’s ordeals was unwittingly provided by Hitt herself – because she had a phone app that recorded all conversations.In one recording, Hitt discussed Miss Jenkins being “locked in,” and complained about her speaking to a social worker through the letterbox.Describing another conversation, Mr Russell said: “They’re taking a ghoulish delight in the level of abuse their two prisoners can stand.”The victims were finally saved when police received an anonymous tip-off and they raided the two flats.Miss Jenkins had suffered extensive facial injuries, a fractured breastbone and a broken finger.Her mum had two fractures to her back, two broken ribs, and bruises all over her face.Ms Dagley told the court: “They would lock me up every night, and then let me out in the morning to help Jean in her flat, and then lock me up again at night.“It was all of them.”Prosecutors said Jean Kelly was the ringleader who directed the detention and forced labour of both victims.Mr Russell said: “She boasted cruelly in phone calls to her daughter about the injuries inflicted on both women. She appeared to glory in their suffering.The defendants will be sentenced next month."},{"url":null,"title":"female big game hunter slammed by celebs","story":"The unveried image of the woman, only referred to as Britany L, has been shared to US based Safari Club International and has since sparked world-wide outrage.But it turned out it is perhaps no surprise the hunter was posing with the dead animal.For animal experts believe the slaughtered leopard was likely the ninth largest ever hunted. The backlash was first sparked by South African artist Sue Dickinson, who dubbed Britany L a “cretin” in a Facebook post on September 10.Before long this attracted 42000 comments and 217,000 shares.And by Friday, it was shared by anti-ivory poaching group Knot On My Planet founder David Bonnouvrier who asked his followers to find this b****.Celebrities like Naomi Campbell and Dutch supermodel Doutzen Kroes also expressed horror.Ms Kroes wrote: “How can you find pride and pleasure in killing a beautul animal like this large male Leopard.The woman in the picture should be ashamed of herself! I find this disgusting and I’m so upset, sad and angry that this still happens!!While Campbell tweeted: A very large male Leopard recently killed by Britani L. Member of the safari club international based in Tucson AZ call them and give them a piece of your mind.Wealthy hunters, mostly from America, pay up to £60,000 to track and kill a fully grown elephant. Other animals popular with trophy hunters are lions, leopards, rhinos, buffalos and deer.Every hunter must purchase a license that allows them to hunt. A license for an elephant, for example, is more costly than that for a lion.However, some nations completely outlaw the practice. Botswana, for example, argues that it can become an exclusive tourist destination that brings in more cash than it loses from the hunting ban.The outrage comes after numerous female big game hunters have being posting their kills online. In July an American big game hunter caused outrage for slaughtering a rare black giraffe during a South Africa hunting trip.Tess Thompson Talley posted photos of herself posing with the slain creature online about a year ago.Meanwhile another hunter reportedly took her own le after being targeted by animal terroristsLast year hunter Melania Capitan claimed she had been targeted by trolls for years because of her hunting, with vile comments including that she should receive a beating.Former American beauty queen and passionate hunter Olivia Nalos Opre revealed she received over 1000 hate messages in an HOUR when Cecil the lion was shot and once had a bounty of £40,000 on her head."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/09/2048x1152/skynews-mini-plant-bmw-production-line_4425130.jpg?20180918131019 ","title":"bmw to shut mini factory for a month after brexit day sky sources","story":"The development shows one of Europe\u0027s most successful and influential companies revealing how disruptive it expects no deal to be, and its lack of faith in a deal being reached.Workers have been told that the annual summer maintenance shutdown will have to be moved to April, as the company is obliged to take action against its fears of a shutdown of the cross-channel supplies required to make its cars.BMW and the rest of the car industry have long warned the government, both privately and in public, of the Brexit threat, and in particular the no deal threat to its \"just in time\" supply chains.

The proposal would restrict the powers of deputy leader Tom Watson in the event that the Labour leader steps down unexpectedly, according to HuffPost . Under current rules, Watson would become acting leader  Corbyn was incapacitated or quit without warning, until a leadership election can be called. The change would effectively put Labour’s ruling body, the National Executive Committee  in charge of the acting leader, and give them approval over his or her powers.  It says the NEC should have the power to set out the “scope for action, powers, requirement for approval of actions by the NEC and any other qualications on the scope of the role.” And the amendment introduces the new reform “immediately”, without being ratied by this year’s party conference. It includes a ‘sunset clause’ puts it in place pending a more permanent solution being approved at the 2019 party conference. Corbyn has repeatedly insisted he plans to lead Labour into the next election, and there\u0027s no indication he is planning to step down. One MP told HuffPost : “This looks like they’re trying to turn the NEC into the Politburo with greater power than the acting leader.  It comes as the NEC is braced for a showdown over rewriting the party rulebook to give members more of a say. The trade unions and Momentum group are set to clash over several planned changes including to how the party selects its leader. But last minute changes by general secretary Jennie Formby mean the group can sidestep the bitter row over mandatory reselections for MPs which has been rumbling within the party for the last few months. Party members and trade unions are set to be handed new powers in the reselection of sitting MPs under a compromise plan aimed at ‘opening up’ contests for Westminster seats but which falls short of mandatory reselections. Reports also suggest unions could be given a stronger role in the leadership election nominations.

She was there on a dare: to steal a five-cent notebook, the initiation rite for joining a girls\u0027 club at her elementary school. Sally, just a month shy of her eleventh birthday, was desperate to join that clique. She was lonely, confiding her troubles in her school teacher. Her father had committed suicide when she was six. Her mother, Ella, struggled to find and keep work as a seamstress. Her older sister, Susan, was due to give birth to her first child later that summer, which would make Sally an aunt. Then a hand tugged on her arm.  A middle-aged man, positively ancient to young Sally, announced he was an FBI agent, and that Sally was under arrest. And  she didn\u0027t do as he said, she would be packed off to reform school. Sally understood how terrible a fate this would be. The man said he would let her go this time, but he could come back and find her, without any warning. Three months later, in June 1948, that man found Sally again as she walked home from school. He threatened her again, upping the ante: Sally had to tell her mother that he was the father of school friends, promising a week\u0027s worth of vacation on the Jersey Shore. Sally went home and told her mother the concocted story. Ella believed it. On June 14, Ella took Sally to the Camden bus station, kissed her goodbye, and saw her go away on a bus, sitting next to a man she\u0027d never seen before. That man wasn\u0027t an FBI agent. Sally Horner was never under arrest. And the man, who called himself many names but was generally known as Frank La Salle, a career criminal only months removed from a prison term for the statutory rape of five girls between the ages of 12 and 14.  What was supposed to be a vacation transformed into a cross country nightmare that lasted twenty-one months. It took Sally from Camden to Atlantic City, to Baltimore, to Dallas, and then to San Jose, Calornia, where she was rescued – with the help of a concerned neighbour with secrets of her own – in March 1950. But Sally hardly had a chance to grow up, to recover fully from her rescue. Only two and a half years later, she would die in a tragic car accident at the age of 15. News of that car accident spread far and wide.  Sally\u0027s initial rescue was a national media sensation, even covered as far as Australia and New Zealand. But her death reached one vital inidual: the novelist Vladimir Nabokov. He read of it in the New York Times, copied the information down on a notecard  and, from the summer of 1952 through the end of 1953, wrote the rest of the novel that had so vexed him for the previous five years. That novel became Lolita, its account of a middle-aged man\u0027s obsessive, illicit, and illegal desire for a twelve-year-old girl still controversial more than sixty years after publication in 1955. And Sally Horner\u0027s plight, and its inspiration for Lolita, hid in plain sight, like a neon sign read to flash under the right circumstances, thanks to a parenthetical aside by the novel\u0027s unreliable narrator, Humbert Humbert, who wonders: “Had I done to Dolly, perhaps, what Frank Lasalle [sic], a fty-year-old mechanic, did to eleven-year-old Sally Horner in 1948?”  Research Several years ago, I stumbled upon what happened to Sally Horner while looking for my next crime story idea. Sally\u0027 s kidnapping, terrying odyssey, and dramatic rescue caught my attention with particular urgency. Here was a young girl, victimised over a twenty-one month odyssey from taking her from Camden, New Jersey to Atlantic City, then on to Baltimore, Dallas, and Calornia, by an opportunistic child molester named Frank La Salle. Here was a girl who figured out a way to survive away from home against her will, who acted in ways that baffled her friends and relatives at the time. Here was a girl who survived her ordeal when so many others, snatched away from their lives, do not. Then for her to die in a car accident just two and a half years after her rescue, her story then subsumed by a novel, one of the most iconic, important works of the 20th century, immortalised by that single parenthetical hardly anyone noticed. No wonder Sally Horner got under my skin in a way that few stories ever have before or since. No wonder I spent months chasing down court documents, talking to family members, visiting some of the places she had lived – and some of the places where her abductor, La Salle, took her. And even after a Canadian online magazine published my article about Sally\u0027s le and its connections to Lolita in the fall of 2014, I knew I wasn\u0027t finished with Sally. Or, more accurately, she was not finished with me. What drove me then and galls me now is that Sally’s abduction defined her entire short le. She never had a chance to grow up, pursue a career, marry, have children, grow old, be happy. She never got to build on the fierce intelligence so evident to her best friend that, nearly seven decades later, she spoke to me of Sally not as a peer, but as a mentor. After Sally died, her family rarely mentioned her or what had happened. They didn’t speak of her with awe, or pity, or scorn. She was only an absence. For decades Sally’s claim to immortality was as an incidental reference in Lolita, one of the many utterances by the predatory, middle-aged narrator, Humbert Humbert, that allows him to control the narrative, and of course, to control twelve-year-old Dolores Haze. Like Lolita, Sally Horner was no “little deadly demon among the wholesome children.” Both girls, fictional and real, were wholesome children.  Contrary to Humbert Humbert’s assertions, Sally, like Lolita, was no seductress, “unconscious herself of her fantastic power.” The fantastic power both girls possessed was the capacity to haunt. Over the four and a half years I spent working on The Real Lolita, I talked with a great many people about Lolita. For some it was their favourite novel, or one of their favourites. Others had never read the book but ventured an opinion nonetheless. Some loathed it, or the idea of it. No one was neutral. Considering the subject matter, this was not a surprise. Not a single person, when I quoted the passage about Sally Horner, remembered it. I can’t say Nabokov designed Lolita to hide Sally Horner from the reader. But given that the narrative moves so swtly, perhaps an homage to the highways Humbert and Dolores traverse over many thousands of miles in their cross-country odyssey, it’s easy to miss a lot as you go. Even casual readers of Lolita, who number in the tens of millions, plus the many more millions with some awareness of the novel, the two film versions, or its place in the culture these past six decades, should pay attention to the story of Sally Horner. Because it is the story of so many girls and women, not just in America and the UK, but everywhere.

The royal gang will be out in force on October 12 for the celebration, which will be held in the same church as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding in May. Despite being ninth in line to the throne and carrying out no official royal duties, Eugenie\u0027s wedding is actually going to bigger than her cousin\u0027s. Not content with just one day of celebrations, the happy couple\u0027s guests will enjoy a two-day party including a formal reception and a \u0027festival and funfair themed\u0027 party the following day. But weddings don\u0027t come cheap - especially when you\u0027re a member of the royal family and your guest list includes some of the most famous faces in the world.  They\u0027ve also decided to make their wedding plastic-free, which will be costly, and they\u0027re planning to take a carriage ride around Windsor to wave to well-wishers which will come with a hefty security bill. Dad Prince Andrew was said to have demanded a glitzy event, similar to Harry and Meghan\u0027s, for his younger daughter with Sarah Ferguson. A royal source said: The Duke of York has insisted his daughter\u0027s wedding must be a huge occasion to be remembered and wants everyone to get on board to celebrate the happy couple. So how much is all this going to cost? And more importantly, where is the money coming from? How much is the wedding going to cost? Wedding planning company Bridebook has calculated roughly how much the royal wedding is going to cost, including everything from the venue, the food, the dress and the entertainment.  According to their estimations, the total bill will come in at around \u0026pound2,820,620 . This is how they\u0027ve broken it down: The venue - \u0026pound85,000 to \u0026pound300,000 Eugenie and Jack\u0027s ceremony will be held at St George\u0027s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The Queen will then host an afternoon reception in the castle, before guests head back to Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson\u0027s home Royal Lodge. This means they won\u0027t have to pay for the venues themselves, however having a wedding at home can be equally pricey.  The experts at Bridebook believe the couple are likely to have a marquee to keep the guests warm on the October evening. They\u0027ll also need a fully-equipped catering tent and potentially more for other behind-the-scenes bits. However they could also pick a glass style marquee, which is what Pippa Middleton had for her wedding, which could cost \u0026pound300,000. The dress - \u0026pound230,000 There\u0027s a lot of speculation around who Eugenie will pick to create her wedding dress, and all we know so far is that it will be a British designer . She\u0027s known for her bold and quirky style, so people are excited to see what she looks like on the day.  Bridesbook believe she will spend about \u0026pound230,000 on the dress. Bridesmaid dresses - \u0026pound5,000 We\u0027re yet to receive a full list of Eugenie and Jack\u0027s bridal party, but it\u0027s likely that Princess Beatrice will be the maid-of-honour. The sisters are incredibly close, so it would be surprising  the princess doesn\u0027t have her big sister by her side on her special day. Royal weddings are known for their young bridesmaids and pageboys, so we might get to see Prince George and Princess Charlotte in the role again.  Whoever they pick, the couple will need to splash out for bridesmaids dresses and suits for their nearest and dearest Groom\u0027s outfit - \u0026pound6,050 While it\u0027s nowhere near as exciting as the bride\u0027s dress, we\u0027re sure Jack will look very smart for his big day. The wedding invite states the dress code is morning suits, which suggests he will be wearing the same. We doubt he\u0027ll be wearing off the rack, so a bespoke tailcoat, waistcoat and trousers normally cost around\u0026pound4,400.  On top of that you\u0027ve got new shoes, which could be around \u0026pound900, and of course the second outfit for the evening celebrations which could be an extra \u0026pound3,000. Booze - \u0026pound84,500 This is one area we assume Jack has taken the lead on, as he\u0027s got a lot of experience with bars and nightclubs. He\u0027s the UK Ambassador for George Clooney\u0027s tequila company and he used to own his own nightclub. Meghan and Harry had their own cocktails at their wedding - called When Harry met Meghan - so there\u0027s a chance Eugenie and Jack might do the same. There\u0027s also likely to be a lot of champagne and of course a lot of tequila! Flowers - \u0026pound100,000 Wedding flowers are an important part of the wedding, and by picking an autumn wedding Eugenie will have lots of beautul flowers to choose from.  Bridebook believes the cost of the bouquets and decorating the church and reception venues will cost around \u0026pound100,000. Photographer and wedding video - \u0026pound17,000 Even though they will have the world\u0027s media photographing all the public parts of their special day, Eugenie and Jack will probably also have their own snapper there. If they want a A-list photographer, like Meghan and Harry, they\u0027ll have to splash out a lot of cash. There\u0027s also a chance they\u0027ll have a wedding video to capture all those special moments. Cake - \u0026pound5,600 As anyone who has planned a wedding before will know, the second you put the word \u0027wedding\u0027 in front of cake you automatically have to add a few zeros.  Stationary - \u0026pound30,000 We\u0027re yet to officially see the wedding invitations, but pictures of them have been leaked online. Entertainment - \u0026pound25,000 to \u0026pound55,000 This is probably going to be a large chunk of their wedding cost, and it\u0027s likely that there will be lots of performers and other fun things for the guests to enjoy. Toilets - \u0026pound16,000 This isn\u0027t something many brides have to think about when planning their big day, but as the second part of their celebration will be outdoors they might have to sort out some extra loos. We suspect they\u0027ll opt for something a bit fancier than festival-style portaloos for their big day, but pretty much whatever they pick will come with a cost. According to the experts, this could cost them an extra \u0026pound16,000.  Who will be paying? The wedding parties will be paid for by the Queen and Princess Eugenie\u0027s parents Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson. However the hefty security bill, including the costs to keep them safe during the open-top carriage procession, will be picked up by the taxpayer. The news caused outrage with people up and down the country , with many claiming we should not be contributing to a big party for a non-working member of the royal family, especially when they\u0027ve got the cash to fund it themselves. Emma Dent Coad, Labour MP for Kensington – where Eugenie and Jack live in Kensington Palace at a vastly reduced rent – slammed their plans.

She is a woman not only out of her depth, has not only floundered for more than a decade, but has no idea where she\u0027s gone wrong. It\u0027s hard to see her without thinking of a fly batting itself against a window until it expires, able to see the fresh air but unable to find it. If she reads this - which she might, because she defines herself only by what others think of her - she\u0027ll assume I\u0027m a Left-wing liberal about to rail against her Right-wing freedom of speech. No, Katie. Someone who knows more than you is going to explain how the hatred has suffocated you. We both have epilepsy - mine very mild, hers very severe. The condition strikes in her sleep, led to her being expelled from Sandhurst, to break vertebrae and frequently dislocate her shoulders. She recently had brain surgery that ended the seizures but left her with a hole in her skull and needing to re-learn how to climb stairs. She blames the medication she has needed since young for the fact her oldest daughter is autistic and her youngest was born with a deformed hip that required many surgeries to correct. Those would be enough disability for most people to deal with. But Katie has an extra one - a mistaken belief that she\u0027s a journalist.  Let\u0027s not be precious about the Street of Shame. It is a trade, not a profession, and the only qualication necessary is a level of enthusiasm bordering on mental illness. But somewhere along the line most journalists get training. They get it from a practical degree, a vocational course, or at worst from paying attention to people who\u0027re doing it already. Katie became a journalist because first she became a media star, and she managed THAT with what she called being outspoken and everyone else called being a right cow. On The Apprentice in 2006 she hogged the camera by making amusingly-nasty remarks about maternity leave, fat people, and fellow contestants. She resigned at the end of the penultimate show citing childcare concerns, which others mocked because she had known what she was getting into. But it\u0027s perhaps worth noting both that her concerns were for two disabled daughters, and also that she was mocked mainly because she\u0027d been so happy to mock others.  Katie sold her story for six-figure sums, had celebrity spats, and was pictured in flagrante in a field with someone else\u0027s husband. She got a regular column in her local paper the Exeter Express \u0026amp Echo , but it ended after an online poll found 84% of the readers wanted her fired. It was a hint she did not take. She was invited onto TV as a guarantee of ratings. Three years ago Buzzfeed reported a former staffer at This Morning said she was always willing to cause controversy from the word go. Such programmes involve a chat with a producer in advance, and Katie would immediately come up with a firm line on something, and then wheeled on-air to spout it with little thought from either her or producers about where it would end. So in 2013 when she told Philip and Holly she wouldn\u0027t let her children play with someone called Tyler or Chardonnay or named after geography, it was pointed out one of her children was called India and the clip went viral.  Katie learned to make money by being rude and unapologetic, and the media learned to shore up their audience figures with a wingnut. Inevitably, she was offered a national newspaper column, a place in the Big Brother house, and more opprobrium as the hate multiplied. In 2015 she used her column to denounce migrants as cockroaches, and it quietly disappeared before she popped up at another website which racked up \u0026pound150,000 damages plus costs for her groundless claim that a pair of Muslim brothers banned from travelling to Disneyland were linked to al Qaeda. She met holocaust deniers, tweeted about being with crew of a Save the Children ship she didn\u0027t board, and had repeated applications to join UKIP rejected. She made a habit out of getting it wrong. She moved on to LBC, left after calling for a final solution to Islamic terror, was questioned but not charged over alleged hate crimes, and more recently staged a picture with children at a school without their parents\u0027 or teachers\u0027 permission, a gross breach of journalistic ethics. She has her own website and, one hopes, has invested in some defamation legal insurance. Now she\u0027s been sued over a defamatory tweet, lost her home, and had to enter an agreement with her creditors. All of it is due to the simple fact that she attempted to be a journalist without any of the necessary skills.  If Katie had experience of working in the media before she became its favourite monster, she\u0027d have known that what you don\u0027t say is just as important as what you do. By all means say you\u0027re snobby about the name Charmaine, but it might be an idea to know Shakespeare was happy to use it for one of his characters. If you make a habit of racking up legal bills for your employer, be careful with what you publish on social media. If you are caught lying, stop doing it. Steer clear of people with swastikas in their Twitter handles and  you don\u0027t know what defamation is, look it up. But more than anything else the lesson that Katie needed to learn was this: that becoming a hate figure is a viable but short media career. She chose a path that was an ever-decreasing spiral of bile, and it was only ever going to lead her into peril. I\u0027m not sure she knows how she got there. She started out as entertainment, and ended up with the twin Pyrrhic victories of being praised by Donald Trump and winning an IPSO ruling against the Daily Mirror about the fact she was not detained for taking ketamine in South Africa, but for spreading racial hatred. Now she\u0027s broke and the only people still paying attention are creditors and knicker-snfing Nazis.  Katie was not a journalist but a controversialist - built and brought down by her ignorance of how journalism works. Her name is flung at others who make a much better fist of it, along with accusations they all want to be like her. Nothing could be further from the truth - journalists, above all things, want to be right. Katie was just a story, and it\u0027s a sad indictment of the media that it relied for attention on a sick woman spouting proto-fascist lies. But the principal blame is on Katie herself. She had enough clues, from as early as her first interview after leaving The Apprentice when Nick Hewer said her new brand had made you famous, but it\u0027s made you loathed. And where\u0027s it going to take you now? She never seems to have asked where it would lead. Even with training, she would never have made much of a journo. She has a thick skin and bloody-mindedness, but seems to lack empathy, accuracy, self-doubt or persuasiveness. She is a curiosity, but doesn\u0027t have any. The first rule of journalism is \u0027never become the story\u0027. Not just because it\u0027s professionally embarrassing, but because all copy finishes the same way - with the word \u0027ends\u0027. * Fleet Street Fox\u0027s new book, A Bluffer\u0027s Guide To Journalism, is published in March.

John Phoenix, 30, of Leigh, was sentenced at Bolton Crown Court last week, after pleading guilty to rape and being found guilty of child abduction at an earlier hearing. In September 2017, a 12-year-old girl was reported missing from her home in Leigh. Police traced the girl to Phoenix’s address two days later and established that he had been messaging the victim on social media for a number of weeks. The night she went missing Phoenix took the girl to a nightclub in Leigh where he plied her with alcohol and kissed her before he took her back to his home. She woke up 14 hours later. Police rescued the victim from Phoenix\u0027s flat in Leigh, Greater Manchester following a search after her mother reported her missing on the night she was picked up by the cab. Phoenix was sentenced to 14 years in prison for the rape, and five years in prison for child abduction but the sentences will run concurrently. His girlfriend Stacey Westwood, 29, admitted sexual assault and was given four months jail suspended for two years. She was also ordered to sign the Sex Offender Register for seven years.  In a statement, the girl\u0027s mother said: \u0027\u0027This is every parent’s worst nightmare and I feel like I have failed in my parental duties. I felt so angry when he said that he thought she was 17. I am so worried about her, I have even contemplated sleeping by the front door just in case she tries to leave again. “She is so precious to me and I don’t want to hear how she blames herself for what happened and how she wants to die. When I found out what the female did to my daughter as well, I felt sick. I found it hard to comprehend.” Phoenix\u0027s victim has reportedly tried to hang herself following her ordeal. The girl said: “What happened with John Phoenix will change me forever I thought he was a friend. Finding out the science results, I couldn’t believe it and I was so upset. I will not refer to it as sex, I will refer to it as the mean thing because it was a mean thing to do. “I was so upset with myself because I didn’t think an adult of John’s age would ever do anything like that to a 12 year old. “If I don’t really know what John wanted then how will I be able to judge anybody else in the future. I feel like I will be in the dark.”  Prosecuting, Barbara Webster, said: “He ordered a taxi from her house which then took her to his house. She arrived at his house that evening and Stacey Westwood answered the door. He got changed and they went to [a club]. “Alcoholic drinks were then bought by him and Stacey Westwood and given to the victim. They left the club around 3am and at this point the victim was very drunk. They went home and went to sleep. She woke at around 5pm and said that her vagina felt sore. “He showed her a picture of her on social media that said she was a missing 12 year old. He said ‘is that you?’ and she said ‘yes.’ “She stayed with him and they went to [the club] again but then went home and did some jagerbombs. “On Saturday September 23, he went out with a friend and she stayed at his apartment and watched TV. He came home at around 4am and then later that morning the police came around and found her at his house. In mitigation defence lawyer Paul Treble, said: “The defence’s case is that he thought that she was over 16. She told a lady that she was over 16 and the defendant thought that she was over 16.

Sophie Hinchclfe , known as Mrs Hinch , has become an online sensation after filming herself cleaning her immaculate Essex home, which she shares with husband Jamie and pet pooch Henry.  Her spotless kitchen and lounge have become the envy of many and her amusing commentary as she cleans is now inspiring others to don their rubber gloves and whack out their feather dusters. People are so in awe of her vivacious personality and catchphrases - including \u0027All the best\u0027 - she has won a legion of fans. With 468,000 follower and counting, they call themselves Hinch Army.   Sophie even appeared on This Morning today, alongside presenters Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, sparking even more of a cleaning frenzy.  The 28-year-old, who got married last month, admits she cleans for at least 30 minutes a day. Her pride and joy is her shiny, streak-free kitchen sink. She stores a lot of her products in a wardrobe in her garage which she calls her \u0027Narnia\u0027. And she swears by certain items which she buys from shops such as Wilko, B\u0026ampM and Poundstretcher. Some of these stores have now even dedicated shelf space with the sign \u0027Hinch Army\u0027 for shoppers, The hairdresser has also given all her favourite cleaning items unusual nicknames.  The one item fans will be most familiar with is \u0027Minkeh\u0027 which has become like gold dust and is sold out everywhere, thanks to Sophie. She uses Minkeh , Dave , Buddy , Pinkeh  and Vera . Her other top products are Flash with Febreze Bathroom Spray, CIF Stainless Steel Spray, Toilet Duck 4in1 Liquid Cleaner in the scent Fresh Pine, 1001 Carpet Spray and Zoflora. Most of the products cost \u0026pound1 but because of Sophie\u0027s recommendations, many are selling out, or going on sale online at massively inflated prices due to the high demand.  Sophie created her profile @MrsHinchHome_X_ in March.  However, it has only been since July that the number of followers has sky rocketed since she started sharing her cleaning routines.  It just spiralled and I couldn\u0027t be more grateful, she said. It started off as around 200 or 500 [followers] a month and now it\u0027s as many as 35,000 a day. It\u0027s in the last four to six weeks that it has gone viral. I\u0027ve got followers from Ireland, the US and Australia and they are all amazing. Sophie also admits cleaning has helped her cope with her anxiety. I\u0027m a worrier, she added. For me, to keep my mind off of what was worrying me would be to clean and organise something and love the end result.  It took my mind off worrying. It helps me control my panic attacks too. Since I\u0027ve started the account others have messaged me saying I\u0027ve changed their lives and helped them with their mental health which to me is simply amazing. I get thousands of messages each day like this. Here are a selection of tips from her ever-growing Instagram page. 1. What to do with plugs Pour some soda crystals down each plug then use white vinegar spray then use neat disinfectant  while boiling the kettle. Wash it all away with boiling water. 2.How to get sinks sparkling Use disinfectant spray, add a little bit of water, then wipe down excess before using stainless steel cleaner  before using a cloth to finish it off.  3.Removing food mess from wooden floors Spray degreaser over the affected area and use an electric toothbrush to remove it before using a cloth. 4.Keeping your hob stain free Use a cloth and cleaning paste, such as The Pink Stuff. After a few minutes rinse with another wet cloth and repeat.  5.Cleaning your washing machine Slide out the drawer and use a bathroom spray, before spraying limescale remover into the gap where the drawer was.

Midwives want women to be given targets about how much weight they can gain during pregnancy. Weigh-ins for expectant mothers were phased out in the 1990s as it was believed it caused undue stress to women. However, the Royal College of Midwives now wants limits on weight-gain put in place as new research shows that excess weight gain could lead to unhealthy children.   The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence  are considering a target of 2st 7lb  for women of a normal weight and 1st 6lb  for those who are obese, reports The Times .  Current guidelines advise women to eat healthily during pregnancy and to only eat 200 more calories per day during the second and third trimesters. One in five women in Britain are now classed as obese, sparking calls to reintroduce weigh-ins for mums-to-be. According to the World Health organisation, 30 per cent of adult women in England are overweight and 27 per cent are obese. Now a new study has found that seven-year-old children whose mothers gained too much or too little weight during pregnancy tended to have high blood pressure and poor blood sugar control.  Children whose mums had gained too much weight were found to be larger and had higher body fat. Mandy Forrester, head of quality and standards at the Royal College of Midwives, said: “During pregnancy, women are very receptive to messages and advice about weight management issues and midwives can have a real impact on improving women’s health and wellbeing. We are calling for clear guidance on weight management.” Nice are considering whether to introduce weight-gain guidelines which are used in the US. The Institute of Medicine says women with a normal BMI should gain between 1st 1lb and 2st 7lb , underweight women 2st and 2st 2lb , overweight women between 1st 1lb and 1st 11lb  and obese women between 11lb and 1st 6lb .  While midwives often refer to this guidance, which was introduced in the States in 2009, Ms Forrester says midwives often don\u0027t have access to scales. The new study was published in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. It was carried out at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and involved 905 mother-child pairs. Wing Hung Tam and Ronald Ma, the professors who led the study, said it was important that women gained neither too much nor too little weight.

Fierce winds and heavy rain will persist through the afternoon and, in some places, into the evening. A yellow warning for wind is due to expire at 10pm on Wednesday, while the more severe amber warning is set to end at 5pm. Ali is arriving one day after the remnants of former hurricane Helene slammed some areas with 80mph winds and heavy rain. What are the biggest threats? Ali\u0027s winds will gust to 80mph and up to 70mm of rain is possible in parts of western and central Scotland. According to the Met Office, people in the warning areas should prepare themselves for:  Flying debris is likely and could lead to injuries or danger to le. Road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected, with longer journey times and cancellations possible. Some damage to buildings is possible, such as tiles blown from roofs. Falling trees or branches. Power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage. Some roads and bridges may close.   The Met Office said in its amber warning: Storm Ali will bring a spell of very strong winds to Northern Ireland from early on Wednesday morning, before these strong winds spread to far northwest England and central and southern Scotland by late morning. Strong winds will be accompanied by heavy squally showers. Some areas, especially high ground and coastal regions, including within the Central Belt, could see gusts of 80 mph at times. Winds will ease from the west through the afternoon. Ali is the first named storm of the 2018-19 season. The Met Office and Ireland\u0027s national weather service have decided to name major storms to bring greater urgency to warnings that encourage people to take precautions. Bronagh, Callum and Deirdre are among the other names to be used this season.  Why was an amber warning issued? The Met Office uses three colours to warn of dangerous storms - yellow, amber and, for the most severe, red. An amber warning is issued when severe weather could put lives in danger and disrupt travel. The Met Office said: You should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property. You may want to consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact.

So  you\u0027re planning on hitting the road any time soon, read on and follow these bits of advice to avoid any motoring mishaps... Check your tyre pressure  Before any long journey you need to check your tyre pressure. Safety and fuel economy both benefit from making sure your tyres are properly inflated  If you\u0027re putting off checking then it might be because you don\u0027t have the best equipment to inflate your tyres.   The Halfords Rapid Digital Tyre Inflator , \u0026pound39.99, makes le easier by inflating your tyres automatically.  Just set in the manufacturer recommended pressure  and let it fill the tyres automatically.

It can get your tyres to the perfect pressure in around three minutes too, saving you from having to queue at the petrol station en route. Don\u0027t set off without a sat nav  A lot of people rely on their phones for navigation these days, but you\u0027d be surprised at the added features a good sat nav can offer - as well as being much safer. . Warnings about roads are particularly useful  you\u0027re not familiar with a route - it can tell you when a sharp bend is approaching or  you\u0027re near a school.  To keep you running to schedule the Garmin DriveSmart 61LMT-D Sat Nav , \u0026pound199, save \u0026pound50.99, is able to use DAB digital radio data to keep you updated on current traffic on your route.

Create a music playlist they\u0027ll love  Many parents will remember the days when FM radio and a creaky tape deck were the only option for long car journeys. Thankfully, things have improved with a range of car stereos that allow you to stream online music services like Spoty, and radio stations from your phone.   If your radio is lacking Bluetooth support then maybe it’s time to upgrade. A Pioneer MVH-AV290BT Car Stereo  is now \u0026pound120 and can link to any phone that supports Bluetooth.

Remember, most streaming services allow you to download songs to your phone before you set off. This will save you data on a long journey and ensure you don\u0027t have to sit in silence when your phone signal gets too weak. You might even like to try downloading an audiobook or podcast  you can find a topic everybody is interested in. Take DVDs to watch  As nice as music is, it can sometimes generate little arguments of its own. The kids want Ed Sheeran and the adults want Queen and never the twain shall meet. In those situations it might be time to give the kids something else to do.  It\u0027s well worth settling them down with a Nextbase Car 9 Portable In-Car DVD Player , \u0026pound99. It\u0027s a DVD and media player with a nine-inch screen and support for USB storage and SD cards to play music and video files.

Jodie Brown, 20, was staying at the Steigenburger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada, when she started to feel sick days into the dream holiday with her partner Samuel Gibson. After ing to the UK, Jodie, from South Shields, spent two days in hospital when she ed to the UK, and claims Public Health England confirmed she had salmonella poisoning. Now, as investigations into the hotel continue following the deaths of John and Susan in August, Jodie is launching legal action against package holiday providers Thomas Cook through Hudgell Solicitors.  Jodie had visited the five star rated hotel with her partner, Samuel, 23, having identied it as their dream destination and saving around \u0026pound1,200 plus spending money for a week-long break. However, they alleged within days of arriving on June 11 – and without having left the hotel complex – Jodie became feverish, dizzy and faint. Jodie, who lost a stone in weight during the ordeal, claims she feared she\u0027d die as her condition worsened on holiday and she was forced to stay in bed for four days. She then spent a month recovering from her ordeal at home. Speaking about her experience at the hotel, Jodie said: The buffet was running for hours and new food was just being placed on top of food that had been there for a long time. It wasn’t being replaced, just piled on top. It has been absolutely shocking to learn about the couple who died when at the hotel just a couple of months after we were there, especially having been so ill myself.  The whole experience was horrying, frightening and painful, the most traumatic of my le. I have never felt anywhere near as ill as that in all my le and it was so bad at times that I was worried that I may die. Confined to her bed for days on end, Jodie said she was left unable to walk and constantly thought she was about to pass out. I felt like my insides were shutting down, I could barely walk without feeling like I was going to faint. It obviously ruined the entire holiday but I have been ill since I got back also. I have really struggled mentally and haven’t been eating well. I lost a stone in weight and I just don’t feel right. I used to be very active and went to the gym regularly but I just don’t have that energy at the minute. Samuel took Jodie straight to A\u0026ampE at South Tyneside Hospital as soon as they landed in the UK, where she was treated over two days, spending 24 hours on a drip having suffered from dehydration. When discharged she was advised to stay in bed for the next few days, before they were then told she had suffered from food poisoning through salmonella, which is usually called by eating contaminated, undercooked meat, raw or undercooked eggs.  Jodie added: The hotel doctor thought I had a throat infection. “I had classic fever symptoms of hot and cold flashes with extreme nausea and diarrhoea, but on our fourth day I became much worse and spent most of the day in bed. It developed to a point of critical illness, with a very strong fever, stomach cramps, sickness and diarrhoea. “This continued for the last two days of our holiday and I was getting worse. I worried I wouldn\u0027t make it home as she couldn\u0027t get out of bed, was feeling very faint, and had to be next to a toilet at all times. It was a holiday from hell and I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d make it home I felt that unwell and I\u0027d not eaten or drank anything for days. As soon as the plane landed back in the UK I went straight to hospital and needed three drips as I was so dehydrated. “At the time we did not know it was as serious as salmonella poisoning either.” Solicitor Paul McClorry, of Hudgell Solicitors, is representing an increasing number of people currently who, like Jodie, have suffered illness when staying at the hotel this summer. He said: “We are representing many people who have stayed at the hotel from early April to late August this year who have been seriously ill.

The partially-assembled 747 was one of the main attractions at this year\u0027s Burning Man , an extravagant week-long party that attracts 80,000 revellers to the state\u0027s remote Black Rock desert.  Now angry officials say Burning Man volunteers are trespassing on public land after they moved the 40-foot tall aircraft to a new location without authorisation.  One of the main principles of the environmentally-conscious festival, which promotes \u0027decommodication\u0027 and self-reliance, is to \u0027leave no trace\u0027.  It was moved off the event site without authorisation. So its legal status is in trespass with unauthorised use, Rudy Evenson of US Buerau of Land Management  told the Reno Gazette Journal .  Bottom line is, we\u0027re evaluating options for getting rid of it. Big Imagination, the collective that organises Burning Man, introduced the installation in 2015 after they gutted the defunct plane and decorated it with luminous LED lights. The group has now issued an online statement to allay concerns that future editions of the festival are under threat. Volunteers have been told by BLM that they must reapply for a permit to transport the plane after it ran out earlier this month.  In a statement on their website , Big Imagination insist that they have not abandoned the jet and say they simply want to park it at a nearby storage facility.   They said: As a collective of 500+ volunteers who have been working on this since 2014 the last thing we would want to do is to leave behind an ecological disaster on the playa or in any way impact Burning Man from getting their permit,\u0027 they said. We acknowledge that our exodus plan has not gone as expected and we apologize for any undue stress this has caused to the greater burner community, for the Burning Man Org, and especially the BLM with whom we\u0027ve always sought good relations and whom we are working closely with to resolve this situation as rapidly as possible. We are working with the BLM to move the plane into its storage location in a manner that is in compliance with the requisite regulations and also in good stewardship of the land.

The huge soft drink company is closely watching the fast-growing marijuana drinks market for a possible entry that would expand the world’s largest soft drink maker’s ambitions further away from sugary sodas. Coca-Cola announced its interest in a statement on Monday, responding to a report from BNN Bloomberg that said it was in talks with Canada’s Aurora Cannabis Inc to develop drinks infused with cannabidiol , the non-psychoactive chemical found in marijuana. Coke would join a rush by major alcohol makers and a cigarette company to test the cannabis market and find partners ahead of the October 17 launch of legal recreational marijuana in Canada.  Coke and Aurora, in separate statements, each said they were interested in cannabidiol-infused beverages but would not comment on any specics or talks. Aurora’s stock soared 17 percent, while Coke’s edged up slightly. The CBD drinks would likely aim to ease inflammation, pain and cramping, the BNN report said. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog called the news “an exciting potential development” as it would take Coke into another fast-growing healthier segment following last month’s 5.1 billion deal for Costa Coffee and expand cannabis-infused drinks in the area of al wellness products. The CBD products likely would be dferent from those produced by alcohol makers, which would likely give drinkers a buzz from tetrahydrocannabinol , the main psychoactive chemical in marijuana.  Beer makers Constellation Brands, Molson Coors and Heineken are all playing in the market for cannabis products. For example, Heineken’s craft beer Lagunitas recently launched Hi-Fi Hops, a beer-flavored sparkling water with THC and CBD. “The THC beverages probably sit better with the beer makers, and maybe CBD fits better with Coke, in terms of playing off the health trend,” said Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg. Canada is the first major economy to legalize recreational marijuana, and shares in cannabis producers have rallied in anticipation. New Cannabis Ventures\u0027 global cannabis stock index has risen about 87 per cent over the past year. Several US states have legalized marijuana but it remains against federal law. Cannabis\u0027 legal status is being reviewed by the UK government - so what does this actually mean? Currently, cannabis is a Class B drug and that is not going to change. That means possession will still carry an unlimited fine and up to five years\u0027 jail - rising to 14 years for dealers. And recreational use will be illegal. But the \u0027schedule\u0027, which sets out how a drug can be used for medical purposes, is now being reviewed by the Home Office. Currently, cannabis is Schedule 1 - meaning it has \u0027no therapeutic value\u0027 in the eyes of the law. If a medical benefit is identied, that schedule will change, meaning you could get it on prescription. This would likely only apply to certain forms like cannabis oil, rather than leaves that can be smoked. Separately, there is already a system where patients can get a \u0027licence\u0027 to use cannabis, even though it\u0027s against the law. This is very rare but has happened in the cases of epileptic boys Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell. This licensing system is also being overhauled, with a new panel of medical experts set up to advise the Home Office on future cases."},{"url":null,"title":"intelligent people swear more stay","story":"NewsIntelligent people swear more, stay up late and leave their work desks messySweary, messy people with a habit of sleeping in late are smarter than their peers, according to these studiesShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNeil Murphy10:35, 18 SEP 2018NewsBarack Obama is an avowed night owl \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailScientic research has found that those with higher IQs tend to swear more, stay up late and often leave their work desks messy.  Research published by the Language Sciences journal revealed that people who tend to swear more may in fact have a larger vocabulary than those who avoid profanities.  Popular belief assumes that those who frequently use swear only do so because they are unable to express themselves in another way. Findings by the study\u0027s authors, Kristin and Timothy Jay, show that the reverse may actually be true.  Participants were tested on their vocabulary using a short word test. Those who recorded the most swear words in a minute also tended to have more verbal fluency and higher associated IQ scores. The study concluded that those with a large vocabulary of \u0027taboo\u0027 words are merely illustrating their greater command of the English language.  Only \u0027dull\u0027 people are early to bed, early to rise  Another fascinating study revealed night owls tend to show higher IQs than those who go to bed early. President Obama, Charles Darwin, Winston Churchill, Keith Richards and Elvis Presley have all shown nocturnal habits. Analysis of a large sample of young Americans showed that children who go to bed later during weekdays and sleep in during the weekends grow up to be smarter adults. Those described as having a very dull IQ went to bed at around 23:41 on weeknights whereas those considered very bright went to bed around 00:29.

When Alita Brydon got home in the early hours after a brilliant night out with her match, she was lying in bed and thought he was The One. They had been exchanging personal, intimate, yet so mundane messages for a while, but living two hours apart meant it was tricky to arrange a meeting. They talked about films they loved, and exchanged step-by-step photos of the meals they prepared for dinner in the evenings.  And then finally their diaries matched up, and they arranged to go for a drink.  Writing for MamaMia , Alita said: I saw him confidently approaching me, striding past the Asian grocer, the dingy Chinese takeout.  Without saying a word he laid his lips on me, laid his palm on my lower back and kissed me. It was happening. Everything was coming together.

Five school staff members are accused of failing to report the alleged attack which took place on August 14 and attempting to abort the baby by giving the student drinks mixed with drugs.  The girl, who lived in a hostel at the boarding school with her sister, confided in her sibling before falling ill. Police were made aware of the alleged attack around a month later.

I don’t want to criticise the referee but, according to me, it was a very soft penalty.“I asked my players  there was contact there but they didn’t think it was one which you have to give.”Of United’s display, Csaba added: “I think for 90 minutes plus added time we played one-way football.“The boys tried hard and it’s not easy when the clock is ticking down and you still can’t score.“In the first-half we had two very good chances where we should score and in the second half we were pressing Morton.“They were, more or less, 11 behind the ball playing very deep and they tried to counter attack.“Sometimes you have these games where you have to suffer but we have to be more clinical, must be more clinical.“We can talk about the many mistakes but we have to play faster, more with the ball into feet and up front but I think on Saturday everybody showed spirit.”n INVERNESS went to the top of the Championship after a 3-2 home win over Partick Thistle on Saturday.Goals from Jordon White, Shaun Rooney and Sean Welsh, the latter netting from the penalty spot, had Caley comfortably in front.Blair Spittal pulled a goal back with eight minutes remaining before Kris Doolan added a second in injury time.Meanwhile, Highland rivals Ross County relinquished top spot with a goalless draw away to Queen of the South.Ayr United came from 2-0 down to beat Falkirk 3-2 and leave the Bairns still looking for their first points of the season.Dunfermline drew 0-0 at home to Alloa.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9b902a01761.jpg ","title":"dundee united new boy booth says he shouldnt have tried to run off injury","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCallum Booth admits had he been a Dundee United veteran instead of a rookie, two months into the season Arabs would have seen a lot more of him than they have.The 27-year-old is ready for today’s Championship clash with Morton at Tannadice and,  he completes the 90 minutes, it will be the first time since his debut in mid-July.That’s when he damaged ankle ligaments in the Betfred Cup defeat at Ross County, an injury suffered early on in the tie.It could have forced him off immediately but the fact he played on was, he admits, a mistake on his part that was caused by him being new to the team.“Firstly, it’s been good to be back, obviously being out for five weeks was a long time,” said the former Partick Thistle defender.“It felt like ages, especially when you join a new club because you just want to make good impressions and get games under your belt right away.“It was my ankle, I did in it in the first half at Ross County and quite stupidly played on.“The physio came on, had a look and I thought I could probably run it off. I did feel it for the rest of the game but being at a new club you just want to show up well in your first game.“If I’d been here a couple of years I would have come off but, because it was my first game, I stayed on and probably made it worse – I woke up the next day and it was agony.“The result was five weeks out and that wasn’t ideal but it’s in the past now and I’m raring to go.”What he isn’t doing is expecting to walk right back into the team and he knows, in the shape of fellow left-back Jamie Robson, he’s facing strong competition for that defensive berth.“Jamie has been doing really well, he’s a good player and it’s good to have competition. There are a few boys still out and they’re coming back, so there’s going to be even more and that can only be good for the squad.“I feel that, when we have everyone fit, we have a very strong squad and it’s just going to be a case of getting everyone fit and keeping it that way. There are always injuries, though, it’s part and parcel of football.”His mission now is to help however he can as United look to keep picking up points to mount a strong promotion challenge.The aim today is to pick up three points. He knows that will not be easy against a Morton side who will be something of an unknown quantity after their recent change of manager.It saw ex-United boss Ray McKinnon quit after just three months in chare to take over at Falkirk and former Rangers star Jonatan Johansson replace him.“Any team that gets a new manager, they usually take a couple of weeks to implement what the new man is trying to do. This is Johansson’s first game in charge so we are not really too sure how they’ll set up.“One thing we know is they have good inidual players and experience in there as well in the middle of the park.“It’s going to be a tough game and they are a good side. They’ve had a good couple of seasons where they’ve always been in or close to the play-offs and done well in a few cups.”For United the aim is to build on a three-game unbeaten run that’s seen seven points taken from the last nine, though Booth believes it should have been a full house.“We are going not too bad but,  we want to be winning the league, we have to be holding on to results like the one we should have had at Alloa last time out.“We didn’t play great but 1-0 going into the last 10 minutes, we should have seen the game out. Still, seven points from the last nine after a tricky start to the season is not too bad.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/VA-Dundee-promo.jpg ","title":"online shopping blamed as dundee gallery to close its doors after 30 years","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA 30-year-old Dundee business has been forced to shut down, citing internet shopping for a reduction in footfall.Westport Gallery Studio, on Old Hawkhill, will be closing its doors for the final time early next month.Jean McLaren, who has been working in the store for about 25 years, said: “It is with great sadness that we announce the closure of Westport Gallery Studio.“We recognise that the world of retail is changing and unfortunately we can no longer compete.“We would ask all customers that have gt vouchers or credit notes to redeem them as soon as possible.”The business was housed in two sites on Old Hawkhill until about four years ago, when one closed and is now occupied by restaurant Gallery 48, and the stock was moved to the smaller one next to Spex Pistols.Margaret Bain originally started working for the company as a bookkeeper in the larger premises about 18 years ago.

We’ve been rehearsing and have just played at the Glenfiddich Festival Experiment so we’re on a roll. We can’t wait to play for everyone.”Dundee two-piece St Martiins are next up, performing a set at 12.40pm.

We’re extremely lucky as a band and I want to see more people get the chance to get involved in the music business. Today’s going to be great – we’re so happy that we were asked.”At 1.30pm is Andrew Wasylyk, the alias of Dundee writer and producer Andrew Mitchell.He describes his work as being “cinematic nostalgia” with “elements of Baroque pop and the influence of classic 1970s songwriters”. Andrew said: “It’s a privilege to be involved and to play a small part in the opening of this new chapter for the city. I’m a fan of Kengo Kuma’s architecture and I’m excited to see the V\u0026ampA evolve and grow with the local communities. I’m really looking forward to performing with a nine-piece ensemble.”Kyle Falconer  – frontman of The View – is the most familiar name on the bill and he will appear on-stage at 2.30pm. The Dryburgh lad has been on tour promoting his debut solo album No Thank You of late, and is expected to perform hits from that LP along with a few well-known tunes from the band that made him famous.Another familiar face appears at 3.30pm in Be Charlotte  – the stage name of local singer Charlotte Brimner.She continues to make a name for herself, having signed a record deal earlier this year and performed last night before Primal Scream on the first day of the 3D Festival.Rounding the day off will be Danny Wilson icon Gary Clark, who’ll play a solo set to his hometown from 4.30pm before being joined by Sistema – the children’s schools orchestra – at 4.50pm to bring the festival to a close. Gary found fame with hits like Mary’s Prayer – which is expected to get an outing today.Organisers say the festival is all-standing and entry is via two gates on Thomson Avenue.Those attending aren’t allowed to take food or drink but outlets will be available.There will be a host of other activities taking place at Slessor Gardens, including a special event involving The Beano – where children can complete a comic cell in an attempt to break a world record.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/VA-Dundee-promo.jpg ","title":"va dundee huge queue as museum opens to wider public after debut weekend","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA large queue of eager visitors has formed as people aim to get their first glimpse of the V\u0026ampA Dundee.After a weekend of celebrations and exclusive access to lucky ballot winners, the museum opened its doors to the general public.The iconic building officially opened at 10am today.\u0026mdash Mary\u0026#39sChapelProject  September 17, 2018Shortly after the opening time, a large queue had formed \u0026#8211 stretching past the RRS Discovery.The iconic £80 million museum welcomed thousands of visitors over Saturday and Sunday.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0027 historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0027 committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0027 financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0027 a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Tuesday 18 Sep 2018 1:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117524.jpg","title":"Black Isle riders go the distance","story":"\u0026nbspPLANS to develop top-notch all-weather sports facilities in a Black Isle village took a step forward last week when 25 riders saddled up in Avoch for a 50-mile ride around the peninsula.The Vuelta de Isla Negra \u0026mdash translated as cycle around the Black Isle \u0026mdash was inspired by a Spanish event which takes place at the same time and saw members of the business community team up to chase a \u0026pound300,000 fundraising target for the facilities in Avoch.Law firm Ledingham Chalmers, which has offices in Inverness, Aberdeen, Stirling and Edinburgh, staged the event on Friday in support of Avoch Amenities Association\u0027 bid to transform an old bowling green into tennis and all-weather multi-sports courts with changing facilities.Senior associate Roddy Cormack came up with the idea for the event last year.

They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for...

It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Tuesday 18 Sep 2018 1:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117485.jpg","title":"North consituency could be bigger than Jamaica","story":"\u0026nbspFURIOUS Highlanders have slammed planned constituency boundary changes that will leave communities nearly 180 miles apart with the same MP \u0026ndash who will be representing an area larger than Jamaica.The Electorial Commission this week published proposed new boundary changes which are intended to cut the number of MPs in Westminster from 650 to 600.The changes are aimed at creating constituencies with similar population sizes.But this has caused consternation among parts of the UK with lower population densities, which are facing a cull in the number of their MPs.The Highlands is among those areas being hit, with its MPs being cut from three to two \u0026ndash should the recommendations be approved.Drew Hendry, the MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, said the proposals \"defy logic\".He said: \"We should be working to bring democracy closer to people not further away.\"These proposals show a complete lack of understanding of the Highlands and Islands, our communities and our landscape.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautul and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they ed to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they ed to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terric work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering  the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby. He is now planning to have a break from competing for the rest of year to give the car a well deserved rest and some TLC.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead library is breeding bookworms","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 11/09/18, 11:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead youngsters have been rewarded for their efforts in this summer\u0026#8217s library reading challenge.As part of the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge, the children were to visit their local library and read three books over the summer holidays.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust. The next championships will be held at Inveralmond Community High School, Livingston, on Sunday March 10 2019.More details are on our website \u0026#8211 www.thechampionships.Last March, 145 schools from Scotland and two from England were represented at the championships, with a category for all standards of playing.Five years ago we introduced a new category of \u0026#8216freestyle\u0026#8217.  The aim of this is to provide an opportunity for schools to showcase their other musical skills alongside those of their pipers.The Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust  hopes many young pipers and drummers from Mid Argyll \u0026#8211 with other musicians too  entering the freestyle event – will participate in next year’s championships.Patrick Gascoigne, administrator, Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"achnaba blackie lambs win james weir trophy","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/09/18, 6:51 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowUnited Auctions held its annual Dalmally show and sale of blackface wedder lambs, sponsored by the Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association, on Saturday September 8.Including all classes of cross bred lambs and feeding sheep there was a catalogued entry of 8,002 of lambs and sheep, selling to a packed ringside of buyers.William Dunlop of Elmscleugh judged the ious classes of blackface lambs and his awards are as follows:  First and champion pen, taking the James Weir Memorial Trophy – Achnaba \u0026#8211 £58.In second place was Tullochan \u0026#8211 £51 and third Tayvallich Estate \u0026#8211 £45.50.In line with other centres lambs were weighing two to three kg lighter on the year.

MTV have launched a new channel - Club MTV - that films at the best clubs across the country. Now Furys has been selected as one of the elite for broadcast. MTV will provide a DJ for the night and all revellers have to do is turn up and get their groove on. Furys manager Steven Muir said: “MTV are doing a freshers’ tour for filming and they asked  we want to be part of it. “They were targeting big university cities and some towns. “They picked us as they had seen we won the nightclub award and UWS had grown in stature.” Steven said Furys is getting bigger and better and they are delighted to be selected as one of the clubs to be filmed.  He added: “MTV film the night and it will be aired later on in the spring on the Club MTV chance. “This is the people of Ayr’s chance to get on TV, so what we have done is ask that people come dressed smart and show off the town. “It will just be a normal night in Furys, and they asked to do it on one of our iconic nights. “So Skints on a Thursday was chosen, as that’s a busy night for students and has been running for about 10 years. “We sold out all the booths within a few hours of advertising, and the tickets are flying off the shelves. “I am advising everyone to get tickets soon, as this will no doubt be a full house.” The event occurs on Thursday, October 4 at Furys Nightclub on Nile Court.

Jockey Oisin Murphy has made this year his own, riding the crest of the proverbial wave to land another Group 1 victory. It was always the worry that enigmatic HARRY ANGEL would lose his race in the stalls which he sadly did. It was a proper thrill to watch last years Arc winner ENABLE  to the track after a y absence with a decisive victory over CRYSTAL OCEAN. The John Gosden trained filly is now as short as 9/4 to retain her crown at Longchamp on October 7. With five Group 1 victories to her name you have to fancy her chances. For most of us the daily commute to work is no more hazardous than the annoyance of a late bus or a car that won’t start. Few will use a single engine plane or helicopter. It may look glamorous from the outside but for top trainers and jockeys who are engaged at two tracks on the same day it is an essential form of transport. The perils involved were highlighted on Saturday when trainer Richard Hannon’s plane collided with another on landing at a rain sodden Haydock. Mercully the only damage was to the clipped wings of the aircraft. Lets not always envy those who look as though they are living the high le. The climax to four days of racing at Doncaster comes this Saturday at 3:35pm in the final Classic of the season. Early in the week Aidan O’Brien’s KEW GARDENS was a rock solid favourite at 5/4 with LAH TI DAR  a remote second. The money has come for the Andrew Lloyd-Webber owned filly who is now favourite at 15/8 while KEW GARDENS can be backed at 2/1. LAH TI DAR  is three wins from three starts. The latest of which, the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at York’s Ebor Festival, was a 10  rout.  In the St Leger fillies are in receipt of a 3lb weight allowance against the colts in this 1 mile 6 marathon. It is a race that John Gosden excels in  having won it four times previously. Connections are confident the step up in trip will suit her strong galloping style and that any ease in the ground will suit the daughter of DUBAWI. With just one race this summer she should arrive at post on Saturday fresh as a daisy. In contrast this will be KEW GARDENS\u0027 fth engagement of the campaign. One we like and who has stamina in abundance is KEW GARDENS\u0027 stablemate SOUTHERN FRANCE at 14/1. Lightly raced, this son of GALLILEO has caught the eye on more than one occasion despite running a touch green in second behind KEW GARDENS in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot. SOUTHERN FRANCE  looks the value each way bet. In a tactical race he may be up in the vanguard keeping LAH TI DAR honest, forcing a true gallop. If there is a flaw to be found in the new favourite as she steps up in trip and in to Group 1 company for the first time, SOUTHERN FRANCE will be sure to find it. It is a tactic that will suit KEW GARDENS whose best performances have come under a patient ride. Perhaps our selection will outstay them both.

urgent call was made at the beginning of July to collect the money in just two months.\nAnd on Thursday, August 30, thanks to the efforts of hundreds of people, companies in Tweeddale and many other local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants, which means that the theatre now has the budget to transform its auditorium.\nThe revamp forms phase one of the \u0027Building on success\u0027 strategy to develop the building and make it more customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further afield have an arts venue well equipped to meet future needs.\nDonations to the appeal came in all shapes and sizes ranging from a little boy who put 50p of his pocket money into the donations box in the foyer to an American couple who transferred a four-figure sum. A bullock donated by local farmer Robert Barr now has Muchacoo  on his passport after dozens of visitors to the Peebles Agricultural show each paid \u0026pound5 to name him.\nAll of the money raised will go towards the development of the Eastgate Theatre building.\nDiscussions are already underway about progressing to phase two which will improve and reconfigure the foyer/caf\u0026eacute areas.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sheriff-orders-gala-woman-to-hand-over-car-keys","story":"A GALASHIELS woman has been ordered to give up her car keys after being accused of two drink driving offences in the space of two months.\nJune McKain has been told she cannot drive a vehicle until the outcome of her trial in November.\nThe 58-year-old of Ladhope Crescent, appeared from custody at Selkirk Sherf Court where she pleaded not guilty to a charge of driving with a breath/alcohol count of 42 microgrammes -

security risk or pay a firm like Securicor to pick it up.\n\u0026ldquoThe bottom line is so hard we have to take advantage where we can.\nHe said the decision to go cashless means his insurance premiums are lower as cash is not kept on the premises.\nThe pub, which has a 12-seater cinema in an outbuilding, is focused on food and Mr Keen said there was around a 60-40 split on food versus drink sales.\nHe said card payments cost him up to 1.5% per transaction.\nThe system of card machines is backed up with dongles in case there are problems with the internet connection, Mr Keen said,

formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two

Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour.

McLean, 43, pleaded guilty when she appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court last month and she ed to the dock last Wednesday for sentencing.  Defending solicitor Mary Moultrie said that McLean had been \u0026ldquoclaiming for her children and that she was now separated from Mr Cairns.  Ms Moultrie added that her client was \u0026ldquodeeply ashamed at appearing in court and that she had \u0026ldquoshown insight into her offending.  Sherf John Cook noted that this was McLean\u0026rsquos first offence and said \u0026ldquoa community-based disposal was \u0026ldquoappropriate in this case.  The sherf told McLean that she must complete 120 hours of unpaid work in the community as punishment for the offence.  McLean admitted obtaining \u0026pound5,000 of income support she was not entitled to between April 1, 2016, and August 11 last year.  She also pleaded guilty to claiming \u0026pound1,000 of jobseeker\u0026rsquos allowance she was not entitled to between August 12 and December 21 last year.

They applied for permission to sell drinks so that customers could enjoy \u0026ldquoa cold beer on a summer evening after demand for local produce from their customers grew.  Pauline told East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in a statement: \u0026ldquoWe are stocking more and more local produce as there is a clear want for this in the village.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to stock for sale and consumption on the premises and garden some local cider, beer, wine and gin from, for example Thistly Cross and NB Gin, supporting local crafters and providing the village with these items without having to commute too far.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.  The committee voted to reject the recommendation to approve the plans by seven votes to four."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-hotel-shuts-suddenly","story":"  The County Hotel, run since 2016 by Tony Breathnach, has been shut since last Thursday.\u0026nbsp  The 10-bedroom High Street hotel, which also includes a bar and dining area, was leased to Mr Breathnach by Star Pubs \u0026amp Bars, part of Heineken UK.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.

Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.

She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.  She interviews the recruits, who, after initial training, get to \u0026lsquoshadow\u0026rsquo a general adviser before going it alone with support from the session supervisor.  Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is interesting and is good  you can be of some use to people.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom at the CAB for half a day twice a week.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-high-streets-in-the-running-to-be-named-best-in-the-uk","story":"  The retail hotspots are all in the running to win a \u0026pound15,000 prize as part of the Great British High Street Awards 2018.

Newport-on-Tay is also in the running for the rising star award, as well as Prestwick Main Street and Ayr High Street.  The categories will now be put to a public vote, which counts for 30 per cent of the final score, before being looked at by a judging panel.  High Streets Minister Jake Berry MP said: \u0026ldquoCongratulations to all 38 high streets shortlisted for this year\u0026rsquos Great British High Street Awards.  \u0026ldquoThe awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding.  \u0026ldquoOver the next six weeks they have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they also battle it out in a public vote for the title of Britain\u0026rsquos best high street.  \u0026ldquoThis is a great opportunity to show your support for all the hard work taking place on our high streets, so get voting.  The shortlist comes after recent research by credit card firm Visa, which sponsors the awards, showed signs of renewed confidence in the country\u0026rsquos high streets despite a challenging retail environment.  The findings revealed that more than a third  of Scotland\u0026rsquos independent high street retailers are optimistic about the future of their local high street, while almost four out of five  Scottish shoppers claim they would miss their local high street  it was no longer there.  Sundeep Kaur, head of UK \u0026amp Ireland Merchant Services at Visa, said: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the nation\u0026rsquos high streets are transforming, this year\u0026rsquos Great British High Street Awards shortlist contains some fantastic examples of high streets and merchants which are evolving and embracing change to attract visitors.  \u0026ldquoIt is genuinely heartening to see so many businesses and communities that are harnessing their adaptability, resilience and creativity to offer the services and experiences that today\u0026rsquos shoppers want.  Author and TV presenter Simon Reeve, who will act as a judge, added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove spent the last couple of months visiting independent high street retailers across the UK and I\u0026rsquove been blown away by the passion and commitment shown by shopkeepers to keep their high streets alive, especially in this challenging climate.  \u0026ldquoThe best examples are those that are listening closely to their customers and innovating to meet their demands. These are the shops and high streets that will stand the test of time.  A total of 38 high streets have been shortlisted for the 2018 awards, which are organised by the Ministry of Housing, Communities \u0026amp Local Government.

A new report says just one in ten Scots think that the UK government has managed immigration competently and fairly and the authors say urgent action is need to restore public trust. Across the UK they are slightly more supportive with only 15% backing Britain\u0027s handling of immigration.  The figures come from the largest-ever public consultation on immigration, ahead of the independent Migration Advisory Committee\u0026rsquos immigration report on Tuesday expected to be pivotal to shaping Theresa May\u0026rsquos post-Brexit immigration policy.    Nicola Sturgeon has made repeated calls for a Scottish-specic immigration system in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.  But the Home Office believes that applying dferent immigration rules to dferent parts of the UK would complicate the system, harming its integrity, and cause dficulties for employers who they say need the flexibility to deploy their staff to dferent parts of the UK.  It says that it will engage with and consider the views of the Scottish Government and businesses when deciding on any action over the MAC findings.  The new report from the National Conversation on Immigration, co-ordinated by think tank British Future and anti-prejudice campaigners HOPE not hate, said that even the English agreed that Scotland should take control.  Some 55% across the UK said the devolved governments should have powers over immigration. The policy is also supported by half of those who live in the Midlands  and the south east  and by Leave  and Remain  voters.    Stuart McDonald, the SNP spokesman on immigration, asylum and border control said: \u0026ldquoThe support for devolution of migration powers recorded by the National Conversation is hugely signicant and welcome. Not only in Scotland, but across the UK, people have had enough of one-size-fits-all migration rules and do not believe that the UK government will deliver competent or fair migration policies.  \u0026ldquoIt is more urgent that ever for the UK government to devolve migration powers to the Scottish Parliament, so we can build a system that is designed to meet Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and aspirations \u0026ndash for example, a post-study work visa, rules that allow families to stay together, and visas that encourage people to work, start businesses and invest here.  The First Minister has argued that Scotland needs power over immigration to attract more people north of the border where there is a rapidly ageing population.    But earlier this month, CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn, one of the most influential figures in British industry said that businesses are not ready for a separate Scottish immigration system.  Earlier this month, the Home Secretary unveiled a pilot scheme that will allow fruit and vegetable growers to recruit non-EU migrants as seasonal workers - but critics say it goes \"nowhere near\" far enough to plug a recruitment crisis in Scots fruit-picking industry.  The new report calls for an annual \u0026lsquoMigration Day\u0026rsquo in Parliament, where ministers are held accountable for their performance against a three-year immigration strategy that it says should replace the annual net migration target, and would have input from the devolved administrations.    Jill Rutter, director of strategy for British Future and co-author of the report, said: \u0026ldquoThe lack of trust we found in the government to manage immigration is quite shocking. People want to have their voices heard on the choices we make, and to hold their leaders to account on their promises.  \u0026ldquoWhile people do want the UK Government to have more control over who can come to the UK, most of them are \u0026lsquobalancers\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash they recognise the benefits of migration to Britain, both economically and culturally, but also voice concerns about pressures on public services and housing.  Rosie Carter of HOPE not hate, co-author of the report, added: \u0026ldquoImmigration is a national issue, but people see it through a local lens. Where people live, and their living conditions, makes a real dference \u0026ndash that includes the perceived impact of migration on their community, broader grievances about economic insecurity and levels of contact with migrants and ethnic minorities too.  \u0026ldquoAn official National Conversation on Immigration would give people a chance to express their concerns in a constructive debate, so anxieties are not driven underground or exploited by those seeking to stoke ision.    The research by ICM for the National Conversation, which polled 700 people in Scotland also found Scots were more positive about integration with 69% agreeing \u0026ldquoit is better when migrants commit to stay in Britain, put down roots and integrate, compared to 61% UK-wide.  And just 31% in Scotland agree that \u0026ldquoit is better when migrants come here to work for a few years without putting down roots and then  home\" against 39% UK-wide.  But the report also uncovered some dissenting voices in citizens\u0027 panels held across Scotland.  In four of the five citizens\u0026rsquo panels in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh and Paisley \u0026ndash some participants felt that international students were taking the place of Scottish students.  \"This view was more surprising, given that these four citizens\u0026rsquo panels held many positive views about other forms of migration,\" said the report.  Students who live in Scotland or are from EU countries do not have to pay tuition fees in Scottish universities.    \"This seems to have fuelled a belief that Scotland\u0026rsquos universities prioritise international students from outside the EU over Scottish students for financial reasons,\" said the report.  \"However, our nationally representative ICM survey did not indicate any statistically signicant dference in the desire to reduce the number of international students in Scotland  compared with all of the UK .\"  And some over two out of three Scots were happy for the numbers of international students to be increased or remain at the same level.  The Home Office said: \"Our immigration system is designed to work for the whole of the UK. We have no current plans to introduce a devolved immigration system.  \"Scotland, as well as other devolved governments, have dferent ways available to encourage more iniduals and families to move to their part of the UK.  National Conversation on Immigration researchers held over 130 meetings in 60 locations across every nation and region of the UK, with citizens\u0026rsquo panels, recruited to be representative of the local population, in each place alongside meetings with local government, businesses, faith and civil society groups.  In Scotland, panels were held in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Lerwick and Paisley.  Nationally representative research by ICM polled 3,667 people across the UK and an open online survey was completed by nearly 10,000 people.  Other Scottish findings  \u0026bull 62% agree that migrant workers support the British economy by doing jobs British people don\u0026rsquot want to do  \u0026bull 51% agree that public services are under strain because of immigration  \u0026bull 64% agree that migrants bring valuable skills for our economy and public services like the NHS  \u0026bull 51% agree that migrants are willing to work for less money so put jobs at risk and lower wages  \u0026bull 80% think the number of high-skilled migrants from the EU should remain the same or increase while 11% say they should be reduced.  \u0026bull 47% would like the number of low-skilled workers from the EU to be reduced while 34% think they should stay the same and 9% would like more.  \u0026bull 63% agree that the public should be consulted more on important national issues, like immigration.  Analysis:\u0026nbspScottish public are balancers  by Jill Rutter, Director of Strategy for British Future and co-author of the National Conversation on Immigration final report.    Immigration was one of the biggest issues of the EU referendum, but the public have not had a chance to say what should happen next.  The National Conversation on Immigration, jointly conducted by British Future and Hope not hate, is the largest ever public consultation on immigration.  Holding sixty citizens\u0026rsquo panels across the UK, including five in Scotland and a mixed English-Scottish panel in Berwick, it was a chance to hear the public\u0026rsquos voice.  These real-world conversations were constructive and pragmatic, in sharp contrast\u0026nbspto the more polarised online debate. We heard dferent views across Scotland: in Paisley, local faith and political leadership had shaped a public discourse that was more sympathetic to refugees and migrants than in similar places south of the border.  In Aberdeen, awareness of migration\u0026rsquos contribution to the oil industry was mixed with concerns about pressures on school places and housing. The Berwick citizens\u0026rsquo panel showed that views on migration can be toughest in places of low ersity and least contact.  Scotland has a distinctly more positive national immigration discourse. The Scottish public are balancers, seeing the gains of migration for the NHS and economy and wanting practical plans to manage the pressures too.  Asked to rate the overall impact of immigration on a 1-10 scale, the most common Scottish response is six out of ten, with a modest dference between the Scottish  and UK-wide  averages.  Views about whether Scotland should have more control over immigration policy often ided along independence referendum lines. There was more support in Paisley, while citizens in the Shetlands were firmly opposed.  But the sense that Westminster is distant and unlikely to consider Scotland\u0026rsquos needs transcends the independence question: a pro-Union panel in Edinburgh felt the City of London would dominate in decisions about future policy.  So 64% of Scots support devolving immigration powers, according to the survey that formed part of the National Conversation.    While political, business and civic society stakeholders saw a clear demographic need for immigration in Scotland, it was striking how the public were barely aware of the debate about future population needs. Scotland\u0026rsquos immigration \u0026lsquobalancers\u0026rsquo will be ready to hear that case, but a sustained national conversation on Scotland\u0026rsquos demographics will be needed for elite debate to be converted into a public one."},{"url":null,"title":"snps-brendan-ohara-calls-on-chancellor-to-continue-duty-freeze-on-scotch-whisky","story":"  Nationalist MP Brendan O\u0026rsquoHara, who chairs Westminster\u0026rsquos all-party parliamentary group on scotch whisky, echoed industry concerns, saying it was vital that businesses and sectors were protected and not burdened with a counterproductive and unnecessary tax hike.  He said: \u0026ldquoScotch whisky is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos major assets and a global success story. At a time of continued Brexit uncertainty and instability, we cannot risk or undermine our whisky industry by increasing the tax liability on our producers who are already contributing so much.  \u0026ldquoDespite the Treasury predicting lost revenues of \u0026pound225 million from the November duty freeze, they actually rose by \u0026pound113m. By contrast, when the Treasury increased revenues the previous March by 3.9per cent, revenues dropped by 7.2 per cent. Scotch whisky cannot be forced to bankroll the UK\u0026rsquos failing economic strategy, declared the Argyll and Bute MP.  \u0026ldquoFor too long the Treasury has viewed the industry as a \u0026lsquocash cow\u0026rsquo, as evidenced by last year\u0026rsquos counterproductive duty hike. That approach must come to an end and I call on the Chancellor to rule out unnecessary tax hikes and instead take heed of the economic reality and retain the duty freeze on scotch whisky to ensure that this vital Scottish industry continues to grow, he added.  The SNP stressed that scotch whisky was responsible for approximately a fth of UK food and drink exports and recently reported record numbers of visitors to distilleries and tourist centres. The industry supported more than 40,000 jobs directly and through its supply chain, it noted.  The Scotch Whisky Association \u0026ndash the sector\u0026rsquos trade body \u0026ndash has already said that a continued freeze would \u0026ldquonot only deliver greater revenue for the Treasury but also help to support an industry that has invested more than \u0026pound500m in capital projects over the last five years.  The Budget date is not yet known and it is thought Mr Hammond is waiting to name a date until there is clarity over the success or otherwise of the Brexit talks. This means that the economic statement might not come until the end of November or the beginning of December."},{"url":null,"title":"lib-dems-urge-corbyn-and-leonard-to-follow-khan-and-back-peoples-vote","story":"  But the conversion of the London Mayor to supporting a second referendum drew criticism from Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, who claimed holding such a vote would throw the whole Brexit process into \u0026ldquochaos.

Most families have to think hard about how to meet immediate expenses, while weighing up the long-term consequences of paying back loans when the average Scots student finishes their degree \u0026pound12k in debt.  Thankfully, however, indeed crucially, they are spared the distress of having to factor in the \u0026pound9,000 a year fees students in England have to pay, thus landing them with an eye-watering average loan of \u0026pound32k.  The Scottish Government has always robustly resisted calls to introduce a similar scheme, despite opponents arguing the position is hypocritical, since further education places have been cut to fund the policy. Critics also say it puts Scots universities at a disadvantage in terms of funding, restricts their ability to invest and forces a cap on student numbers.  And, as front page of the Herald on Sunday highlighted yesterday, it seems a number of senior Scots academics agree with this view.  The Principal of one university, who did not wish to be named, decried \u0026ldquolow investment in higher education from the Scottish Government for a decade and called for a gradual increase in fees for Scots students. They also lamented the \u0026ldquolack of a safe space to even explore the pros and cons of such a move.  Another executive team member at a top institution anonymously described free higher education as a \u0026ldquoprop for the middle classes and called for a national debate on how we fund our universities.  Now, I don\u0026rsquot doubt that these senior figures, whoever they are, have genuine concerns about funding \u0026ndashindeed, it\u0026rsquos their job to ask governments for more money.  But their reluctance to be open about their identity suggests an acute awareness of just how unpopular any change in the status quo would be.  And little wonder since a free university education is not only a principle that many Scots hold dear, but one of last crumbs of comfort Scottish families can rely on in these grim and uncertain times.  Normally I\u0026rsquom all in favour of national conversations, especially about the things that really matter. But in this case, I find myself drawn to the opposite response: now is definitely NOT the time to be having this particular debate.  At a time when many of us are already losing sleep over the potentially horrying economic ramications of Brexit, having suffered years of pitul wage growth and the chipping away of conditions that followed the financial crash, do parents really deserve the worry of an additional \u0026pound36k in fees should their children be bright enough to be offered a place at university? Young people, too, have enough on their plates dealing with the already costly chaos passed down by their parents\u0026rsquo and grandparents\u0026rsquo generations.  And make no mistake, before long \u0026pound9k a year  would be the reality. Those in favour of fees talk of a very gradual introduction at a low level, but as English students learned so brutally, such promises are easily thrown out with the bathwater alongside the principle of free education.  The fee brigade in Scotland  often talk of the continuing and shameful lack of young people from deprived backgrounds going on to university, and how free higher education subsidises the middle classes.  But it\u0026rsquos impossible to see how introducing \u0026pound9k a year fees will help these young people, especially when you look again to the experience of English students: despite a massive hike in course fees over a short period, in 2016 maintenance grants for the poorest were replaced with, yes, you guessed it, loans. I speak from experience as the first person in my family to go to university and the recipient of a full grant . I may still have decided to study had fees been in place, but I doubt I would have felt free to chose the academic path I did, one that enabled me to enjoy education for its own sake but also led me to the career I love.  I am very grateful for the opportunity I was given what right have I to tell others they should not have the same? I don\u0026rsquot have kids, but I\u0026rsquom more than happy for my taxes to be used for other people\u0026rsquos to receive the same free education I benefitted from.  After all, free university education is not a subsidy but rather a societal choice that represents an investment in young people to be paid back over the long term in many ways, not just economically, but intellectually and socially, too.

In further extracts from her interview, Mrs May was pushed on whether or not she had ruled out giving a special immigration arrangement for EU citizens and replied: \"What we will be doing is putting forward a set of rules for people from the European Union and people from outside the European Union.\"  She went on: \"Parliament will vote for a deal because people will see the importance of a deal that maintains a good trading relationship with the EU but also maintains good co-operation in other areas but gives us the freedom to take the benefits and opportunities of Brexit.\"  The PM cast doubt on whether or not the EU would offer a better deal  MPs were to reject her final proposal, adding: \"I believe we\u0027ll get a good deal we\u0027ll bring that back from the EU negotiations, put that to Parliament.  \u0026ldquoThe alternative to that will be not having a deal because a I don\u0027t think the negotiations will have that deal, and b we\u0027re leaving on March 29 2019.\"  But Sir Nick Clegg, the former Deputy PM, accused Mrs May of presenting Britain with a \"con trick\" choice on Brexit.  He explained: \"It is a deep disservice to our democratic traditions to have a Prime Minister now saying: \u0027You\u0027ve got no choices left, it\u0027s my fudge or the abyss\u0027 that is not true. We always have more choices  only we are prepared to take them.  \"Of all the con tricks we have been subject to in this whole sorry Brexit saga - from the lies in the referendum to the so-called virtues of what is nothing more than an inelegant fudge in Chequers - the worst is now to come, declared the former Liberal Democrat leader, who will be back in the spotlight today as he addresses a fringe event at the party\u0026rsquos annual conference in Brighton.  Mr Clegg said: \"We\u0027re now going to be told: \u0027It\u0027s my way or no way\u0027 it\u0027s either the Chequers fudge or a sort of cataclysmic clf-edge.  \"The idea that the only thing this country should accept is a fudge or the abyss is not only an insult to the intelligence of British voters but it\u0027s simply not true.\"  Sir Nick insisted that his experience as an MEP taught him that Britain would be given more time by the EU to reflect on what it wanted to happen ahead of the slated withdrawal date of next March.  \u0026ldquoThe clock is ticking but the clock can definitely be changed, he declared. \u0026ldquoOne thing that is very elastic in Brussels is time. They\u0027ve got a name for it. It\u0027s called \u0027stop the clock\u0027 and it is provided for in the EU treaties.\"  The former DPM said the UK could tell Brussels: \"\u0026rsquoI\u0027m sorry, we\u0027ve got a bit stuck here, we need more time to straighten ourselves out and decide what we want to do next.\u0026rsquo\"  He called for a pause in the withdrawal process so that the UK could hold a \"People\u0027s Vote\" on Brexit.  Sir Nick was scathing about the current Brexit situation, saying: \"It\u0027s the equivalent of leaving your home, locking your front door, chucking your key away and having absolutely no idea where you are going next.\"  The former party leader, who lost his Sheffield seat at the 2017 General Election, said he had been holding talks with European leaders on the Brexit situation to ensure the UK had more choices on what to do about its relationship with the EU.  In her BBC interview broadcast tonight, Mrs May also said she gets \u0026ldquoirritated by the debate about her leadership and criticised Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos controversial \u0026ldquosuicide vest comment.  Britain is heading full throttle for a total write-off of Brexit  it continues with Theresa May\u0027s disastrous plans for the Irish border, Boris Johnson has claimed.  The former Foreign Secretary launched another broadside against the PM\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan, saying the Irish border backstop deadlock was being used to force the UK into becoming a vassal state and that the talks were on course to end in a \"spectacular political car crash\".  Mr Johnson argued that the EU\u0026rsquos fall-back position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland being \"annexed\" by Brussels.  Alternative plans set out by Mrs May would \"effectively\" keep Britain in the bloc, he declared.  However, the PM has said the counter-proposal to her Chequers plan is \"still a hard border\" and hers is the only way that does not \"carve up the United Kingdom\".  His comments came as reports suggested the EU was preparing to accept the use of technology to avoid the need for new border infrastructure.  Mr Johnson has backed proposals by the pro-Brexit European Research Group that physical checks can be done away from the border, without keeping the UK or Northern Ireland tied to EU customs rules.  Writing in The Daily , he said: \"If the Brexit negotiations continue on this path they will end, I am afraid, in a spectacular political car crash.  \"If we are to get out of this mess and get the great British motor back on track, then we need to understand the Irish backstop and how it is being used to coerce the UK into becoming a vassal state of Brussels.  The former Cabinet minister claimed the EU\u0027s backstop would leave a border down the Irish sea while the UK\u0027s proposal left it \"volunteering\" to \"remain effectively in the customs union and large parts of the single market until Brussels says otherwise\".  Both versions of the backstop were \u0026ldquodisastrous,\" argued Mr Johnson. \"One threatens the Union the other version - and its close cousin, Chequers - keep us effectively in the EU, as humiliated rules-takers.  \"We need to challenge the assumptions of both these Irish backstops, or we are heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit.  \"We are straining at the gnat of the Irish border problem - in fact we haven\u0027t even tried to chew the gnat - and we are swallowing the camel of EU membership in all but name,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-the-tories-are-snatching-away-hope-from-the-children-who-need-it-most","story":"  In its 2016 Holyrood manesto, they welcomed \u0026ldquothe Scottish Government\u0026rsquos recent decision to reintroduce national testing in primary schools. Now Ruth Davidson makes hay attacking the policy, and tries to kill it off.  The politicisation \u0026ndash the weaponisation \u0026ndash of childhood in Scotland stinks to high heaven and it does not edy the nation. Parents are being tormented by two-faced politicians deploying scare tactics about the education of their children. This is not debate, this is double-dealing of the worst order. Sadly, it has been this way for a long time.  From the issue of a Named Person to advocate for young people who might not have the support they need, through to baby boxes, free tuition fees for university students, the smacking ban and now national testing for primary school pupils, you would be forgiven \u0026ndash  you listened to the opponents of the Scottish Government \u0026ndash for thinking that Nicola Sturgeon is the witch from Hansel and Gretel, ready to eat any child who passes her cottage at Bute House made of social democratic gingerbread.  Whether you support those policies or not \u0026ndash and I personally do support those policies as a voter and a parent \u0026ndash the portrayal of the SNP as a party pushing some Stalinist family-crushing plot is clearly bonkers, and those peddling such nonsense know it\u0026rsquos bonkers. But these days, it is often the crazy not the considerate who win the day.  I spoke to John Swinney, the Education Secretary and Deputy First Minister, last week about a growing opposition to free tuition fees by senior university executives. He made it clear that he saw everything to do with the welfare and education of children on a continuum from baby boxes to free university education.  It was all about \u0026ldquovalues, he said \u0026ndash about everyone in society chipping in with taxes to pay for education, and about the state putting out a message that every child, especially the poorest, are cared for, and matter.  Now, of course, you could dismiss Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos comments as political spin \u0026ndash but, I think, he\u0026rsquos telling the truth. Actions speak louder than words, and those policies listed above \u0026ndash the Named Person, baby boxes, the smacking ban, free tuition, national testing \u0026ndash are all saying the same thing to the electorate: we are trying to do the best by your kids. Trying does not mean succeeding, but at least they\u0026rsquore trying.  There\u0026rsquos plenty I disagree with the SNP about, but when it comes to the broad spectrum of policies intended to improve the lives of children, I believe it has the best intentions at heart. And it is trying its best because at the heart of our education system lies a very real problem that the party has to take responsibility for: the struggle to close the attainment gap between children from middle class backgrounds and those from low income homes.  Disadvantaged pupils achieve around half the qualications that the most affluent achieve \u0026ndash that is a failure, especially for a social democratic party.  The opponents of the SNP, chiefly led by the Tories, picked up the attainment problem as a cudgel, and, rightly, beat the SNP over the head with it. As a result, the SNP, rightly, tried to enact policies to close the attainment gap, including national testing \u0026hellip which the Tories supported, but now don\u0026rsquot support, because, like always, what the Tories care about is power and point-scoring not policies which help the worse off in society.  Let\u0026rsquos concentrate, however, on testing in primary schools \u0026ndash intended, obviously, to help monitor failings in attainment so they can be addressed as early as possible. We\u0026rsquore told that the tests are \u0026ldquotraumatising children \u0026ndash especially those in Primary One.  This is embarrassing nonsense. I know plenty of teachers \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquom married to one \u0026ndash and not a single teacher I\u0026rsquove spoken to thinks the tests are traumatising. In fact, they laugh when they hear that. They may not like the tests, they may think they\u0026rsquore pointless, that it adds to an already huge workload \u0026ndash but trauma? Come off it, they say.  Children don\u0026rsquot have to prepare for the tests. The tests are done on iPads so it doesn\u0026rsquot feel like some scary pen and paper assessment. The tests are also \u0026ldquoadaptive which means that  the child is having trouble answering questions then it becomes easier, and  the child is doing well the questions become harder. The tests don\u0026rsquot last long - in P1 it\u0026rsquoll take no longer that 30 minutes once a year.  Some teachers feel the \u0026ldquomumsnet brigade \u0026ndash sharp-elbowed middle-class parents who want to wrap their children in cotton wool \u0026ndash hate the tests because it means their little princes and princesses might not come out with gold stars and A-pluses. What horror \u0026ndash their child might be average.  There are also concerns that it\u0026rsquos these parents who are creating the climate of fear around the tests: tell your child something is scary and the child will find it scary allow the child to do the test without inculcating fear and they\u0026rsquoll see nothing to fear.  So it is within a climate of hypocrisy, fear and falsehood that we are now to see a debate and vote on national testing in primary one, orchestrated by the Tories, which the SNP, according to political insiders, is likely to lose. The Tories have created enough chaos  to block a policy they supported until it became political convenient not to.  We\u0026rsquore going to see a policy \u0026ndash albeit flawed in many eyes, but well-intentioned and crafted to deal with one of society\u0026rsquos biggest problems \u0026ndash sacriced on the altar of political conniving. A chance to do something meaningful in schools when it comes to the education of children will likely be snuffed out.  If there\u0026rsquos any kind of fairy tale metaphor here, it isn\u0026rsquot wicked witch Sturgeon coming to gobble up your children, it\u0026rsquos the Pinocchio-nosed Tory party snatching hope away from children who need it, and locking up opportunity in a high tower that only the wealthy have the keys to, not the poorest."},{"url":null,"title":"minister-to-be-quizzed-on-45m-loan-to-sturgeon-advisers-firm","story":"  The Scottish Tories have tabled an urgent question about the taxpayer funds - some given in secret - going to Ferguson Marine Engineering, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde.  The firm is part of the Clyde Blowers empire owned by Monaco-based engineering tycoon Jim McColl, who sits on the First Minister\u0026rsquos council of economic advisers.  In June, SNP finance secretary Derek Mackay publicly announced a \u0026pound30m loan to Ferguson Marine, which has fallen behind on a \u0026pound97m government contract for two new CalMac ferries.  However it emerged last week Mr Mackay also gave Ferguson\u0026rsquos a \u0026pound15m loan in September.  Although he informed Holyrood\u0026rsquos finance committee of the first loan, it was not made public until it was forced out of the government by a freedom of information request.  Tory MSP Jamie Greene, who tabled the question on the loans and their relationship to the troubled ferry contract, said the SNP appeared to be hiding the facts in the case.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen huge sums of public money are at stake, the public has a right to know what is going. The Minister needs to come to the chamber next week and do just that.

The Tory-dominated cross-party group said this was compared to 1.8% of GDP in a worst case Brexit that forced the UK to rely on WTO rules.  The SNP said the \u0026lsquoWin Win\u0026rsquo report on the benefits of the UK, released to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the No vote in 2014 referendum, was \u0026ldquoludicrously over the top.  Scottish Business UK was set up last year as a vehicle for pro-Union businesses in the event of a second independence referendum.  Its founder and chairman is millionaire Tory donor Robert Kilgour and its chief executive is former Scottish Tory MEP Struan Stevenson.  Mr Kilgour said the question mark over another independence vote was deterring business investment in Scotland and hurting the economy.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur report shows that a second referendum on independence for Scotland will be eight times more damaging than a worse case Brexit scenario to the Scottish economy, and that is a reality that no-one operating in businesses across Scotland could afford to come to fruition.  Mr Stevenson added: \u0026ldquoWe are four years from the last referendum on independence for Scotland which was not supported, yet the spectre of a further referendum remains ever present.  \"We\u0026rsquore calling on the Scottish Government to abandon the demand for another referendum and focus more on reigniting the Scottish economy, so we once again become a credible investment opportunity, on a par with other parts of the UK.  Labour Jackie Baillie MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis is yet more evidence of how damaging independence would be to our economy.  \"As the SNP itself admitted in its cuts commission, independence would mean decades of austerity, tax rises and massive reductions in public spending.  \"That is not what the people of Scotland need or want.  \"Nicola Sturgeon needs to stop putting nationalism before the NHS, schools and jobs.\"  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThese claims are so ludicrously over the top they show just how rattled the Tories are - they know support for independence has never been so consistently high or sustained, and that Brexit may well be the point of no .  ?\"Leaving the EU and a single market eight times bigger than the UK\u0027s alone threatens to be disastrous for Scotland - and the shambolic no-deal outcome the Tories are now preparing for would be utterly catastrophic.  ?\"Scotland is already one of the most productive parts of the UK outside London, with resources few countries can match, and independence would allow us to make the most of that huge potential.\""},{"url":null,"title":"cbi-joins-criticism-of-scottish-business-rates-levy","story":"  The CBI said plans to let councils levy a new charge on out-of-town stores and online retailer warehouses, such as those of Amazon, would deter investment and damage the economy.  The organisation, whose members employ 500,000 Scots, also said the levy would not work as a \u0026ldquounilateral measure in the global drive to tax the digital economy more effectively.  The out-of-town supplement, which is due to be piloted from 2020, is part of a suite of reforms to the business rates system instigated by last year\u0026rsquos Barclay Review.  The CBI welcomed a series of other measures in the Barclay Review, including more reliefs for new businesses, three-year revaluations, and greater transparency.  However it was scathing about the out-of-town levy, which the Barclay Review said should be \"modest\", set by inidual councils and used to help support struggling town centres.  The Scottish Retail Consortium has also strongly criticised the idea.  Calling for the plan to be abandoned, the CBI said the extra charge would hit a cross section of employers, such as garden centres, supermarkets and car dealerships, many of them already paying a separate supplement linked to their large size.  In a submission to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos consultation on the out-of-town charge, the CBI said: \u0026ldquoThe issue of taxation in the new digital economy is being debated across the world\u0026rsquos developed economies with the OECD , the EU and the UK government attempting to find multilateral and unilateral solutions for how to tax global online business.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish government will not be able to unilaterally address such complex issues by giving local councils the ability to impose an additional levy.  \u0026ldquoWhat an additional levy would do is hit a range of local businesses across Scotland that are doing their best to contribute to their local economies.  It said  ministers went ahead with the plan, there should be a range of safeguards including a \u0026ldquostatutory cap, clarity on how the money would be spent, and consultation with business.  CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: \u0026ldquoBusiness rates have been a bone of contention for far too long. While the Scottish Government should be applauded for taking action to remedy the situation, there\u0026rsquos still some way to go to build a regime that fits the Barclay Review\u0026rsquos goal of supporting business growth and long-term investment.  \u0026ldquoWhile we\u0026rsquore very sympathetic to the plight of high streets up and down the country, clobbering vital employers with a triple tax whammy is not the solution \u0026ndash instead we need smart, creative and sustainable proposals that revive local communities through increased economic activity. The idea for an out-of-town levy is a non-starter and the proposal should be scrapped immediately.  The Scottish Retail Consortium has called the out-of-town surcharge \u0026ldquoill-considered and poorly timed, and would add to the complexity of an already complicated system.  The Chartered Institute of Taxation said the levy should help the rates regime better reflect local priorities but was likely to be a \u0026ldquobureaucratic burden for already stretched councils.  A Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the consultation we launched in June, we are now seeking views on allowing up to three local councils to introduce pilot schemes in which businesses based predominantly online or out-of-town might be charged a modest business rates supplement.  \u0026ldquoThe proceeds from this supplement would be used to support rates relief for businesses in town centres and we are consulting on a range of appropriate safeguards, such as the need for consultation with all rate-payers who might potentially be affected.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that the consultation is as wide-ranging as possible and we would encourage all those with concerns or comments about the current business rates system to take part."},{"url":null,"title":"conference-sketch-corbyns-pants-mays-rubbish-and-the-lib-dems-wonderful","story":"  It could only be the Gospel according to St Nick.

A larger room had to be organised to accommodate the Clegg worshippers, clapping and cheering at their fallen hero, who unexpectedly lost his Sheffield seat in the 2017 snap poll.  Prof Clegg insisted he disagreed with Jo Swinson - never a wise move - who had cast doubt on some of the decisions of the Age of Stability that was the Lib-Con coalition.  St Nick puffed out his chest and insisted he was \u0026ldquoproud of his record in government, including \u0026ldquomassively reining in some of the darker Tory excesses.  Talking of which, he touched on his old Etonian chum that fallen Tory angel Dave. Whatever happened to him?  Cleggy, noting kindly how the thing the head Cameroon would be \u0026ldquoremembered for forever was calling that referendum, argued Dave was a \u0026ldquovery bad Conservative Prime Minister, much worse than when he led the Coalition, at which, St Nick admitted, he was adept.  Savouring the idea, Calamity pointed out that when his Tory chum finally achieved a majority government to lead in 2015, \u0026ldquoit all went utterly pear-shaped.  St Nick suggested the Tory brethren were now worshipping at the \u0026ldquotheological altar of Brexit, refusing to recognise the damage their dark religion would do the economy.  \u0026ldquoHistory will judge Theresa May very, very badly because she has allowed herself to become captive to that theological push.

St Nick blinked quickly and suggested the \u0026ldquowalloping his party received in 2015 was so hard that it would take time to recover. \u0026ldquoIt was like a boxer who was k\u0026rsquooed, as a party we were staggering around, a bit dizzy from the blows we had received.

He insisted: \u0026ldquoWe always have more choices  only we are prepared to take them.  Ian Blackford, the SNP\u0026rsquos Westminster leader, was equally aghast at Mrs May\u0026rsquos ultimatum.  \u0026ldquoIt would be utterly unforgivable to impose this reckless false choice. Theresa May must ditch her hard Brexit plans and get behind the SNP\u0027s compromise proposal to stay in the single market before it is too late,\" declared the Highland MP.  His Nationalist colleague, Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary, will today warn that Mrs May is leading the UK into a \u0026ldquochaotic blind Brexit with no clarity on the country\u0026rsquos future.  \u0026ldquoIt is misleading and the height of arrogance for the Prime Minister to say the only alternative to no-deal is the Tories\u0026rsquo flawed and unworkable Chequers Plan, which even they don\u0026rsquot agree on.  \u0026ldquoThe EU has been clear that the key economic planks of the Chequers Plan are not acceptable. That means there\u0026rsquos a growing danger that we are heading for a chaotic blind Brexit in which Scotland is dragged out of the EU with key questions on trade and the future relationship undecided and in the hands of hard-line anti-Europeans, he added.  This morning, the Commons Brexit Committee issued a report urging the PM to consider alternatives to her Chequers blueprint, which kept Britain aligned to Brussels to avoid a \"chaotic and damaging\" no-deal Brexit  her plan were rejected. Three committee members \u0026ndash Tories Jacob Rees-Mogg and Andrea Jenkyns and the DUP\u0026rsquos Sammy Wilson refused to endorse it.  The report came after the International Monetary Fund said all likely Brexit scenarios would \"entail costs for the UK economy\" but that a disorderly departure could lead to \"a signicantly worse outcome\".  Chancellor Philip Hammond also warned a no-deal would jeopardise the entire economic recovery since the 2008 financial crash.  Earlier, No 10 slapped down Boris Johnson after he again used his Daily  column to attack the Chequers Plan, saying under it Britain was \"heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit\".

Part of the reason for that is that childbirth, in all its bone-wrenching, bloody glory, just is traumatic, but part is that I, as an educated 30-something, was so utterly unprepared for what would happen to me.  Sure, I\u0026rsquod seen One Born Every Minute and listened to a candid friend\u0026rsquos memory of being \u0026ldquoaxed in half in the delivery room, but ultimately I must have been influenced by the dominant narrative around childbirth that always ends with the mother, hair and make-up intact, sitting up in bed \u0026ldquodoing just fine while looking lovingly at her progeny. To say that the reality came as a shock would be the understatement of the decade.  It is obviously impossible for me to say whether being better informed pre-birth would have made the actual experience any better for me, but the aversion to telling women the truth about childbirth \u0026ndash or at least to empowering women to tell their own truths about giving birth \u0026ndash is nonetheless troubling.  That there is an aversion was highlighted last week when a speech given at the British Science Festival by a Hull University lecturer received widespread media coverage. Having been asked to investigate tocophobia \u0026ndash an unreasonable dread of childbirth \u0026ndash by her local NHS, Catriona Jones said she had found that by using websites like Mumsnet to share their experiences of how traumatic childbirth can be, women are contributing to a climate of fear that is negatively impacting on other women.  \u0026ldquoIf you go online and you go into any of the Mumsnet forums there are women telling their stories of childbirth, and it was terrible, it was a bloodbath, and that can be quite frightening for women to engage with, she was widely quoted as saying.  This was seized on by the media, which to some extent demonised Mumsnet and the women who share their experiences on it. The problem is, that while these reports accurately reflected Ms Jones\u0026rsquos words, they failed to tell the whole story, with just one newspaper \u0026ndash The  \u0026ndash noting that she had also warned that cuts to antenatal services were resulting in women being less prepared for childbirth than they used to be.  \u0026ldquoPreviously, that article paraphrased Ms Jones as saying, \u0026ldquowomen would be shown around delivery rooms in the weeks before the birth but most maternity wards are now too busy.  But  the real story is that an overstretched and underfunded health service is failing to prepare women for childbirth, and that in turn is compounding their negative experience of birth, why did the narrative around the research universally become one of women terrying other women, creating an added burden for the NHS in the process? Why are we so keen to cast women as problematic rather than acknowledging they have valid stories to tell?  The obvious answer is that a media controlled by men at best fails to recognise, and at worst seeks to distort or ignore, narratives that have women and women\u0026rsquos experiences at their core. As at least some of the reports on Ms Jones\u0026rsquos comments were written by women, though, the truth is more troubling even than that, with a deep-seated societal refusal to hear women\u0026rsquos voices likely to blame.  Indeed, as has long been highlighted by the classicist Mary Beard \u0026ndash a scholar who endures endless misogynistic abuse because she tells the stories of the women airbrushed from history \u0026ndash even in the earliest written evidence of western culture \u0026ldquowomen\u0026rsquos voices are not being heard in the public sphere.  Yet the importance of hearing those voices cannot be overstated. While the unconditional support of my partner and wider family were crucial for my post-partum recovery, there is no way I\u0026rsquod have been able to come to terms with the birth experience, or get through the waking, the feeding, the worrying \u0026ndash the endless, endless worrying \u0026ndash without the company of complete strangers who at that very moment were going through exactly the same thing as me.  It was thanks to the many, many hours spent reading Mumsnet threads on everything from induction and labour to lochia and tongue-tie that I realised that everything I had just experienced was totally normal and I wasn\u0026rsquot someone for whom things had gone badly wrong. The psychological impact of that was profound.  Far from silencing women\u0026rsquos voices and ignoring the stories that have shaped their experience for centuries, we should be doing more to ensure those stories are heard. Only then can the actual cause of problems such as tocophobia be addressed and the horric can become less horrying. Websites like Mumsnet, which give women the opportunity to finally share their experiences in a public forum, are part of that solution."},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-review-benidorm-live-playhouse-edinburgh-four-stars","story":"  Benidorm Live  The Playhouse, Edinburgh  Neil Cooper, four stars  The sun looks like setting on the Solana Hotel at the start of Derren Litten\u0026rsquos end-of-the-pier adaptation of his phenomenally successful Brits-abroad sitcom.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo  only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Tuesday 18 Sep 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Tuesday 18 Sep 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusTuesday 18 Sep 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 18, 2018 at 10:12 amMV Earl Thorfinn is to undergo repairs, this week, following a mechanical failure onboard the North Isles vessel.

So we are asking the members of the community to vote for their Christmas lights.

Since then, the band has played at ious local venues supporting charities and community projects.On September 21, the BYOB charity dance from 7pm until 11pm will benefit the nearby Groam House Museum, an outstanding centre for Pictish and Celtic art.Tickets, which cost \u0026pound10 for adults and \u0026pound5 for children aged 16 and under \u0026ndash or \u0026pound25 for a family of four \u0026ndash may be bought in advance from Groam House Museum and Rosemarkie Spar shop or on the door on the night.The event is one of a series being organised by the volunteers of Groam House to raise funds for ongoing repairs and renewals following the rapid decline in Highland Council support.The unique display is focused on 15 carved Pictish stones which all originated in Rosemarkie, an important centre for early Christianity. The pride of the permanent display is the magnicent Rosemarkie cross slab, decorated with Pictish symbols and Christian crosses.Tuesday 18 Sep 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Eye-watering prices for replica strips and tickets, players who will readily roll around to feign injury, and corruption at the highest levels of the game. Twenty two millionaires chasing a white ball? No thanks, many people say.            But today we update on how football is actively changing lives one by one, by using its power with fans to encourage them to be healthier and stay healthier.The Football Fans in Training  initiative was first piloted eight years ago in a link-up between the SPFL Trust, the University of Glasgow and 13 professional clubs, with the goal of training men to help them achieve signicant weight loss.These are iniduals who would never be seen dead at Slimming World. But invite them to weekly exercise sessions at their favourite club and huge numbers will apply.Long-term research to be presented at Hampden Park today shows that it has worked not only in the short term, but these iniduals are keeping the weight off.Men also continued to be more active, ate increased amount of fruit and vegetables and improved their self-esteem during FFIT participation.             Such results prove that football can be an agent for real social change.Following its initial success with men in Scotland, the FFIT programme has now been taken up by professional football clubs in England and Germany, and has been modied for other sports like rugby union in England and New Zealand, Aussie rules football and ice hockey in Canada. Sport has a unique opportunity to reach out to Scotland’s communities in a way that nothing else can. We haven’t done enough with that potential but this is changing.Clubs like Hibernian, led by their pioneering chief executive Leeann Dempster, have developed a public social partnership with the aim of tackling social inequality and delivering positive health, learning and social outcomes.

It has also fired up my passion to bring about a real change and a radical rebalancing of power in the Scottish economy.            That’s why I was pleased to read two eagerly awaited reports on the future of the economy just published. The Institute for Public Policy Research’s  distinguished Commission on Economic Justice provides a radical and visionary plan for delivering change in a post-Brexit economy and the David Hume Institute’s  “Scotland’s Productivity Challenge” stimulates debate around a very practical agenda for change.            They complement and reinforce each other. Both reports serve as useful reminders of the importance of clarity in debate. The DHI report begins as it means to go on, “A country’s productivity is the single most important determinant of its average living standards and wealth.” The IPPR make a similar point “poor productivity ... holds back growth and holds down wages”.And both recognise the importance of long termism. So, the IPPR’s Commission notes that “the economy needs fundamental reform”, as the “weaknesses in productivity, investment and trade go back 30 years or more. They will not be addressed by incremental change or trying to ‘muddle through’.”This is refreshing. The challenges we face are deep-seated and they demand a new radicalism and vitality.There have, after all, been far-reaching changes to our economic structure over the last three decades. We have shted from being a nation of producers to being one of consumers. We have witnessed a continued contraction of manufacturing jobs and the total collapse of entire industries like mining.We have seen the emergence of a service-led economy and a consequent impact on our balance of trade and our national accounts, but also at a human level on working lives and the sustainability of local communities too.              : Richard Leonard: Mediocre SNP too timid to stand up to Tory austerityAnd we have seen a transformational loss of economic and industrial ownership and control from Scotland which has strained and broken accountability in our economy even further.Telling in the reports is an analysis that despite a high level of skills in the workforce and favourable terms of trade – we sell exports at relatively high prices compared to the imports we buy – our labour productivity and our labour force is being let down because we have low capital stock, that is we have low levels of business investment in machinery and equipment.Intriguingly, the IPPR conclude that low capital investment is exacerbated by the growth of the low-wage, precarious employment economic model. Business owners getting caught up in a downward business spiral of low pay, low investment, and low productivity.            Productivity in simple terms is measured as GDP per hour worked. The long hours culture is one of the reasons why both productivity and the quality of le is dragged down.One suggestion to tackle this is better parental leave entitlement and more holidays. I would not argue with this. But it is also long overdue that we revisit the UK opt-out of the European Union Working Time Directive, which means in Scotland alone more than a quarter of a million workers regularly work beyond a 48-hour week. We need to break away from this long hours’ culture, not only for the sake of our productivity, but also for the sake of our health, and health and safety.The answer to the productivity challenge and many other industrial questions from the political right is iniably tax cuts. But there is a sleight of hand here.Whilst the Tories have cut corporation tax from 26 pence to 19 pence, they have put up regressive taxes like VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent – hitting the poorest the hardest. So, there has been a redistribution of income and wealth, but just in the wrong direction.: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workers            Moreover, both reports eschew this tax-cutting agenda. The IPPR concludes “there is in fact little evidence that investment levels are signicantly influenced by corporation tax rates” – pointing to much higher rates in much more successful economies. The DHI’s finding is that the answer to Scotland’s productivity challenge is not to be found in tax cuts, but business research and development, investment in a stronger indigenous business base and better management.And they make clear that the Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance, including education, health, housing, planning, transport and economic development.At the start of this year, the Scottish Government published its assessment of Brexit’s effect on Scotland. Productivity was singled out as the largest factor in the reduction in our GDP, expected to contribute a 5.8 per cent drop in economic output.And there is little doubt that Brexit should inject some added urgency to tackle the long-term problem of Scotland’s productivity gap. It only serves to reinforce this need for a step change in how we do things. If we do not make this change in the context of Brexit, we will simply drt even further from the high-skill, high-wage economy Scotland needs. Increasing the level of productivity is key to achieving sustainable economic development, to raising incomes and to creating better quality jobs. Scotland is one of the better performing parts of the UK by measure of productivity, but it is still below the UK average. Much of the debate in the Scottish Parliament is regularly focused on what powers the current Government does not have rather than the ones that it does.The Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance. It is high time that at long last they were used.After all, the questions we now face are far too important to be left to economists alone to answer, and they certainly cannot be left to the present parties of government. If we are to bring about the real economic change we need, we will need to change our political priorities too.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801443.1537253498!/image/image.jpg","title":"independence eight times more damaging than brexit unionists say","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Independence would be eight times as costly to the Scottish economy as Brexit, campaigners against a second independence referendum have warned on the fourth anniversary of Scotland\u0026#8217s decision on its constitutional future.                Scottish Business UK, a cross-party campaign set up to represent pro-business Unionist voices, warned that the damage to trade with the rest of the UK would outstrip losses from exiting the European single market under the government’s Brexit plans, and said employers would struggle under the weight of added uncertainty.            In a report published today entitled ‘Win-Win: the business case for Scotland’s place in the UK’, campaigners claim that Scottish independence would be eight times as costly as the Scottish Government’s worst Brexit forecasts, because Scotland would lose the additional government spending per head under the Barnett Formula.            The report also highlights figures showing trade between Scotland the rest of the UK is worth three times as much to the Scottish economy as trade with the EU. The SNP called the warning “ludicrous”.Scottish Business UK founder Robert Kilgour, an investor and former care home operator, said: “Scottish businesses and the economy has gone through an extended period of uncertainty and that is destabilising our opportunity to grow and crucially to secure inward investment.“The negative impact of the continuing uncertainty is a message I hear regularly from investors who turn to other countries or regions in England, to give their investments a more stable base from which to grow.”Former Conservative MEP Struan Stevenson, the campaign group’s chief executive, added: “We are four years from the last referendum on independence for Scotland which was not supported, yet the spectre of a further referendum remains ever present. “We’re calling on the Scottish Government to abandon the demand for another referendum and focus more on reigniting the Scottish economy, so we once again become a credible investment opportunity, on a par with other parts of the UK.”            Scottish Labour’s Economy spokesperson Jackie Baillie MSP said: “This is yet more evidence of how damaging independence would be to our economy. As the SNP itself admitted in its cuts commission, independence would mean decades of austerity, tax rises and massive reductions in public spending.“Nicola Sturgeon needs to stop putting nationalism before the NHS, schools and jobs. She should drop her plans for an unwanted second independence referendum and instead try and start fixing the mess she has made of the economy and our schools and hospitals.”An SNP spokesperson described the claims as “ludicrously over the top”.“They show just how rattled the Tories are – they know support for independence has never been so consistently high or sustained, and that Brexit may well be the point of no ,” the spokesperson said.            “Leaving the EU and a single market eight times bigger than the UK’s alone threatens to be disastrous for Scotland – and the shambolic no-deal outcome the Tories are now preparing for would be utterly catastrophic.”Meanwhile, Scotland’s minister in charge of Brexit negotiations has warned of the growing risk the UK will be forced into a “chaotic, blind Brexit”.Constitution Secretary Mike Russell accused Theresa May of “misleading” voters on the prospects for her Chequers plan, claiming EU leaders have already dismissed the UK government’s proposals.And he claimed politicians south of the Border had failed to meet their pledge that Scotland would be an “equal partner”  it stayed in the Union.Mr Russell said the Prime Minister must use a summit of EU leaders in Salzburg this week to “rule out both a ‘blind’ and a No-deal Brexit”.            Speaking ahead of an address to business leaders and academics in Edinburgh, Mr Russell said: “Four years ago today, the people of Scotland voted on our nation’s future and were then told we were to be treated as equal partners in the UK – absolutely nothing that has happened since has lived up to that pledge, with Brexit making it clearer by the day that Westminster is incapable of working in Scotland’s national interests.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801419.1537213811!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis don t think mps won t do the unthinkable","story":"        Ten years ago this month, the collapse of Lehman Brothers transformed our world.                There was a foretaste in the UK with the run on Northern Rock, but it was the US investment giant’s fall in 2008 that heralded the start of the Great Recession.            We’re still working out the ways that moment cascaded through all our lives. The impact could be so great as to be measured demographically – studies suggest there are 4.8 million fewer children in the United States, with the economic crisis forcing young people to put off the decision to have a family - sometimes indefinitely.            In purely economic terms, too, the effects are still being felt: those aged between 30 and 39 earned on average £2,000 less per year between 2008 and 2017.And then there are the effects that are less easy to measure: a generation  that feels less secure and is less confident that the world can provide a path for them - but more determined, perhaps, to find their own way.The most interesting analyses of the ten-year milestone have been the ones that have gone back to that moment, to see how it was reported and commented on at the time.One such exercise reminded me of a detail that offers a worthwhile lesson among all the other lessons, not about our economy and society, but our politics.In September 2008, in the teeth of the crisis, when it looked as  global financial institutions would topple like dominoes, the US congress actually voted against President Bush’s initial proposal for a 700bn bailout of the nine biggest American banks.            A single vote wiped 1.2tn off the value of the world stock market, in an hour. For good and for ill, the scheme was eventually revised and passed, but for a while, at least, politicians were pushed by fear of their constituents to step off the edge into the unknown.There is an assumption that MPs would never vote down the Brexit deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels, whatever it is, because the alternative is so stark.The tenth anniversary of Lehman’s collapse is a reminder that politicians are quite capable of creating the conditions for disaster - and of doing the unthinkable in response.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801503.1537259243!/image/image.jpg","title":"storm ali new storm set to blast scotland a day after helene","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit.

constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew

Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Learn to Swim Programme , learners will be provided with a more exciting learn to swim programme that is supported with a range of badges and certicates.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn.

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

It’s always good craic, but our Cadets also put in some serious work, learning something new every week and stretching themselves with training that can lead to respected accreditations.  Acquiring those new skills – whether that’s a BTEC in Public Services or how to abseil off a clf – creates a real sense of achievement.  Importantly, it also gives our Cadets something signicant to put on their Personal Statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs and everyone comes away feeling positive about themselves.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“No-one can be good at everything, but we believe that everyone can be good at something and our hugely committed Adult Instructors make sure that every one of the Cadets under their care has the encouragement and opportunity to shine.”\n\nTeens from Cadet Detachments across County Antrim are already getting behind the membership campaign, preparing to welcome newcomers. \n\nCadet Sergeant Yasmin Andrews, who currently serves as her Majesty’s Lord Lieutenant’s Cadet for the County of Antrim, says, “We all know how much you can get out of being a Cadet, but we also know that it can be awkward to walk into somewhere new, knowing no-one.  Hopefully anyone coming along to check out our Detachment will see how friendly we all are and will feel welcome. … it’s up to us to persuade them to give Cadets a try!\n\n“We get to do the sort of outdoor stuff that can cost a fortune  you try to go it alone - mountain biking, climbing, marksmanship, abseiling and kayaking, plus we can do the Duke of Edinburgh Awards, work towards BTECs and we get the chance to go on Camp every year. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDromore Cadet Daniel Hooke agrees.  He says, “There’s so much happening that there really is something for everyone.  Most people find something they really enjoy and do well at but, even  you aren’t great at a particular activity, it’s always good craic having a go!”\n\nColonel McCammond adds, “Parents naturally want to give their children as many opportunities as possible but there have to be limits to withdrawals from the Bank of Mum \u0026amp Dad!  A key benefit of the cadet movement therefore is that all our activities are affordable or, even better, totally free … even the unorms are free all kids pay for is their footwear.\n\n“Cadet membership is open to boys and girls from age 12 to 18 and, right now, local Detachments are encouraging potential new members to come along and see for themselves what the Cadet movement has to offer. The earlier you join the more time you have to fit in all the experiences, but people shouldn’t be put off by the idea that they’ve maybe left it too late.

Certainly, for most people, there will be a Detachment within easy reach, and we are hoping that we’ll see plenty of potential new members coming along to check us out, without any obligation to make a commitment. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Mums and dads are welcome to come along too, to see what the kids are getting involved with … and we’re hopeful that we may even be able to persuade some intrepid parents to consider working with us as Adult Volunteers!

welcomes speed limit at local schools","story":"\nThe Department for Infrastructure has introduced a new part-time speed limit of 20 mph outside seven rural primary schools including Bronte Primary School, Ballynaskeagh Road, Banbridge.\n\n                \nIntroduced last Tuesday, the new legislation will reduce the National Speed Limit to 20 mph for a short time at the start and end of the school day when pupils are arriving in the morning and leaving school in the afternoon. This will be for a distance of 400-500 metres along adjacent roads in the vicinity of each school and will be enforceable by the PSNI.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMotorists should be aware of, and adhere to, the new arrangements in the vicinity of these schools. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nLighting on the signs  will advise motorists when the speed limit is in effect. These signs will remain off for most of the time but will light up at the start and end of the school day.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Installation of the required signage and lighting will be complete on or shortly after September 18.\n\nWelcoming the news, the Ulster Farmers’ Union urged motorists to ‘take these seriously’. \n\nUFU’s rural affairs chairperson, Joy Rollston said “This is an important step in helping reduce the number of collisions and causalities on our roads.  \n\n“Schools are busy places, especially when children are dropped off and collected. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The Department deserves credit for listening to concerns raised by the UFU and others about the dangers on often fast rural roads. \n\n“Implementing and policing part-time speed limits will help keep children safe. We would urge all motorists to take these seriously – doing so could save a child’s le.”\n\nMrs Rollston added that the UFU would like to see this extended to all rural primary schools as quickly as possible. New signage and lighting will be erected in the vicinity of the seven schools to warn motorists when the 20mph speed limit is operational. It will be enforced by the PSNI.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"celebrating irish language","story":"\n\nNOMINATIONS\n are still open for The Outstanding Contribution to the Irish Language Award in this year’s Aisling Awards.\n\nThis award celebrates the vibrancy and uniqueness which the Irish language brings to the city of Belfast, the award will honour an organisation or person who works tirelessly to pioneer the language.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal.

It’s here that Terri meets his we Ruth, played by West End star Niamh Perry, and the two try to build their le together, as Terri becomes distracted – all too easily – by trying to passionately promote the latest band to come on the punk scene as he turns promoter for Rudi and The Outcasts.\nIf anyone during Sunday’s afternoon matinee was expecting a leisurely retrospective they were in for a rude awakening as this is a gloriously full-on production of music and song with all-star cast in full, fine voice, all playing instruments and giving it the heap.\nEvery audience member is with our protagonist as he goes across the water, copious copies of seven-inch vinyl under his arm as he tries, most of the time in vain, to try and get snooty English music executives to listen to a band from Derry called The Undertones and their debut song Teenage Kicks – a song so iconic that John Peel did the unthinkable and played it twice on Radio One.\nWith every high comes the inevitable low and we witness how Terri releases the band from the Good Vibrations label for “£500 and a signed copy of a Shangri-Las record”.\nWith a marriage falling apart, mounting debts at the record shop and next to no revenue, a fundraising concert at the Ulster Hall sets the scene for the rousing finale and our lead’s poignant rendition of Sonny Bono’s Laugh At Me.\nA standing ovation gave way to the ‘national anthem’ as the raw opening bars of Teenage Kicks started up and the audience sang every line back to the cast.\nGood Vibrations is a must-see – simple as that. The amount of energy fizzing off the stage is infectious and the cast of ten are exceptional. A transfer to the West End must surely follow.\n\n\nGood Vibrations runs at the Lyric Theatre until Saturday, October 6.

deal or no deal\". \n\nHe said: \"In March the EU produced a draft legal text on the backstop that would see Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the UK.\n\n\"While the Government quite rightly ruled out such a suggestion immediately, it is worrying that this interpretation of the December agreement by the EU was allowed to take hold.\"\n\nSDLP MLA Claire Hanna accused Mr Johnson of displaying the \"little Englander mindset that is causing the ultimate act of political, social and economic self-harm across these islands\".\n"},{"url":null,"title":"jolene bunting suspended from belfast city council","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Jolene Bunting has been suspended from Belfast City Council for four months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nShe has been suspended while an investigation into complaints against her are carried out. \n\nCouncillor Bunting is currently under investigation for breaches of the Northern Ireland Local Government Code of Conduct for Councillors.\n\nShe is being investigated for her behaviour towards other people, bringing the council into disrepute, her responsibility under equality legalisation, her use of councillor position and use of council resources.\n\nThe decision comes after an Interim Adjudication Hearing held at the Resolution Centre in Belfast on September 4.\n\nBetween December 2017 and August 2018 14 complaints were made against Councillor Bunting. \n\nA number of people raised complaints against her including Belfast City Council Chief Executive Suzanne Wylie, Lord Mayor Deidre Hargey, Deputy Lord Mayor Emmett McDonough-Brown and other councillors.  \n\nOne complaint was signed by 87 complainants while another was signed by 79 members of the public. \n\nAt the hearing Acting Commissioner Ian Gordon found that Councillor Bunting has failed to comply with the Local Government Code of Conduct.\n\nMr Gordon found that a member of the public, knowing all the relevant facts would consider that her conduct has brought her position as a councillor and the council into disrepute. \n\nHe determined that there has been continuing damage to the council\u0027s reputation due to Councillor Bunting\u0027s failure to adhere to the cocde of conduct and that her behaviour and subsequent publicity is likely to have negatively impacted public confidence.\n\nThe Acting Commissioner decided to suspend her during the investigating due to the \"frequent, ongoing repetitive and escalating nature of the alleged breaches of the Code\".\n\nComplaints against Councillor Bunting were made a result of her \"public statements in relation to the Islamic religion, her association with the far-right group Britain First and the publication of a meme on social media\".\n\nIn her defence Councillor Bunting said that her association with Britain First was to \"encourage it to become more moderate and to improve its structure\".\n\nMr Gordon ruled that maintaining public confidence outweighed the personal and financial impact on Councillor Bunting. \n\nA full hearing into Councillor Bunting\u0027s conduct will be held at a later date and in the interim she has the right to appeal the Acting Commissioner\u0027s decision to the High Court. \n\nPosting on her social media accounts Councillor Bunting said that she \"will continue to tell the truth and no one will silence me\".\n\nCouncillor Bunting was originally elected as TUV councillor for the Court ward but currently serves as an independent councillor.\n\nShe has attracted controversy due to her links to the far-right group Britain First, appearing with leaders Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen at rallies in Belfast.\n\nFransen caused a stir in January when she gave a speech from the Lord Mayor\u0027s Chair at Belfast City Hall, while on a tour of the facility with Councillor Bunting.\n\nFollowing a falling out she is no longer associated with the extremist far-right group.\n\nCouncillor Bunting also faced criticism after a Tweet in May mentioning the Famine in Ireland featuring a cartoon frog meme popular amongst right-wing groups and trolls.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

I want to take a few minutes to explain what the government has agreed, and what this means for us leaving the EU. \nhttps:t.co/T96i09mUYx\n \npic.twitter/rCswFBlHAc\n\n— Theresa May  \nSeptember 17, 2018\n\n\n\n\nSetting out the UK’s hopes, Mr Raab said the Salzburg meeting at which Mrs May is expected to briefly set out her position over dinner on Wednesday night before her 27 counterparts consider the situation in her absence on Thursday, would be “an important milestone” and “a stepping stone” to a deal.\n\nBut he made clear the UK was looking for further movement from the EU on the Irish border.\n\nHe branded Mr Barnier’s “backstop” proposals – which would see Northern Ireland remain in the EU customs area – unworkable, because they would create a border in the Irish Sea and fail to respect the constitutional integrity of the UK.\n\n“What I’m not going to do is to say that I would refuse to entertain any further proposals that the EU comes up with but they’ve got to be respecting the equities that we’ve set out,” he told correspondents from European newspapers including Germany’s Die Welt, France’s Le Monde and the .\n\nIn a high-profile Panorama interview on Monday, Mrs May framed the decision facing the country as a choice between her deal or no deal.\n\nBut with large numbers of Tory hard Brexiteers openly rejecting the Chequers plan, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the scene was set for a second referendum.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nSir Vince Cable said Brexit would provide hard-right Tories with an ‘erotic spasm’ \n\n\n\n\nSir Vince told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “I think growing numbers of people – we are already seeing it from senior Labour people and a few Conservatives – will say that the only way forward is to take this back to the public and say: ‘Do you accept what Theresa May has negotiated or would you rather stay in the European Union?\u0027”\n\nA demonstration at the Labour conference in Liverpool on Sunday will add to pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to throw his weight behind calls for a second referendum.\n\nBut Mr Raab rejected talk of a second vote, saying: “Even  that’s what people want to do, it’s dficult to see how it could be done in time, and we wouldn’t facilitate it.”\n\nEuropean Council president Donald Tusk said he wanted to avoid the “catastrophe” of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIn a letter to EU leaders he said they should discuss arrangements for the “final phase” of the Brexit talks “including the possibility of calling another European Council in November”.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nMr Tusk said he is hopeful that catastrophe can be avoided \n\n\n\n\nHe said the EU leaders should also reconfirm the need for a “legally operational backstop” on Ireland to avoid a hard border.\n\nMr Tusk added that leaders should work on “limiting the damage” caused by Brexit.\n\n“Unfortunately, a no-deal scenario is still quite possible. But  we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe.”\n\nMeanwhile a Government-commissioned report recommended that EU migrants should not be given any preferential treatment after Brexit.\n\nThe long-awaited study by the Migration Advisory Committee  also concluded that the post-Brexit immigration system should make it easier for higher-skilled workers to come to the country, while continuing to limit access for those in lower-skilled roles.\n\nMAC chairman Professor Alan Manning said: “If – and this is not an MAC recommendation – immigration is not to be part of the negotiations with the EU and the UK is deciding its future migration system in isolation, we recommend moving to a system in which all migration is managed with no preferential access to EU citizens.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"report on future of irish policing set to be unveiled","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

report detailing the future of policing in Ireland is to be published on Tuesday amid calls for serious reform within the force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which is issuing the report, is headed by chair Kathleen O’Toole and was established by the government in May 2017 to develop a blueprint for the future of the service.\n\nThe commission has been tasked with undertaking an independent examination of all aspects of policing in Ireland, including all s currently carried out by An Garda Siochana as well as ersity in recruitment, appropriate leadership capacity and the culture of policing in Ireland.\n\nTheir terms of reference state that they plan to pursue a greater sense of accountability within the force.\n\n“An Garda Siochana has been the subject of signicant public controversy over the past decade and continues to be so,” the commission says.\n\n“Concerns remain in relation to the accountability of An Garda Siochana, its leadership and management capacity, and its culture and ethos.”\n\nAccording to new Commissioner Drew Harris, the reform of An Garda Siochana will not be on the same scale as the RUC’s transition to the PSNI.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nDrew Harris said he wanted to improve Gardai systems \n\n\n\n\nMr Harris – who was deputy chief constable of the PSNI and a senior officer in the RUC before taking the Garda top job – said he believed the public had more trust in frontline gardai than in senior management.\n\nAn Garda Siochana has come under intense scrutiny in the last year and has been labelled as in dire need of reform.\n\nFalse breath test figures, missing homicide data, issues with finances at Templemore training college and the pending outcome of the Disclosures Tribunal are all issues facing Mr Harris and the force.\n\nA survey published in May at the annual conference of the Garda Representative Association showed that one in six frontline gardai may be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nSeven gardai took their own lives in the past year.\n\nPsychologist Dr Finian Fallon also determined that a further 11% of the force had what he called “sub-threshold” PTSD, based on a survey in which more than 2,200 gardai responded to a questionnaire.\n\nThe report also says 27% may be “walking wounded” from trauma.\n\nThey cited a number of reasons for stress, including frustration at the amount of paperwork, lack of appropriate equipment to carry out the job properly and a breakdown in relationship between senior officers and rank-and-file gardai.\n\nMany claimed they had insufficient training on the technical skills required and the overall remuneration package was inadequate, as well as exhaustion and unsociable hours adding to further dissatisfaction.\n\nIn his first speech in the role, Mr Harris pledged to deliver to the highest possible operational and ethical standards, improve Gardai systems, processes and training.\n\nIn an apparent reference to the treatment of whistleblowers, he also claimed that he will be more open to concerns raised both internally and externally.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kopparberg to produce cider in uk due to brexit jitters","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

In July, the British Retail Consortium said that failure to reach a deal could leave food “rotting at ports”.\n\nAny cider made under the brand’s name in the UK would be the first to be produced outside of Sweden. The brewery’s origins in the Swedish town of Kopparberg date back to 1882.\n\nIt was re-established in 1994 by brothers Peter and Dan-Anders Bronsman. Kopparberg Cider, known for its sweet taste and range of flavours, is now available in over 30 countries.\n\nIn the UK, Kopparberg is one of the top-selling ciders at pubs and bars, served at more than 30,000 venues around the country.\n\nJD Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin has previously indicated that he has received assurances from Kopparberg that it would transfer some production to the UK.\n\nMr Martin, an outspoken Brexit supporter, has led the removal of several EU-made products from the Wetherspoon’s menu to be replaced with British or non-EU alternatives.\n\nBut Kopparberg has kept its place on the bar despite being made in Sweden.\n\n“Our biggest bottled cider supplier is the excellent Kopparberg of Sweden,” Mr Martin said in June.\n\n“Kopparberg has said that it will transfer production to the UK post-Brexit.”\n\nKopparberg declined to comment.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"11 massive dramas going on in small towns","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

their five-wicket win over Sussex in the T20 Blast final on Saturday, the Pears were back in action on Tuesday morning in a County Championship match against Essex.\n\nAnd it didn’t quite go to plan as they quickly slipped to 32 for six – including this doozy of a dismissal.\n\n\n3⃣ ... 😬🙈\n#ESSvWOR\n \npic.twitter/iDa5LuHUTx\n\n— Essex Cricket  \nSeptember 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a passage of play that nobody comes out of particularly well, with both Worcestershire batsmen ending up at the same end as Olly Westbury disagreed with Joe Clarke about whether or not a third run was there for the taking.\n\nBut as Westbury stood his ground at the non-striker’s end, Essex bowler Jamie Porter collected a throw from the deep and lobbed the ball waywardly in the vague direction of wicketkeeper Adam Wheater.\n\nSo bad was Porter’s throw that Westbury probably would have had time to make his ground twice over, aided by a fumble from Wheater, but he remained stock still before trudging back to the dressing room as the bails were removed.\n\n\nI’m not sure we can credit Ports with that run out...his throw was heading for the boundary!\n— Mark Wallis  \nSeptember 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nA moment to forget for pretty much everyone concerned.\n\nWorcestershire, who were bowled out for 94 before lunch, entered the match bottom of Division One with two games to play and desperately needing a win to

Because of that, the regional political situation has been stabilised and more progress is expected,” Mr Kim said, according to South Korean media pool reports.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump, stands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Sentosa Island in Singapore \n\n\n\n\nMr Moon responded by expressing his own thanks to Mr Kim for making a “bold decision” in a New Year’s speech to open a new era of detente and send a delegation to the South Korean Winter Olympics in February.\n\nThe results of the talks were not immediately available. Seoul officials earlier said they would focus on how to achieve denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, decrease military tensions along their border and improve overall ties. \n\nThe North’s media said the talks would reaffirm their commitment to Korean peace, unity and prosperity.\n\nDuring a conversation at the Paekhwawon guest house where Mr Moon was to stay, Mr Kim said North Koreans hope diplomacy will yield positive results. \n\n“I think it was our people’s wish that we come up with good results as fast as we can,” Mr Kim said, according to the media pool reports.\n\nMr Moon responded that “Our hearts are fluttering, but at the same we have heavy hearts,” and added, “We have built trust and friendship between us, so I think all will be well.”\n\nThe two are to meet again on Wednesday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"renaultnissan teams with google for android in dashboards","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The drainage work was completed recently, but the road is to be closed again between September 17 and 28 from 9am to 4.30pm daily. It will be open at weekends.\n\nLocal councillor Dermot Curran has expressed concern that motorists and visitors to the area face more disruption and believes the resurfacing work should have been completed during the recent road closures.\n\nHe plans to contact the Department for Infrastructure to ensure the resurfacing work can be completed as soon as possible.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main road linking Downpatrick and Ardglass carries a high volume of traffic, with a lot of this associated with the village\u0026rsquos fishing industry. These road closures are disruptive and I am disappointed the drainage upgrade and resurfacing work was not completed at the same time, continued Cllr Curran.\n\n\u0026ldquoI am fully supportive of the much-needed investment along this particular route, but feel the timing of the work to minimise road closures and disruption could have been handled better.\n\nAlso this week, Cllr Curran has revealed a similar situation has arisen on the Strangford side of Ardglass where a road was closed recently as part of planned improvements.\n\nA section of the road linking the village with Chapeltown was closed in mid-July to upgrade drainage systems and is now closed again. Resurfacing work is also proposed but there is no confirmation when this will start.\n\nCllr Curran added: \u0026ldquoAll road improvement work across the district is welcome and roads officials deserve praise for their commitment to address routes which require investment.

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg. The six semi-finals will be played over the weekend of September 28-30.\n\nMeanwhile, Portaferry and Ballygalget lock horns on Saturday in a bid to join Ballycran in the Senior Hurling Championship decider.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

Both rings are decorated.\n\nThe broken ring\u0026rsquos surface is ided into a number of panels, some with a cross-style mot. The decoration, though not as accomplished as on other examples, does compare with similar patterns which experts suggest characterise a series of silver rings of 12th-century date from both Ireland and Britain.\n\nThe intact rings decoration includes a flower pattern and traces of lettering which may read a version of \u0026lsquoIESU REX EXAUDI NOS\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash \u0026lsquoJesus, king, hear us\u0026rsquo, but this is not certain.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe nature of the lettering, which is termed Lombardic, suggests the 13th or 14th century while the style of the ring overall is consistent with this date. As the two rings from Bright dfer little from each other in date, it is assumed they were lost or deposited together at the same time.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are of interest in illustrating the range of finger rings being worn in east Ulster in the late middle ages and might have been made locally or imported.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe ruins of Bright Castle, believed to have been built between the 15th and 16th century, are close by and may have been built on an earlier settlement. If the rings were in circulation for a reasonable  of time it is even possible that they could have been owned and eventually lost by the castle\u0026rsquos occupants.\n\nMeanwhile, a fragment of Viking \u0026lsquohack silver\u0026rsquo, dating back to the ninth or 10th century, has been discovered near Drumbo.\n\nExperts say the piece, which is less than 2cm in , would originally have been part of a larger item such as an arm ring or bracelet.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Scientist elected as international council member  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA CARRYDUFF scientist has been awarded membership of a prestigious international body for food science and technology.\n\nProfessor Margaret Patterson has been elected as one of the seven council members of the International Union of Food Science and Technology .\n\nIUFoST represents more than 150,000 food scientists and technologists in over 60 countries throughout the world.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

Several keynote speakers took to the stage to deliver short presentations aimed at helping farmers to encompass the breeding, nutrition and health needs of the industry.\n  The seminar sessions included short presentations by Dr Francis Lively, AFBI William Minchin, MSD Animal Health and Paul Elwood, HVS Animal Health.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

of a minor speech impediment.\n\n                \nOn Sunday Jamie Bryson engaged in a debate with Alliance members on Twitter, claiming her party is now adopting  nationalist positions.\n\n\n   \n

           \n            \n\nHe tweeted: “Pan-nationalism = #StandardLong” to which Naomi Long responded that there are “cockatoos with a wider repertoire of phrases”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnother Tweeter then interjected with a comical image of Gerry Adams, asking: “Did someone say Radical Republican Agenda?” \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nBut a further poster emphasised the point with a further tweet, perhaps suggesting that the subtle jag against Mr Bryson had not been picked up. \n\n“Wadical wepublican agenda??” he asked, in reference to Mr Bryson’s minor speech impediment.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nA screen grab of Naomi Long\u0027s \u0027like\u0027 for a tweet ridiculing Jamie Bryson\u0027s speech

Twitter labelled his son a ‘b*****d’ he also questioned her responses. At that time she said: “...Not your son’s fault you are his dad.”\n\nAsked by Mr Bryson then  she was comparing the abuse of his son with his opposition to same sex marriage, she replied: “I’m saying don’t attack the personal lives of others and expect yours to be off limits...”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nAlliance Leader Naomi Long said she had not seen the Tweet and had liked it accidentally.\u0027Pic Colm Lenaghan/Pacemaker\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nHe said yesterday: “There appears to be a pattern whereby Naomi engages in a Twitter debate then a whole host of nationalist and liberal trolls pile in behind her. \n\n“What is rather bizarre is you will find Naomi feels the need to ‘like’ every single tweet from them. This is water of a duck’s back to me, but I think a public apology would be appropriate, more so for the countless people who actually do have serious speech impediments.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBut Mrs Long said she had never seen the Tweet about his speech impediment.\n\n“I didn’t like that Tweet,” she said. “I must have hit it when I was scrolling down. It is just a complete accident because I did not even see the tweet that I was supposed to have liked. \n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJamie Bryson said he was not surprised that Naomi Long had linked the tweet about his speech impediment.

I am actually quite shocked that anyone would think that I would.”\n\nShe added: “I have deleted it now. It happens... It is just not who I am.”\n\nBut the British Stammering Association said Mrs Long should apologise to Mr Bryson in order to offer reassurance to others who may be seriously incapacitated with speech impediments.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBSA Chief Executive Jane Powell said: “It is pretty sad, really. Stammering is one of the few disabilities that it is still considered acceptable to ridicule.\n\n“Stammering is a disability people can make fun of in a way that it is no longer acceptable to do for other disabilities, for example  someone is in a wheelchair or blind.”\n\nThere are quite a wide range of types of stammering, for some people it can be quite extreme but for others it is less so, she said.\n\n“But either way some people think sufferers should just get a grip and speak properly. \n\n“But it is pretty sad for persons to make jokes about when they won’t ridicule someone for their height or weight or skin colour.”\n\nStammering is often heredity and has a neurological cause, she said.\n\nWhen told Mrs Long said she had accidentally like the remark, she added: “Then they should apologise for inadvertently causing offence.\n\n“Having a speech impediment can literally cause people to stay indoors and choose work and employment that prevents them from mixing with others. It can have a dramatic impact on their lives.” \n\n“People don’t yet see stammering as being an issue, but some iniduals can have real dficulty in saying their own name or ordering a meal.”\n\nShe welcomed that Mrs Long ‘unliked’ the Tweet. The target of such ridicule may shrug it off, she accepts.\n\n“But it sends out a signal that it is okay to bully people - and that others with stammers who are looking on need to watch out because their stammer is equally open to ridicule. \n\n“This is why an apology is in order. How hard can that be?”\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n                      \n\n

completion of a long-awaited transfer of 59 former Ministry of Defence  homes in Lisburn to a housing association.\n\n                \nMore than 250 residents of the Mountview Drive and Skyline Drive areas of the city have signed a petition calling on Karen Bradley to intervene in order to kick-start the process, which has been stalled by the impasse at Stormont.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA business case for the transfer of the disused properties – formerly Army accommodation that was declared surplus to requirements by the MoD and transferred to the Department for Communities in January 2017 – was approved months ago, but the handover still hasn’t taken place. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClanmil Housing Group, supported by local politicians, has been trying to secure the transfer of the houses – thought to be worth around £5 million – for well over a year. \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIt plans to refurbish the properties, many of which have been vandalised or fallen into disrepair, and bring them back into use as social and affordable housing.\n\nIn June, the Department for Communities said it was considering how it could proceed with the transfer, without the approval of a Stormont minister.\n\nWith the process still not complete, disgruntled residents of the area are urging Karen Bradley to intervene.\n\nLocal resident Sophie Bagguley, who organised the petition, said: “The community has rallied behind this call on the secretary of state to act now so that these homes can be made available for occupation. There are young people desperate to be housed in their local community and it is unacceptable that these properties can’t be occupied because we don’t have a government to take that decision.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nLagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who will pass the petition on to Mrs Bradley, said it was “a shame” that the houses were being allowed to lie vacant when so many people need housing.\n\n“I will be urging the NIO to include this type of decision within the scope of the legislation to be introduced in the absence of a ing Assembly. It is important for the transfer of these houses to be approved as soon as possible,” he said.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n

here\u0027s what we know so far.\n                \n\nIs there a weather warning in place for Storm Ali?\n\nYes. The original yellow status severe weather warning has been upgraded to amber. The warning is valid throughout Northern Ireland from 8:00am to 5:00pm on Wednesday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\nWhat does an amber weather warning from the Met Office actually mean?\n\nThere is an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, which could potentially disrupt your plans.\n\nThis means there is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures, power cuts and the potential risk to le and property.\n\nYou should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property.\n\nYou may want to consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\nWhat should I expect when Storm Ali arrives?\n\nThe following is a list of what to expect issued by the Met Office:\n\n- Flying debris is likely and could lead to Injuries or danger to le\n\n- Probably some damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs or damage through falling trees and branches breaking\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n- Longer journey times and cancellations likely, as road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected\n\n- Power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage\n\n- Some roads and bridges likely to close\n\n- Large waves could affect coastal roads, sea fronts and properties\n\n\nWhy is the storm called Ali?\n\nThe Met Office officially named the storm, Ali on Tuesday morning.\n\nLast week, the Met Office and Met
