I could just see what looked like a little crisp packet sticking out of a bank in the sand.\u0027I pulled it out and just thought I\u0027d have a quick look and see when this crisp packet was used. I looked at the back of it and saw the date was from 2006.          The snack had an expiry date of December 1999 making its packaging more than 19 years old          He also found an empty packet of Walkers cheese and onion which went out of date in December 2006Beach walker, 42, is stunned to find Golden Wonder crisp...Empty crisp packets can finally be recycled from today, as...Pregnant newlywed is jailed for two months for opening a...Share this article\u0027The second packet I found, the Golden Wonder Wheat Crunchies, was on the exact same beach clean and dated back to 1999.\u0027He added: \u0027I would urge people to always try to reduce the amount that we use.\u0027The key to getting any kind of litter message out there is using the reduce, reuse recycle motto. If we don\u0027t need it, don\u0027t use it.\u0027For example, people are still going to eat crisps but if you\u0027re going to take them for your lunch, get a bigger bag and put some into a smaller, reusable tub rather than buying a multipack where you get one big bag with seven or eight smaller bags in it.\u0027Additionally, if you do have wrappers from your food, make sure it gets put into a litter bin.          Mr Legg is urging members of the public to mindful of dropping their litter and how they can go about reducing the amount of rubbish produced\u0027I\u0027d also urge people to see if there is a recycling scheme.\u0027Walkers crisps have very recently started a crisp packet recycling scheme although there aren\u0027t many drop off points in Scotland yet.\u0027But hopefully if we keep asking, they\u0027ll bring in more locations.\u0027Crisp packets can take up to 80 years to compose.The next beach clean-up arranged by the FCCT will take place at the West Sands January 19. The packets are not the only ancient snacks to be found on British beaches. Earlier this year, Neil McDonald, 42, found a ready salted crisp packet on Gullane beach in East Lothian dating back to 1967. And Laurence Miller, 10, was volunteering in a litter picking group at Treyarnon Bay, in Padstow, Cornwall when he found a 30-year-old packet of cheese and onion flavoured crisps.           Neil McDonald found the Golden Wonder crisp packet while doing a cleanup on Gullane beach in East Lothian          Laurence Miller, 10, was volunteering in a litter picking group at Treyarnon Bay, in Padstow, Cornwall when he found the packet of cheese and onion flavoured crisps washed up ashore"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/31/07/04E43244000003E8-0-image-m-6_1546241525207.jpg","title":"Theresa promises new chapter New Year message","story":"    Mrs May said during her New Year address that 2019 would mark a \u0027new chapter\u0027 for BritainMrs Leadsom, who was a leading pro-Leave figure in the referendum campaign, said the agreement hammered out with Brussels delivered on the 2016 vote.In an article for the Daily Mail, right, she challenged fellow Eurosceptic Tory MPs to get behind the policy or risk renewed calls for a second referendum, which she pledged to \u0027fight tooth and nail\u0027. The Leader of the House said: \u0027We can come together to support this deal, or we can throw the negotiations back into limbo and undermine our democracy.\u0027Should that happen, I know many will be demanding a second referendum andor an extension to Article 50.\u0027I will fight tooth and nail against any such outcome.

Famous womaniser was...Share this articleEveryone was guaranteed a prize, but at a hefty ten shillings tickets were way out of reach for ordinary citizens. The sparkling prizes were printed on garish advertisement posters put up across the land (pictured left, c.1566). Elizabeth\u0027s lottery was a way to raise money without going to Parliament (seen right in a 1559 woodcut)          This advertisement, issued c.1566, outlines how the lottery will work. This includes a list of the prizes (the prices in Tudor spelling). There would be a jackpot of £5,000 (around £850,000 in today\u0027s money) and expenses tableware for the runners-up. In the end the value of the prizes was reduced when only 10 percent of the tickets were soldThere was another even more pressing reason for Elizabeth to feel threatened. Her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, was a Catholic with a strong claim to the English throne. Forced to abdicate the Scottish throne, the plucky Mary fled across the border in 1568. She was imprisoned but continued to inspire plots from Elizabeth’s foreign and domestic enemies.There was yet another drain on the treasury: England\u0027s status as a burgeoning imperial power. Opening up new trade routes required new expensive ships, as did the voyages of discovery that would enjoy their crowning moment in 1580 with Sir Francis Drake\u0027s successful circumnavigation of the earth.With all these demands on the royal coffers it’s no surprise Elizabeth\u0027s secretary of state, Sir William Cecil, complained that a lack of money was \u0027the principal sickness in this Court\u0027.Raising taxes would spark the ire of Parliament, so a lottery seemed the ideal solution.The initiative wasn\u0027t going to pull in a quick buck, however, as there were a whole three years before it being announced and the draw actually being held in 1569.Shivering against the winter cold, ticket holders gathered by St Paul\u0027s Cathedral in London accompanied by a beer-guzzling crowd of onlookers keen to see the flashy prizes on offer.          The draw was held on January 11, 1569 by St Paul\u0027s Cathedral in London (which is depicted as it appeared in Tudor times in a 1916 engraving). To amuse the audience, ticket-holders were allowed to hide their identities by writing jokey remarks on their tickets. These messages included anti-Catholic quips such as \u0027In God I hope and a far for the Pope\u0027      The lottery was not the money-raising success it might have been and was never repeated by Elizabeth. England was increasingly becoming a global power in the latter years of her reign. Pictured: A map of Drake\u0027s Great Expedition in 1585 by Giovanni Battista Boazio          A sign of the threat from Catholic powers came in 1570, a year after the lottery draw, when the Pope Pius V issued a Bull (or decree) declaring Elizabeth a heretic.

as No10 admitted she still has not managed to get concessions to help sell her Brexit deal to MPs.The PM has been ringing round counterparts as she tries to obtain \u0027legally binding\u0027 assurances that the UK will not be stuck in the Irish border backstop.The frantic New Year push comes with just over a fortnight to go until the Commons is due to hold a crunch vote on the package thrashed out with Brussels.The EU has flatly dismissed the idea of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement painstakingly put together over two years of negotiations.The bloc also insists there cannot be a time limit on the backstop - although both sides say it should be temporary and fall away once a wider trade pact is sealed.However, senior Cabinet ministers are understood to be convinced that they will get movement from the EU that could win round enough MPs.  Under the backstop arrangements, the whole UK would stay in a customs union with the EU to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - while Northern Ireland would obey some single market rules. Brexiteers have condemned the proposals as they could restrict the UK\u0027s ability to do trade deals elsewhere.And the DUP, which is propping up Mrs May in power, has voiced fury that it would leave Northern Ireland operating under different rules to the rest of the UK. Cabinet Brexit infighting rages as Hammond is accused of...Share this articleThe PM\u0027s spokeswoman conceded today that there was as yet no breakthrough.\u0027She has been in touch with European counterparts over the break and you can expect more of that to continue this week,\u0027 the spokeswoman said.\u0027There is still work to do.\u0027Meanwhile, there is no sign of a New Year Brexit truce in Cabinet as ministers turned on Philip Hammond over funding for no-deal plans.The Chancellor has allocated billions of pounds to contingency preparations in case the UK crashes out of the EU in March.But Mr Hammond - known as one of the fiercest opponents of no-deal Brexit - has been berated for dragging his feet about releasing the money.  Communities Secretary James Brokenshire has written to the Treasury warning that councils face huge pressures with a potential \u0027influx\u0027 of elderly expats and the threat of civil unrest, according to the Telegraph.His department had asked for more than double the £35million it was handed by Mr Hammond to bolster preparations by local authorities.           Mrs May and Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured) had some tense exchanges at an EU summit earlier this month    The Chancellor (pictured right with Theresa May earlier this month) has allocated billions of pounds to contingency preparations in case the UK crashes out of the EU in MarchMr Brokenshire apparent warned that failing to provide more funding meant a \u0027significant risk of disruption\u0027.At least one other department is believed to have raised concerns about the situation. A source told the Telegraph: \u0027The Treasury is not releasing the money. It\u0027s all very well for Philip Hammond to tell Cabinet he\u0027s putting £2billion into no-deal preparations, but it\u0027s no good if they won\u0027t actually release the money.\u0027 The latest infighting emerged after Cabinet Brexiteer Liam Fox said the chances of Britain leaving the European Union will be little more than \u002750-50\u0027 if Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal is rejected by Parliament in a crunch vote next month.The International Trade Secretary warned fellow MPs that failure to pass Mrs May\u0027s package would be \u0027incendiary\u0027 and said it was \u0027a matter of honour\u0027 for them to support the PM. EU commission chief  Jean-Claude Juncker has called on the UK to \u0027get your act together\u0027 over BrexitHe also rejected claims of a plot to keep the UK in the EU \u0027by all possible means\u0027 and revealed he fears the majority of MPs \u0027deeply distrust\u0027 both the EU and Theresa May.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/28/01/051D8DB5000003E8-0-image-m-52_1540686674939.jpg","title":"Real life Poldark characters Grade II Georgian home St Ives harbour views market 1 2m","story":"    The impressive four-storey house has uninterrupted panoramic views over the harbour, St Ives Bay and along the Cornish coastline.

The EU Commission declined to give the exact bill, but confirmed that Mr Juncker flew with a 13-person delegation and that travel costs averaged £2,357 per person.He met Tunisian officials to discuss projects between the north African country and the EU during the trip in October. In addition, Mr Juncker, who after a pay rise will earn more than £350,000 a year, claimed £428 for a hotel and £47 for \u0027daily allowances\u0027. The cost of another private jet for a visit in November to Helsinki in Finland, where he had dinner with world leaders before attending the European People\u0027s Party conference, was up to £23,422.Again the EU Commission declined to give the exact bill, but confirmed that Mr Juncker went with an 11-person delegation and that travel costs averaged £1,953 per person.The most expensive \u0027per person\u0027 private jet trip was a one-night visit to Madrid for a lecture and to meet King Felipe VI of Spain before attending an exclusive ceremony for the Marquis de Villalobar award. Travel per person is listed as £6,734, but the overall cost of the private jet has not been revealed.A four-night tour of West Balkan countries was the second most expensive per person for travel, at £6,374.Other private jets were used when Mr Juncker was giving speeches and two were for \u0027working\u0027 dinners and lunches with German chancellor Angela Merkel. He took six private jets to events in neighbouring Germany.

Most were in Europe.For long-haul trips, such as EU-China and EU-Japan summits and a meeting with President Donald Trump in Washington in July, he used commercial airlines.Mr Juncker used his 2018 State of the EU speech to warn of the threat of climate change, which campaigners say is fuelled by emissions from air travel. He said Europeans want to \u0027leave a cleaner planet for future generations\u0027.But many of the flights he took were over relatively short distances. For example, Brussels is only 405 miles from Berlin as the crow flies.A spokesman claimed yesterday that the EU Commission is \u0027one of the most transparent administrations in the world\u0027. He also pointed out that delegations formed of several people use the private jets, bringing down the cost per head. \u0027The Commission has rules which ensure that we carry out our work – including travel – in the most cost-effective way possible,\u0027 he said. \u0027The way we spend the EU budget is controlled annually by the democratically elected European Parliament.\u0027The spokesman claimed \u0027the bulk of travel\u0027 by Mr Juncker is on commercial airlines, adding: \u0027By our own rule, the use of chartered air transport can only be considered when commercial flights are not available to reach a destination, when they cannot fit with the president\u0027s diary commitments or for security reasons.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/31/07/04E43244000003E8-0-image-m-6_1546241525207.jpg","title":"Theresa promises new chapter New Year message","story":"    Mrs May said during her New Year address that 2019 would mark a \u0027new chapter\u0027 for BritainMrs Leadsom, who was a leading pro-Leave figure in the referendum campaign, said the agreement hammered out with Brussels delivered on the 2016 vote.In an article for the Daily Mail, right, she challenged fellow Eurosceptic Tory MPs to get behind the policy or risk renewed calls for a second referendum, which she pledged to \u0027fight tooth and nail\u0027. The Leader of the House said: \u0027We can come together to support this deal, or we can throw the negotiations back into limbo and undermine our democracy.\u0027Should that happen, I know many will be demanding a second referendum andor an extension to Article 50.\u0027I will fight tooth and nail against any such outcome.

File image used Millions across the globe party celebrate the New Year as...Theresa May says Britain will be free to tackle NHS...Share this articleFindings from the study, which was based on the responses of more than 2,500 social media users to promotions published by the Alcohol Concern charity, were published as an estimated five million people prepare to take part in the Dry January exercise.The Dry January idea - a longstanding habit among some drinkers who use the post-Christmas period to take a break from hangovers - has expanded in recent years and has now been taken up by alcohol charity campaigners.The Leeds study said that Dry January followers are not interested in the charity fundraising often carried out by those who succeed in resisting alcohol for the month, but that they were motivated by personal benefits.Participants talk about the quality of their sleep, their appearance, energy levels, weight loss, self-belief and their surprise at finding they have willpower, it said.The report added: \u0027Dry January differs from many government health campaigns from around the world, as it reinforces the positive experiences that come from abstaining from alcohol, rather than highlighting the effects of alcohol and the health impacts of drinking.\u0027          More and more young people are opting for \u0027Veganuary\u0027 instead of Dry January It said that \u0027Government agencies might consider reshaping alcohol policies in the light of the popularity and apparent success of this campaign.\u0027Dr Yeomans, Associate Professor in Criminology and Criminal Justice at the university\u0027s law school, said that Dry January \u0027makes a substantial impact on the lives of a great number of participants.\u0027It brings physical, psychological and emotional benefits in both the short-term and the long-term. \u0027Participants generally feel that they are gaining something rather than losing something by abstaining for one month. Dry January is not about self-control or self-denial it is about self-formation.\u0027The paper, published in the journal Drugs: Education, Prevention and Policy, criticised past taxpayer-funded alcohol campaigns which warned over the effects of limited quantities of alcohol.These included a 2012 Change4Life project which told people that just two drinks a day \u0027could lead to lots of nasty things like a stroke, breast cancer or heart disease.\u0027In 2008 a campaign called \u0027Units. They All Add Up,\u0027 was based around film of people drinking small quantities at different times. \u0027It told viewers that going over the recommended limit for a day \u0027could add up to a serious health problem.\u0027The Leeds report said: \u0027In both instances, the campaign materials thus used essentially negative tools in an attempt to prompt iniduals to reduce their drinking by making them fearful of the long-term consequences of not doing so.\u0027It comes in the wake of a row between anti-alcohol campaigners last year (sub: 2018) over how strongly to condemn drink and whether to co-operate with the alcohol industry.The taxpayer-funded Public Health England joined industry-subsidised organisations to push a \u0027drink-free days\u0027 plan, which encouraged middle-aged people to leave days free from alcohol.However prominent advisers to Public Health England threatened to quit because they believed that co-operating with alcohol producers and retailers would undermine attempts to cut consumption."},{"url":null,"title":"Now THATs extraordinary life remember infamous characters lost 2018","story":"    One of the last of \u0027The Few\u0027, Wellum was barely out of basic training when he was thrown in to the thick of the Battle of Britain at the controls of a SpitfireOne of the last of \u0027The Few\u0027, Wellum was barely out of basic training when he was thrown in to the thick of the Battle of Britain at the controls of a Spitfire.Narrowly avoiding death on numerous occasions, he went on to serve across Europe, earned the Distinguished Flying Cross and took part in the heroic mission to resupply besieged Malta.By the age of 22, however, his nerves were shredded.

The latest images of the object reveal an elongated shapeOnce it enters the peripheral layer of the belt, containing icy bodies and leftover fragments from the solar system\u0027s creation, the probe will get its first close-up glance of Ultima Thule, a cool mass shaped like a giant peanut, using seven on-board instruments.          Nasa tweeted after the flyby that confirmation of the signal from the spacecraft will be made public at 9.45amThe first image of Ultima Thule\u0027s shape was taken during the spacecraft\u0027s approach but clearer pictures are not expected for some time as it can take several hours for radio signals to reach Earth from that far away.Flight controllers said everything looked good for New Horizons\u0027 flyby of the tiny, icy object nicknamed Ultima Thule at 12:33 a.m. on Tuesday. The mysterious, ancient target  is 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometers) from Earth and is in the Kuiper Belt.Scientists wanted New Horizons observing Ultima Thule during the encounter, not phoning home. So they had to wait until late morning before learning whether the spacecraft survived.          The green segment of the line shows where New Horizons has traveled since launch while the red indicates the spacecraft\u0027s future pathWith New Horizons on autopilot, Mission Control was empty at Johns Hopkins University\u0027s Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. Instead, hundreds of team members and their guests gathered nearby on campus for back-to-back countdowns.The crowd ushered in 2019 at midnight, then cheered, blew party horns and jubilantly waved small U.S. flags again 33 minutes later, the appointed time for New Horizons\u0027 closest approach to Ultima Thule. A few black-and-white pictures of Ultima Thule might be available following Tuesday\u0027s official confirmation, but the highly anticipated close-ups won\u0027t be ready until Wednesday or Thursday, in color, it is hoped.\u0027We set a record. Never before has a spacecraft explored anything so far away,\u0027 said the project\u0027s lead scientist who led the countdown to the close encounter, Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute. \u0027Think of it. We\u0027re a billion miles farther than Pluto.\u0027           New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern (C) of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), Boulder, CO, celebrating with school children at the exact moment that the New Horizons spacecraft made the closest approach of Kuiper Belt object Ultima Thule on Tuesday, January 1          Stern called it an auspicious beginning to 2019, which will mark the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u0027s footsteps on the moon in July 1969.

Then the spacecraft was to turn briefly toward Earth to transmit word of its success. It takes over six hours for radio signals to reach Earth from that far away.Scientists believe there should be no rings or moons around Ultima Thule that might endanger New Horizons. Traveling at 31,500 mph (50,700 kph), the spacecraft could easily be knocked out by a rice-size particle. It\u0027s a tougher encounter than at Pluto because of the distance and the considerable unknowns, and because the spacecraft is older now.          The flyby was fast, at a speed of nine miles (14 kilometers) per second. Seven instruments on board recorded high-resolution images and gather data about its size and composition\u0027I can\u0027t promise you success. We are straining the capabilities of this spacecraft,\u0027 Stern said at a news conference Monday. \u0027By tomorrow, we\u0027ll know how we did. So stay tuned. There are no second chances for New Horizons.\u0027The risk added to the excitement.

It was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope and added to New Horizons\u0027 itinerary.Deep inside the so-called Kuiper Belt, a frigid expanse beyond Neptune that is also known as the Twilight Zone, Ultima Thule is believed to date back 4.5 billion years to the formation of our solar system. As such, it is \u0027probably the best time capsule we\u0027ve ever had for understanding the birth of our solar system and the planets in it,\u0027 Stern said.In classic and medieval literature, Thule was the most distant, northernmost place beyond the known world.

Margaret Campbell actually went by the name Rita, making her daughter\u0027s search for her more difficult  but they finally met in 2016 (pictured)Norah added: \u0027I\u0027m eternally grateful - I told her \u0027if it wasn\u0027t for you, I wouldn\u0027t have my five grandchildren\u0027.\u0027She created all these lives by going through what she did.\u0027I had to say that to her.\u0027Grandmother-of-five Norah was finally able to get in touch with her birth mother after a TV production company helped with her research.Two years ago, Rita travelled all the way from Canada to Scotland to meet her daughter and they were reunited at Glasgow Airport.Norah, from Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire said: \u0027My mother was unmarried when she had me, and her parents took control. She never had a say in the matter.\u0027Care worker Norah was inspired to seek out her birth mother after being told at a guest at her own wedding \u0027Your mother would be very proud of you\u0027.The glamorous bride was aged 19 when she wed ex-husband Kenneth McMaster and was shocked when her ancestry was mentioned.But with the demands of raising four children, Andrew, Gregor, Ross and Lesley, and the tragic loss of her first child, Kenneth, her intentions of tracking down the woman who gave birth to her fell by the wayside.And Norah was afraid of upsetting her adoptive parents John and his second wife, Peggy, who he married after the death of his first wife, also named Norah.She described the couple as \u0027exceptional\u0027 and loving.After their deaths, she trawled through records in Edinburgh and discovered that when she was born, the name given to her was Anne.

Like many in the audiobook world, he believes this commercial success has coincided with a creative flourishing.He says the potential of book narration became apparent after his marathon recording of the English language version of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s acclaimed six-part book series, My Struggle.“Narrating these books was not only personally extraordinary, but at the vanguard of the evolving art of narration,” he told the .The completion of book six this year, for the New York-based Recorded Books, marks the end of a project that has taken five years to finish. The six volumes clock in at more than 133 hours, one of the the longest commercial recordings by a single narrator and almost twice as long as unabridged recordings of the Bible.Ballerini says recording My Struggle was the most difficult job in a 23-year acting career that has included roles in The Sopranos and the film Dinner Rush. Feedback from listeners highlighted how audiobooks, and the way they are consumed on smartphones, provide an intimate new way to reach audiences, he says. “The relation between narrator and listener has become much more personal. You’re in their home, lying in bed with them, in their cars, in the gym, or wherever it. It’s very one-on-one, there’s no sound or visual effects, it is just a voice in their heads.”He adds: “With the Karl Ove recordings people have written me in very personal ways about their experience of listening, which I’ve not gotten from any other project.”An artist told Ballerini she heard his voice in her paintings after listening to him reading Knausgaard as she worked. Another fan sent him pottery she said Ballerini’s recording had helped her to create. A couple who were stranded by snow for weeks said the My Struggle recordings helped them survive the winter.Some take issue with Ballerini’s description of it as a new art form. The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has run a a talking books service for more than 80 years.Daryl Chapman, the studios manager at the RNIB, says: “I wouldn’t say narration is a new art form, rather one that’s been evolving over time.”Oral storytelling dates back to the earliest days of human language. “Cultures often venerated professional story tellers even though they weren’t generating new stories so much as re-telling the old ones,” says Joseph Devlin, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London. Devlin’s research found listening to stories increased people’s emotional engagement more than watching video.“I agree with Ballerini that there is an intimacy in the audio format. As a listener you engage more by virtue of co-creating the content with the narrator.”Paul Stokes, the founder of the blog Audiobook Review, says: “In less than 10 years, the world of audiobooks has exploded. Using smartphones enables listeners, authors, and narrators to connect on many different levels”He cites the example of Soundbooth Theatre, which runs live narrations based on YouTube requests, allowing audiences to have a say on how characters are read.Knausgaard approved the casting of Ballerini to read his books, but the two men have never met. “I was afraid meeting the man would shatter some things, and I’ve not even listened to him speak,” Ballerini says.But now that the project is complete, he is keen to meet someone he regards as “the author I was born to narrate”. Ballerini treasures a signed copy of book three of the series in which Knausgaard describes him as “my American voice”.Ballerini says he sometimes found it difficult to get out of character, when channelling Knausgaard. “I felt like it had gotten under my skin so deeply. It was like he was opening a window for me to see my own life. Maybe that’s the case with a lot of people, which is why the books are so compelling.”He says the experience of reading the 3,600 pages aloud was like “a big therapy session”, and admits to dreaming about Knausgaard and incidents in the books.Sarah Shrubb, an audio publisher at Little, Brown Book Group, says narrators often break down in tears reading aloud in the studio, especially when authors are reading their own work.“It’s incredibly difficult and you don’t have the feedback of an audience. It’s just you and the microphone creating these amazing soundscapes in your head. You have to play all of the characters and all their voices and to be able to do them well is a real art form.”Shrubb says drama schools are beginning to take notice. “It is becoming an art form that is being taught in colleges. It is not just something actors do between jobs, it’s a career.”Ballerini acknowledges that his view of the status of audiobooks is an unusual one. “To describe an audiobook as being the largest thing of someone’s career is probably a new kind of claim,” he said. “But it is one that I stand by.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a00ef9a37a0242b0406e5b2faa7c6daf608e63d2/2_43_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3722245d72a1345fe7c2fcca2d5ae9fd","title":"how to be invisible kate bush review","story":"The singer-songwriter’s lyric collection is free of explanation yet still explores her curiosity for life and loveTrust Kate Bush, never one to explain, to complicate the straightforward lyrics collection. She doesn’t annotate this anthology, unlike Neil Tennant’s recent Faber edition. Instead, subtler direction follows an introduction by author David Mitchell, who wrote the spoken-word parts of Bush’s 2014 Before the Dawn performances. Mitchell intermingles charming fannish detail with close textual analysis that illuminates familiar songs: it is God, he points out, not the devil, who allows the man and woman to exchange their sexual experiences on Running Up That Hill, an act of inity rather than transgression.But Mitchell is wrong on one key point. “Kate’s the opposite of a confessional singer-songwriter in the mould of Joni Mitchell during her Blue period,” he asserts. “You don’t learn much about Kate from her songs.” Which begs the question of how we might know a songwriter. It’s true that Bush’s personal life is so opaque that an interview betraying her Netflix habits offered grounding intimacy. Another where she described Theresa May as “the best thing that’s happened to us in a long time” burst a bubble some fans were keen to preserve. More dispiriting than partisan matters was her opinion that “it is great to have a woman in charge of the country”. If Bush’s songwriting tells us anything, it’s that her understanding of gender and power is typically more complex.This understanding is one thread of How to Be Invisible, which splits selections from her catalogue across 10 newly curated sections, offering no clear framing devices. (Only Aerial’s A Sky of Honey suite and Hounds of Love’s second side, The Ninth Wave, remain intact.) Here is how we might find her, wedding Snowflake and Hounds of Love into a consideration of the perils of succumbing to love contemplating alchemy and evolution from Cloudbusting, about a child losing faith in a parent, to Bertie, a tribute to how her son transformed her life. She addresses loss movingly: Aerial’s A Coral Room finds the memory of her late mother in “her little brown jug” The Fog, from The Sensual World, asks how to love when its objects are transient. Houdini and Get Out of My House bookend her strident interrogation in how to remain open to pleasure but protected from deception.Two sections dwell on gender. Joanni, her portrait of Joan of Arc, is juxtaposed with an indictment of masculine warmongering (Army Dreamers). Later, Bush explores masculine and feminine perspectives, contemplating desire (Reaching Out) and obligation (Night in the Swallow), never reaching trite conclusions.If there is one to be drawn from How to Be Invisible, it isn’t that Bush is unknowable, but that life is: how much can we ever know about love, ourselves, the things we lose? She is never cowed by the uncertainty. Her songwriting suggests the only way to weather it is with curiosity applying silliness as courageously as literary seriousness, balancing spiritual insight alongside unabashed carnality, domestic truth alongside fantasy, never concerned by contradictions.Desire runs wild in the final section: Mrs Bartolozzi’s sexual laundry fantasia the wily, windy Wuthering Heights. This headstrong pursuit has guided Bush. The question is not what we can learn about her, but what we might learn from following her lead.• How to Be Invisible by Kate Bush is published by Faber (£14.99).

Brexiteers cling on to a fantastical mixture of empire, war and an England whose genius was supposedly embodied by Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. In the United States, Donald Trump harks back to an America of economic might: musclebound men toiling in car factories and coalmines, and splendid isolation. A recent issue of the Economist surveyed politics in Europe and the US and observed “an orgy of reminiscence”, partly traceable to the fact that millions of westerners cannot shake off a deep and understandable sense of decline.There’s an obvious irony in having to look back to find something better, but 2019 marks the 30th anniversary of a run of events that embodied pretty much the polar opposite: optimism, faith in the future and a sense of shared humanity that could not be more different from the polarised, rancorous mood of today. As this year unfolds, the events of 1989 – a year as replete with significance as 1848, 1945 or 1968 – will be celebrated and picked apart in Berlin there will be an impressive run of commemorative events . Leafing through histories of the time, and thinking back to what happened, what most sticks out is a set of emotions and impulses that we would do well to revive: defiance, joy, an urge to run headlong into whatever happened next.The year 1989 was one of largely peaceful revolutions that swept through central and eastern Europe, calling time on Soviet communism. In that region of the world, humanity confronted a wall of power that surreally crumbled away. If you want a sense of what was suddenly afoot, have a look at the famous footage of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu on 21 December 1989 unsuccessfully attempting to subdue a crowd suddenly full of a sense of their collective power, and thereby realising he was finished.Six months before, when the same spirit of defiance surfaced in Beijing, the result was the carnage of Tiananmen Square, though events there gave the world another vivid image of what it is to directly confront your oppressor: the famous lone protester – whose identity remains unknown – standing before a line of tanks, vainly trying to stop the inevitable. That picture now stands as a breathtaking embodiment of 1989’s emancipatory spirit, and how easily it could be snuffed out. But in eastern Europe, a sense of liberation and possibility seemed to prevail, and even to reach the crabby old UK.Alexandra Richie’s masterful history of Berlin, Faust’s polis, rightly characterises what happened in the German capital in 1989 as the culmination of a story that had begun elsewhere in the old eastern bloc: in Poland, Hungary and, perhaps most crucially, the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev. But she evokes the wonderment that transpired as people walked in amazement from East to West: “Delirious crowds continued to surge across – some in their nightclothes and bedroom slippers everyone sensed that this was a moment that they would savour for the rest of their lives ... the party lasted well into the night Radio Sender Freies Berlin said that more than 50,000 had crossed into West Berlin on that first night alone, people who had come ‘just to see’, for the night.”Closer to home, the upsurge known as acid house had decisively arrived in the summer of 1988, and quickly attracted a mixture of tabloid outrage, government hostility and police suppression. Its two basic components were electronic (and futuristic) dance music, and ecstasy – the drug that filled its users with the euphoric sense of connection to others known as being “loved up”. The result, played out every week in the huge Manchester club the Hacienda, was perfectly described to me by its co-owner, Tony Wilson: “You could take any human being, of any sort, to the Hacienda from mid-89 onwards and they would just love it. Human beings love fun and happiness and exuberance, and it was the epitome of that.”I was one of those people. If anything, Wilson’s testament was an understatement. It may seem fanciful to draw lines between scenes on British dancefloors and what was afoot in former communist countries, but they are obvious enough. The 1980s had been a decade of social ision, nuclear paranoia and endless strife. Now, if you were in the right place at roughly the right time, what seemed to be superseding all that was a profound sense that a new era was opening, and many of the miseries of the previous decade would be over. By the end of 1990, Nelson Mandela was out and Thatcher was out seven years later, the fact that New Labour was able to seize on a mood of pop-cultural optimism was proof that some of 1989’s spirit had lingered on.But as the Blair years would prove, the legacy of 1989 would also curdle into hubris. In the summer of 89, the American economist Francis Fukuyama famously declared the final triumph of liberalism and the alleged end of history, a belief enacted in the real world by the application of brutal free-market economics to the newly liberated countries of eastern Europe, which spread a resentment that still runs deep. The fate of the Balkans proved that the euphoria of 1989 was often completely misplaced. And the same arrogance that defined the western powers’ economic policies would lead on to the Iraq war – a fatal application of the cursed concept of “liberal interventionism”, which was 1989-era triumphalism all over.Today Poland and Hungary are bywords for nostalgic populism. In Russia, Vladimir Putin’s raison d’etre seems to be avenging the west’s post-89 humiliation of his country, re-rooting its self-esteem in the Soviet era. In contrast to 1989’s all-too-brief burst of people power, we seem to be stranded in an era of strongmen and rampant nationalism, in which the open, liberating nature of 1989’s crowds has been superseded by the baying of online mobs. And for all that pop music and its surrounding culture still seem to offer a erse, colourblind antidote to the nastiness and hatred in our midst, an upsurge as huge and transformative as acid house seems unthinkable.All of which comes down to a set of obvious iron rules: that parties have to end, that history speeds on, and that things always turn out to be much more complicated than they first appear. Nonetheless, across the world, the social liberalism and internationalism that defines a large share of my generation and took deep root among millennials is one of 1989’s obvious legacies and the fact that Trump, Brexit and the new populism are so loudly contested is proof that the world really did change. And, as 1989 teaches us, everything will sooner or later change again. The demagogues and chancers of our time will have their own Ceaușescu moments, and today’s walls will eventually come down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ed4c1b02227f8d4e395d37a5c260eeb32e5d152/0_160_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06b0db71140f327442f821600fc57e8e","title":"heres how to crack your new years resolutions","story":"Practicing gratitude, compassion and resilience can help us keep our New Year’s resolutionsIn a society as obsessed with success as ours – where bestsellers offering advice on how to be gritty, goal-directed, and disciplined line the shelves of almost every bookstore – this seems a rather odd situation. If the advice science has been offering for how to reach goals is on target, why are the success rates so low? It’s because the advice we’re being given is wrong.To understand why, we should consider what resolutions are. At base, they’re almost all a form of a dilemma economists term intertemporal choice, meaning decisions that have different consequences as time unfolds. Keeping resolutions usually requires accepting some sacrifice in the moment to gain rewards in the future. For example, regularly putting money in an IRA (independent retirement account) rather than spending it to enjoy the newest smartphone or overpriced restaurant helps ensure a more enjoyable retirement eating a kale salad for lunch, while maybe not bringing as much immediate enjoyment as a double cheeseburger, helps ensure a healthier future.Yet while most of us would agree with this logic, we don’t typically follow it. Research by Kathleen Vohs at the University of Minnesota shows that, on average, people give into temptations that conflict with their long-term goals about one out of every five times they try to resist – a figure that rises rapidly if they’re tired, busy or stressed.The root of the problem is that our brains have a bit of a glitch: they over-value immediate pleasures relative to future ones. For example, in my own research, we found that people view $100 in a year as worth only $17 today. Or, put differently, if we gave them $17 dollars today, they’d forgo getting $100 in a year. Unless you need that money for immediate survival, turning down the opportunity to quintuple your money in a year doesn’t make much sense. Yet, people continually use such questionable “logic” with all types of rewards.The way we’re usually told to resist desires for immediate pleasures that get in the way of pursuing long-term goals is to use willpower. If you want to get a promotion or better grades this year, put your nose to the grindstone rather than spending time listening to music you enjoy. If you want to lose weight, force yourself to go to the gym rather than revel in an extra helping of dessert. Logical, yes easy, no. A good deal of research shows that it’s difficult and often stressful to continually force yourself to choose the less of two desirable options. But in truth, that’s what it means to use willpower.And herein lies the problem. What all those bestsellers neglect to say is that willpower isn’t the only tool that fosters the self-control and grit we need for success. The mind comes equipped with another powerful source of motivation: emotions. And when it comes to problems of intertemporal choice – ones where we need to be more oriented toward future goals – the emotions that matter are the moral ones.For most of human history, what led to success was good character. You had to be seen as a good partner, as someone worth cooperating with. That meant you had to be honest, fair and generous acts that require making a sacrifice to share, as opposed to being selfish, in the moment to ensure greater rewards in the future. And it was emotions such as gratitude, compassion and a pride in one’s true abilities and reputation that supported these virtues, a fact backed up by modern psychological science.What our research has demonstrated, however, is that these emotions help people resist temptation not by increasing willpower, but by simply nudging the mind to place a greater emphasis than it normally would on future rewards relative to immediate ones. For instance, grateful people don’t see $100 in a year as worth only $17 today. To them, it’s worth double that. And similar effects are found for pride and compassion.The upshot, of course, is that by increasing the value people place on future gains, these emotions make persevering toward those goals much easier. And as you’d expect, regularly feeling these emotions has been shown to increase time spent on difficult tasks, to reduce procrastination, to increase regular exercise, to enhance performance on the job, and to reduce addictive or impulsive behaviors – all things that require resisting temptations that ert people from pursuing future success.Unlike relying on willpower, cultivating these emotions throughout the coming year offers a less stressful way to help keep your promises to yourself intact. Yet doing so also offers an added benefit. It will make sure that as you’re striving to reach your goals, you will be strengthening your relationships. Practicing gratitude, compassion and an authentic pride (as opposed to hubris) binds you to others, and in so doing, makes certain that you’ll look back on 2019 not only as a year where you reached a personal goal, but also made a difference in the lives of those around you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/211826910331408e03d5919900d862bb7cff19d9/0_212_3175_1904/master/3175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d246ed117e9a4fbc00f4a33e4c8ce431","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of fizz","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘fizz’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘fizz’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what fizz means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 2 January at 10am.

To get ahead on summer 2019 fashion, the footwear to buy into is the humble flip-flop. The thonged sandal – which dates back to at least 4000BC – is, of course, a regular sight from beach to city street every summer. But it hasn’t been properly fashionable, arguably, since the early 00s, when women like Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen made it as integral to their LA around-town look as XXXL sunglasses and four-figure handbags worn hooked over one arm.With this era rediscovered by a generation of people who were children around the turn of the millennium, it makes sense that flip-flops are in focus again. They were a trend among influencers at Copenhagen fashion week this year – increasingly a site for emerging street style.Designers from Michael Kors to Molly Goddard featured versions of flip-flops on the catwalk for spring. The Olsen sisters, meanwhile, have consistently worn them. When a photograph of the duo for WSJ magazine was shared on Instagram in August to announce the addition of menswear to their fashion line The Row, it was the black flip-flops they were wearing that caused a frenzy. The post has so far received more than 10,000 likes.Retailers including Net-a-Porter and Asos are tipping the flip-flop as the style for summer 2019. “Flip-flops are a big deal for Asos for spring,” says Aisling McKeefry, Asos head of design. “Originally evolving from Instagram, the trend is for simple toe thong designs on to flats and super-sexy glam heels. Toe loops are also going to be trending.”Elizabeth von der Goltz, global buying director at Net-a-Porter, agrees, saying: “For springsummer 19, Staud are doing this trend particularly well with their chic asymmetric styles in a variety of textured and leather colourways. Chloé too have amazing wrap versions. We’re excited to have bought heavily into these collections for next season.”The stylist Jeanette Friis Madsen, a street-style favourite who was photographed in flip-flops at Copenhagen fashion week, believes their relatability means they are a sure thing for the summer. “They’re easy, affordable, comfortable, casual and fun,” she says. Rather than saving flip-flops for the beach, she advises using them as a way to bring a casual edge to daytime outfits. “They’re perfect to downgrade a flashy summery dress,” she says. “Or mix them up with a pair of wide suit trousers for an effortless expression.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The crisis-hit House of Fraser and an embattled Marks \u0026amp Spencer made headlines, as did a rising tally of planned store closures, and accompanying job losses, deemed necessary in a turnaround plan for New Look. The Orla Kiely brand, famed for its geometric prints, went into liquidation in September, while Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana ends the year under serious pressure, having been dropped by important retailers after a racism scandal shipwrecked a fashion show planned in China.But the most significant downfall to impact on the culture of fashion is that of a store still very much open for business. The undoing of Philip Green, and by association Topshop, is a watershed moment for British high street fashion.Hit by multiple accusations of bullying and sexual harassment, Green was further humiliated by being dropped by as a business partner by Beyoncé, who cut ties between her Ivy Park athleisure brand and Topshop after the allegations. The launch event for Topshop’s keynote partywear collection this season, a collaboration with the up and coming designer Michael Halpern, was cancelled at the last moment. There will be no star-studded parties celebrating Topshop’s place at the centre of the British fashion ecosystem this year, for the simple reason that it can no longer lay claim to that position.This decade has seen the young shoppers who are Topshop’s key market moving from bricks-and-mortar shopping, a field in which Topshop was dominant, to online, in which it faced stiff competition from new and nimble, social media-savvy, price-competitive brands such as Boohoo and Missguided. Furthermore, the BHS pension scandal of 2016 had cut into the personal fortune of Green and his wife, Tina, and forced him to step back from the limelight.The Topshop catwalk shows at which Green would position himself centre-stage, once a biannual sight at London fashion week, have been consigned to history. In his pomp, Green gave himself the prime paparazzi spot each season: next to Kendall Jenner in February 2014, Cara Delevingne in February 2015, Anna Wintour in September 2015, and Kate Moss in September 2017.In 2018, however, there were no Topshop catwalk shows at London fashion week. The programme of sponsoring catwalks for emerging designers, along with the lavish champagne-soaked hospitality that became a symbol of Green’s status, was already being pegged back by the beginning of this year.While few tears have been shed for Green, the decline of Topshop illustrates another shift in fashion: the end of a golden age of the high street. From the early 00s to the beginning of this decade, Topshop was the poster child for a fashion culture in which glamour and newness were democratised and made available to shoppers on a mass budget for the first time. Catwalk images had previously been a closely guarded secret in the months during which clothes shown at fashion week went into production, which meant high street retailers operated on a six-month time lag, unable to begin work on high street versions of the “new look” until the designer clothes went on sale.The internet changed all that. Images became immediately available, enabling savvy high street teams to interpret the trends and deliver them to suit their customers just as fast as Bond Street. Topshop – thanks to a talented and largely female team led by Jane Shepherdson – exploited this opportunity better than anyone else, delivering up to the minute, well-priced fashion.Green’s heavily stage-managed front row photo opportunities signified more than just the roarings of his rampant ego. Having Vogue cover girls attend a Topshop fashion show reflected a time when fashion’s class system appeared to have melted away.It was not to last. The latest hemlines, as decreed by the most chic designers in Paris or the colour-dominating catwalks in Milan, had once been thrilling plot twists that kept fashion customers hooked. Now that all of fashion’s secrets were out in the open, these plot twists – otherwise known as trends – lost their power over women’s shopping habits.Topshop’s cachet had been based on being the closest a high street shopper could get to catwalk fashion. But in making it accessible to all, Topshop helped devalue the currency of biannual trends, and the audience ebbed away to find excitement elsewhere – in street style, streetwear, or Instagram, in a new generation of social media-oriented brands.At the same time, a growing awareness of the conditions of workers producing fast fashion and of the environmental impact of throwaway styles dimmed the lustre of fashion as a playground for all. The current crisis has been brought about by a man of whom few are fond, but in its pomp Topshop was a shop millions of women adored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebcad221a6d54bd6f37104a9012f904f7352c49e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b1ad3d6877015b242bb6fa843e2ea86","title":"work it out 10 of the best sweatshirts for men in pictures","story":"Whether you are hitting the gym or not moving from the sofa, a sweatshirt is the go-to piece of kit*Prices correct at time of publication"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8f26e43cdc7055b2587cb3d11f8166f8fce7711/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=301a89b47a85081733b0ef3a436f228e","title":"how to get better at healthy eating shake up your shopping and start cooking","story":"Forget the takeaways, the meals out – and all those overambitious cookbooksThe simplest way to improve your diet and eat more healthily isn’t counting calories, “eating a rainbow”, buying low-fat everything or following any other of the tired, ineffective mantras that are trotted out. In practical terms, the surest way to eat better is cooking most of your food at home or, failing that, talking some other nice person into doing it for you. The more you eat out or rely on convenience food, the more the balance of your diet will go the wrong way. The more food you eat that isn’t homemade, the poorer your diet is likely to be in terms of nutrition and the quality and provenance of its ingredients. If you base your meals on mainly unprocessed or minimally processed ingredients, and cook more often than not, you won’t go far wrong.Motivate yourself for more hands-on activity in the kitchen by calculating how much money you’ll save. It’s easy to spend £20 a week on barely satisfying sandwich-based lunches. The most basic, most functional restaurant meals or takeaways will make an even greater dent in your finances. Kick the habit of reaching for the phone or dropping into the takeaway when you’re hungry and head for the kitchen instead. You’ll free up more money than smokers do when they give up fags.Shake up your shopping habits. Don’t leave thinking about meals to the last minute. Most of all, avoid ending up in the corner supermarket after work, desperately looking for something that you can eat asap. Smaller supermarkets that cater for the lunchtime and post-work trade stock even more junky snacks and assorted products to be avoided than their bigger equivalents. And they offer a stultifying choice that doesn’t change 365 days of the year, which kills the urge to cook. Make a slot for food shopping, and get yourself down to interesting small shops, markets or anywhere the seasons are reflected in what’s on offer and the food isn’t smothered in antiseptic plastic. These environments will make you want to eat, and ideas of what to cook will smack you between the eyes. If you can’t make it to stimulating shops, get a box of high-quality ingredients delivered to your home or work and let the contents inspire you.Initially, because it takes momentum to get into the routine of food preparation, don’t try to cook things you haven’t made before. Forget those dishes you meant to try but never got round to – that approach courts lethargy and self-delusion. Instead, revisit the old favourite recipes in your comfort zone, and remind yourself how much better they are than most of what you could buy eating out. Once you have got into a rhythm, start tackling recipes you have eyed up from afar. You might actually make some of them now.Cookbooks are great, but less is more, especially if you are one of those people who’s better at buying them than cooking from them. Focus on one favourite book that is well within your skill set, one with short ingredient lists, and cook the easiest dishes you can find in it. Once you’re in the swing of regular meal preparation, then, and only then, add new techniques and cuisines – fermentation, sourdough bread baking, Kazakh cookery et al – to your core competencies. Never believe that watching TV cookery programmes is more likely to make you cook. Empirical observation of UK eating habits suggests that the opposite is the case.Instead of trying to cook every day, most fatally in the early evening when you are already knackered, have a major once-a-week cooking session, probably at the weekend, that will break the back of your food preparation burden. Hero dishes here include soups, stews, casseroles, gratins, hefty salads, curries – anything that can be reheated or eaten cold, and served again for packed lunch or dinner in the week. Think in terms of a rolling programme. Last night’s spinach and potato curry becomes tomorrow’s side veg with sausages. Leftover roasted veg, with a bit of cheese crumbled on top, becomes the next day’s workplace salad lunch. Cook once, then eat twice or thrice. Make your dishes in bulk, freeze what’s left, and build up a store of homemade food for days when cooking seems too hard.Don’t let appetite-crushing “healthy eating” guidelines and assorted food scares overrule your good sense about what to eat, or spoil your enjoyment of food. Base your diet around sound ingredients, studiously ignore fads, and reserve a healthy scepticism for everything from top-down government health orthodoxy to the latest trendy diet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f5c27c5f61874b0ae2a69867bfa0cdf44688ca2/0_2206_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=278f6a78aec392f9d9acc00e1bf06231","title":"nigel slater chicken schnitzel recipe","story":"Chicken breasts in a tasty breadcrumb coatCut 2 medium-sized leeks into 2cm-thick rounds.

The hosts were booed off following another dreadful display and a fifth defeat in eight games inflicted by Jamie Vardy’s clinical second-half strike. Silva starts the new year in need of new ideas.Leicester climbed to seventh in the Premier League courtesy of a third win in four matches. Everton, by contrast, are adrift. They have won only once in eight matches, not kept a clean sheet in any of them and were easily contained on home soil yet again. In short, they were clueless and duly punished when Vardy seized on Michael Keane’s mistake.An early kick-off on New Year’s Day brought predictably meagre fare. The atmosphere was akin to a bad hangover with an occasional groan breaking the silence and the performance of both teams did nothing to lift it.Everton created what few opportunities arose in a first half strewn with basic errors. Their first came from a misplaced pass from Harry Maguire to Gylfi Sigurdsson, who picked out Richarlison for a first time shot that struck Jonny Evans. The Brazil international claimed it hit the defender’s arm, referee Martin Atkinson was unmoved, and Evans gave the winger more cause for complaint later on when catching him with a strong but fair challenge.Jonjoe Kenny provided one of the pluses for Silva with an encouraging display in place of Seamus Coleman at right-back. The 21-year-old kept Ricardo Pereira quiet in the Leicester attack and was close to ending the stalemate when reacting quickest to a Lucas Digne cross that evaded its intended targets in the box. Kenny connected cleanly on the far side of the area but hopes of his first Everton goal were dashed by the woodwork. The full-back also set up Dominic Calvert-Lewin for a powerful header that flashed wide of Kasper Schmeichel’s goal.Leicester threatened even less in the first half, despite receiving several invitations by the hosts’ careless distribution. A tame header from Evans was all that concerned Jordan Pickford in the Everton goal and Puel sought improvement by replacing Rachid Ghezzal with Marc Albrighton during the interval. Predictably, given the nature of a dire game, it was a mistake that provided the visitors with a cutting edge and not a change in personnel.The breakthrough stemmed from a Schmeichel clearance that skimmed off the head of Theo Walcott and dropped to Keane midway in the Everton half. Under no pressure, the central defender produced a terrible first touch and gifted possession to Pereira. Quality then made its belated appearance at Goodison. The Portuguese right-back, stationed on the left wing by Puel, sent Vardy through on goal with a perfectly weighted pass. The striker took full advantage of his only chance of the game with a clinical low finish into the far corner.Silva brought on Bernard and Cenk Tosun in an attempt to restore parity but, one shot and one header by the latter aside, Everton’s display remained lethargic and rudderless. They could have been punished further when Vardy broke from another Keane mistake and the defender escaped a handball claim inside the area. Harry Maguire also volleyed over a Ben Chilwell free-kick from only three yards out. His blushes were spared somewhat by an offside flag, but that call was wrong too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f9192279125aace8d1ecfe70302ca3b3385c8f2/0_191_7500_4500/master/7500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a84a84a567f35ced242db60967b89b4a","title":"january transfer window 2019 club by club guide premier league","story":"The midwinter window is open and will close on 31 January – what do the Premier League clubs want and who can they get?Unai Emery is two men down because of long-term injuries to Rob Holding and Danny Welbeck and so he would be open to adding a defender and striker. But with Aaron Ramsey on his way out and the continuing uncertainty over Mesut Özil, what he really wants is a new midfielder. David HytnerA spate of knee injuries has left Eddie Howe with a defensive crisis, particularly at right-back with Simon Francis and Adam Smith sidelined. Howe has stated how January is a notoriously difficult time to recruit, but injuries have forced him into a rethink. Links to Nathaniel Clyne make sense, and Howe admires Brentford’s Chris Mepham. Keeping hold of Callum Wilson, a Chelsea target, will be crucial. Ben FisherChris Hughton has been trying to reduce the burden on Glenn Murray ever since promotion. Attempts to lure the Liverpool forward Dominic Solanke appear to have failed, though Jürgen Locadia’s form has eased anxiety. They have also been linked with Tunisia’s Youssef Msakni. The Rangers captain James Tavernier and Wigan playmaker Nick Powell were previously of interest. BFSean Dyche has described Burnley as minnows when it comes to matching other Premier League clubs for spending power, which is why they frequently raid the Championship in their search for value. The same may happen this January, as long as Burnley can convince targets they are not about to return to the Championship, with West Brom’s Jay Rodriguez and Matt Phillips among the usual suspects, along with Conor Hourihane of Aston Villa. Paul WilsonNeil Warnock said on Saturday that Cardiff had “nine or 10 concrete inquiries in for players”, which provides an indication of how desperate he is to strengthen. He would like to take Nathaniel Clyne on loan from Liverpool but the priority remains a proven striker. A budget of £10-12m feels realistic. Stuart JamesChelsea are attempting to secure Christian Pulisic from Borussia Dortmund for the summer, and have spoken to Juventus and Milan about taking Gonzalo Higuaín on loan. If the latter arrives, Álvaro Morata could depart to San Siro in a similar arrangement. Yet the priority could be squad trimming, with Victor Moses, Gary Cahill and Danny Drinkwater likely to leave, and Tammy Abraham, currently on loan at Aston Villa, potentially also on the move. Dominic FifieldPalace have needed a natural goalscorer all season, and are confident of securing Dominic Solanke on loan from Liverpool. They lack the budget to invest heavily mid-season but may be tempted to add another forward-thinking player, which would allow them to cancel Jordan Ayew’s loan from Swansea and send out Alexander Sørloth for greater game-time. DFMarcel Brands, Everton’s director of football, has stated this will be the quietest window for some time at Goodison Park. “It is not a goal to sell, it’s not a goal to bring in new players,” he said. The need for a quality striker and to secure André Gomes on a permanent deal is pressing, however. Andy HunterFulham may have to cancel Timothy Fosu-Mensah’s loan to bring in another temporary signing from the Premier League, but they will surely find money to spend on permanent deals, even after a vast summer outlay, given their desperation to stay up. They will be tempted to invest in Chelsea’s potential rejects. Danny Drinkwater, after all, has flourished under Claudio Ranieri before. DFWith 12 goals in 20 league matches – and none from their centre-forwards – Huddersfield are crying out for players who can give them a cutting edge, starting with a clinical finisher. David Wagner has said they will do “everything we can” to improve their attack. That may mean breaking the club’s transfer record of £17.5m. Paul DoyleLeicester will be looking to trim rather than add to their bloated and imbalanced squad, with Andy King and Adrien Silva, two of seven central midfielders, expected to depart. The out-of-favour Shinji Okazaki could move on, too. The perennial question for Leicester is where do they find a deputy for Jamie Vardy? SJDespite repeated links to Borussia Dortmund’s Christian Pulisic Jürgen Klopp maintains he is unlikely to move in the January market unless circumstances change and dictate otherwise. Liverpool were the biggest spenders in the summer as they built with a title challenge in mind and a healthy lead at new year has vindicated their planning. AHThe champions insist there will be no incomings, yet given the lack of competition to 33-year-old Fernandinho another defensive midfielder would be welcomed by Pep Guardiola. Lyon’s Tanguy Ndombele is one potential candidate – and his asking price of around £55m is affordable. Left-back is another problem area Leicester’s Ben Chilwell may, again, be of interest. Jamie JacksonAs always there will be sizeable funds available. A centre-back is the prime requirement for the interim manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, given the lack of clean sheets. Porto’s Éder Militão, Tottenham Hotspur’s Toby Alderweireld, Leicester City’s Harry Maguire and Napoli’s Kalidou Koulibaly may be ideal but whether any can be prised away in the winter window is the challenge. JJRafael Benítez wants a playmaker – ideally Atlanta United’s 24-year-old Paraguay international Miguel Almirón – a left-back, a winger and an extra striker. Whether he gets any of those – or even one player on the shopping list – remains to be seen. No one in and around the first-team squad is for sale. Louise TaylorSouthampton blew their modest January budget on Mark Hughes’s severance package and the new manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, wants to trim the squad. He would listen to offers for Cédric Soares, Manolo Gabbiadini, Fraser Forster and Steven Davis. A new right-back and pace in the final third would be welcome. DHMauricio Pochettino resorted to mime when asked whether he would make any January signings, turning his pocket inside out to indicate it was empty. Spurs have no money, as they wrestle with their £1bn stadium project, and any incoming business would have to be funded by outgoings – Mousa Dembélé being one possibility. DHWatford do not intend to sell any members of their first-team squad but some peripheral players will be made available on loan, and they are open to making a small number of signings, in particular a central defender. They would like a proven goalscorer, but given salary constraints and with their need not desperate they may wait until the summer. Simon BurntonManuel Pellegrini spent heavily last summer but an injury crisis could force the manager to dip into the market again. Samir Nasri is set to join on a free when his doping ban ends and Pellegrini also wants more depth in central midfield. Gary Medel, the experienced Besiktas midfielder, could be available for a modest fee. Jacob SteinbergNuno Espírito Santo gives nothing away about Wolves’ transfer plans, but the club are known to be looking for another striker to provide some competition and cover for Raúl Jiménez. Identifying the right players midway through a season, rather than coming up with the money, is the issue for Wolves.

It’s a corner on the right, flicked on at the near post and it flies across goal, just past the toe of Roofe at the far post, and wide! The defender on the far post threw out a leg and got a very slight touch on the ball as it went through, and that’s what stopped Roofe from converting.Talking of struggling teams, Swansea have gone 2-0 up at Reading. It’s extremely messy, Connor Roberts eventually turning home after a bit of ping-pong.Hull are winning again! Kamil Grosicki has given them the lead at home to struggling Bolton. It’s a low cross from the right, and Grosicki hits it into a defender, collects the rebound, and this time lashes it into the roof of the net!That was a fine late run into the box from Xhaka, one that no Fulham player seemed inclined to track, but coming not 90 seconds after Sessegnon’s miss that’s got to smart.Instead it’s Arsenal who steal the lead! Granit Xhaka, also completely unmarked, turns in Iwobi’s cross from the left!Unbelievable miss! Fulham really should be in the lead now, after Schurrle plays the ball into the box and Sessegnon runs onto it at the far post, entirely free of any kind of marking.

It’s a bit scrappy, but a tidy finish from Steven Fletcher, spinning and hooking the ball past the keeper after Bannan’s free-kick was headed down by Lees.Sessegnon has had the best chance of the game so far at Arsenal, but curled his shot just wide.

I’ll put an action shot in here in due course, but here are the kits laid out in the dressing-room pre-match, though you miss the impact of the green shorts.Stoke have won and failed to convert a penalty, Afobe shooting low to his right but the goalkeeper going the right way and saving really quite easily.

Given the constraints enforced by time, space and logic I can’t put up all the EFL line-ups, but do let me know if there are any you’re particularly keen to see.Welcome to the year’s very first clockwatch! Let’s crack on with it, then: today’s Football League fixtures (3pm kick-offs unless stated):We’ve only got one top-flight game to think about this afternoon, so let’s hope it’s a good one.The top three all slipped up on Saturday, and all are away today, against the teams 17th, 18th and 20th in the last-six-game form table – though Blackburn, who host West Brom, have done reasonably well at home of late, losing only one of their last six (to Norwich just before Christmas), a run that started with victory over Leeds back in October. Hull, unbeaten in seven and on a run of four consecutive victories, have a good chance of extending that run at home to a Bolton side that has won once in 15 games. Above is a picture of Nottingham Forest’s City Ground this afternoon – the pasture looks a little ragged down near that corner flag.Portsmouth extended their lead at the top on Saturday with a rambunctious 5-2 win at Fleetwood while Luton could only draw at Walsall, and today are at home to Wimbledon. Their home record is not that great – four teams have won more points than them – but the 23rd-placed Dons might not be the team to test it. Luton, unbeaten at home this season with 10 wins in 12, host fourth-placed Barnsley. Bottom-placed Plymouth could do with three points against Oxford, who are five points ahead in 20th. Above is a new year-themed picture from Peterborough, who play Scunthorpe this afternoon.Other than Grimsby’s game against Mansfield – the top two teams in the ision on form – which having kicked off early will be over by 3pm, today’s League Two fixtures are largely devoid of spice, with none of the promotion-chasing teams playing rivals while towards the bottom the best you’ll get is Yeovil v Cheltenham, 21st v 19th. Yeovil are four points ahead of the bottom two, with the best goal difference in the bottom half of the table (thanks largely to 4-0 and 6-0 away wins over Notts and Newport Counties, the most recent of which happened nearly four months ago).

The hosts were booed off following another dreadful display and a fifth defeat in eight games inflicted by Jamie Vardy’s clinical second-half strike. Silva starts the new year in need of new ideas.Read on below …I’m off now. Thanks for sticking with me, if you did. Football can only get better in 2019. What a strange team Leicester are. In their last five they have lost at Palace and at home against Cardiff and won at Chelsea, at home against Manchester City and away at Everton. Graeme Souness on Sky offers a defence of Puel, who he calls a “football man” who doesn’t have “the waffle and toffee that seems to be around so much these days”. He’s a “common-sense football person”, he says. He may have a point. The one thing I would say that probably works against Puel is how quiet he is. I wonder if that’s why Vardy had to run over to the touchline to get instructions off him. Maybe the whispering Frenchman should be given a megaphone to get his in-match tactical tweaks across to his players.Claude Puel must be mightily relieved to have won that. Even if the owners aren’t happy with him, while Leicester sit in seventh it’s hard for them to sack him. His tactical switch in bringing Albrighton on for Ghezzal helped to win the game. Digne could not get forwards in the second half and Albrighton’s wing play gave Everton’s defence more to think about and afforded Vardy just al little more space. Jonny Evans was a rock at the back too and Ben Chilwell impressed as ever. But Puel’s so lucky to have a striker who is as lethal as Vardy. One half-chance, one goal. Peep! And that’s that. A really poor game is brought to an end. Leicester move up to seventh after a deserved win thanks to an improved second-half performance in which Albrighton helped spark snappier forward play. Everton are booed off. They were awful. They had zero creativity until Bernard came on and Keane’s horrific touch at the back cost them the game. They’re down to 10th and Silva has some thinking to do about how to get his side back on track.90+2 min: Vardy, who was lethal when it most mattered, is replaced by Gray.90+1 min: Everton almost score! Bernard whips a great corner in that Keane heads back across goal. Tosun nips in at the back post and heads across Schmeichel, who spreads himself starfish-style, like his dad, to claw the ball away. That’s the first proper save he has had to make. It looks like he’s won the three points for Leicester.90 min: A dire match will have another three minutes added to it. And Everton have won a corner. Could they?89 min: Tosun has a speculative shot from the edge of the area blocked and Leicester look like they’e going to go clear in seventh. Unless Everton get the ball to Bernard it’s hard to imagine them creating another chance.86 min: Bernard dances inside Chilwell brilliantly and drills a low cross into the six-yard box but no Everton player bothers their behind to get on the end of it. The fans in the Gwladys street are up in arms. That was wonderful wing play.85 min: Kenny wallops a cross into the stands. that kind of sums up Everton’s performance. They’ve been abysmal. Kenny has in fact been one of the few has done OK. 83 min: Chilwell whips in a delicious free-kick to the back post, where Maguire nips in ahead of Zouma and sidefoots over from six yards. That’s a really poor miss. He holds his head in his hands. And that’s no mean feat considering the size of it. 81 min: Tosun clatters Mendy and is booked for his trouble. The free-kick is swung to the backpost by Albrighton (who has impressed since coming on) where Maguire heads the ball on to Keane’s arm. Keane did not handle it intentionally but his arm was in an unnatural position and penalties have been given for less. The irate Leicester fans and Maguire certainly think so. 79 min: Chilwell strides through the Everton defence like a latterday Lothar Mattheus. He almost looks embarrassed to find himself on the edge of the box, from where he hits a tentative right-footed shot straight at Pickford.77 min: Mendy gets the btter of Bernard in a midfield tussle and pings a diagonal ball towards Albrighton, but Zouma stretches out a long limb to get an important touch on the ball ahead of the Leicester winger, who was waiting to pounce. 75 min: Everton are building a head of steam. Bernard twists inside and out just inside the box and then dinks a ball across to Richarlison, whose shot from 12 yards is blocked. Then Everton gain possession and win a free-kick 25 yards out after a late tackle from Evans for which the defender is booked. Sigurdsson’s free-kick clips the wall, though. That was poor for a player with such an impressive dead-ball game.72 min: Ricardo Pereira fizzes a cross into teh near-post that causes Pickford all kinds of problems. Whether he was put off by the ball being so close to his near post or not, I’m unsure, but the England goalkeeper should have kept hold of it but instead spilled it to Ndidi. The Leicester midfielder is so close to the byline that he can’t turn and find a teammmate, though.70 min: Chilwell stretches his legs and skidaddles up the left wing and wins a corner. Albrighton swings it in, but it drifts out of play on the back post before Maguire can head it back into the box. 69 min: Walcott, who has done a great job of hiding in plain sight this afternoon, is replaced by the barrel-chested Cenk Tosun. 68 min: Vardy is becoming a growing threat on the inside-left channel. He has the beating of Keane or Zouma for pace every time the ball is zipped into that channel. As Everton push forwards, they will leave more space in behind for Vardy to exploit.67 min: It’s wasted by Digne though, slammed into the wall when a cross was the much better option. 64 min: Vardy is wasteful in possession after Leicester broke promisingly. He was trying to find Ricardo Pereira inside him but his pass went awry and almost landed at Albrighton’s feet instead. As it happens, Everton clear. Silva really has to work out what his best defensive line up is. It was three at the back in the past two games with a return to a back four today. This formation has not helped them much defensively nor in an attacking sense. They have a free-kick now 35 yards out on the left in a good position for an inswinging cross.62 min: Sigurdsson has a pot-shot that is touched over by Schmeichel. Leicester defend the corner well. Evans has marshalled the Leicester defence with authority this afternoon. 61 min: Tom Davies, who was stripped and ready to come on, has been stood down by Silva. Bernard, a zippy attacking player, is now getting ready to come on. He replaces Gomes. So Everton may play with only one holding midfielder instead of two now.59 min: This is a horrible moment for Keane. Schmeichel clears and the ball is headed back to Keane from Walcott. But Keane’s touch is horrific, bouncing not once, but twice, off the centre-back and landing at Ricardo Pereira’s feet. he plays a first time pass into the channel for Vardy, who beats Zouma in a foot race before drilling a left-footed shot into the corner. A brilliant finish. He’s not had a scrap all afternoon until that chance. 55 min: Gomes finds Digne again with a lovely, disguised pass. This is a brilliant attempt to stave off a substitution. Digne’s cross is deflected for another corner. Another corner that is cleared, this time by Vardy. 54 min: Gomes, perhaps owing to the knowledge that he is about to be hooked, wins the ball back in midfield like a terrier and finds Digne on the left, who wins a corner. It’s cleared at the near post, though. 53 min: Silva’s had enough already. It looks like Tom Davies is going to come on for Gomes. He should at least raise the tempo in midfield. 51 min: Even the cultured Gomes has caught the bug. He’s booked for hoofing Mendy in the air for no good reason whatsoever. 49 min: Leicester have started the half better than Everton. They work the ball forwards with a series of short, simple accurate passes. Albrighton curls a teasing cross in from the right that Pickford struggles to catch and claws to the back post. Ricardo Pereira picks up possession and is ushered away from goal but his cross back into the box is cleared.46 min: Thud! Donk! Whack! Clonk! The low winter sun may be one excuse for the inability of players to play a simple pass to a teammate. They are all much better than this. Ndidi is the latest to give the ball away. 45 min: The second half is under way #prayforthesecondhalfGhezzal, who did the square root of sod all in that half, is replaced by Albrighton. The Everton soundsystem appears to be playing some banging house music. They should leave it on throughout the game. It could help raise the tempo.Some thoughts on a classic half of football at GoodisonVardy had nine touches in that half. I’m surprised it was as many as that. Anyway, here’s an email: “Happy New Year!” whoops Adam Kline-Schoder. “Since nothing much seems to be happening in this ‘intriguing tactical battle’ besides weak passes being sent generously straight to the opposition, I’ll take the opportunity to ask: if Man City need a defensive midfielder, why aren’t they looking at Gueye? Skilled on the ball, good eye for a pass, positionally disciplined … his height, maybe? Or perhaps being 29 they don’t see him as a long-term replacement?” Pep being Pep, I suspect he is looking to buy a full-back who he can convert into a holding player. Seriously though, Gueye is good in that role but I think Guardiola would want a defensive midfielder with more variety in his passing. And, as you say, one who may be a year or two younger. I hope this game isn’t an indication of the kind of year we can expect in 2019. I’m getting a tea. I’d get something stronger if I could. Back shortly. 45 min: There will be one minute of added time. Added time that no one wants. Not even the players – and definitely not the poor fans at Goodison.

Here are your stories and picturesAfter a classic London renting situation, where my partner and I had to live with a leak just above the bed for a month, we finally got the savings together to get a shoebox of our own. No leaks yet, thankfully. It was on the first or second day, while we were eating on the floor over a sheet (with a bit of wine in tumblers), and were laughing and looking out of the window, surrounded by an endless pile of boxes and bags, that I felt a sense of calm I had never experienced before.Lying on my swing seat in my garden, the sun shining and a gentle breeze through the leaves of the birch tree above me. My swing seat was the best purchase I ever made: I’m on holiday whenever I sit on it. Whatever my mood, it answers to it, whether I’m happy or sad, elated or exhausted, with friends or on my own, for breakfast, dinner, lunch or tea. It is the best thing.In the middle of a small barn, in May 2012 at the end of 48 hours of lambing, while sitting on a low hay bale the only human in a barn full of sheep. I am no farmer, and in that barn I was no more than a nursery maid. Sheep mums being mums and lambs being lambs. The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock.Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends.In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives.Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm all was well with the world.In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous.An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world.I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did.My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements.September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday.It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy.Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace.Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path.I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself.In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5b95227e1fd095b3d137c675d211a9daedf19d6/0_0_3329_2219/master/3329.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=55bf87608aee5fcf401bd2d70d40ce91 1760w","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2019 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us cover Last year we published a piece detailing readers’ hopes for 2018’s  coverage, from continuing the fight against fossil fuel disinvestment to “making space for all things vegan”.We now want to hear what you would like us to report on in 2019.

In 2019 she releases her fourth album which, judging by the excellent songs played to the , is sure to be another hit. But she also has a stack of ongoing extracurricular activities.Where has your head been at since the last album?I finished touring, moved to New York, and I was jaded, depleted of any artistic inspiration. I just started cooking, going to the dry cleaners, learning piano. New York doesn’t really have the same rock’n’roll scene it used to, and it was very lonely. I’d often book studios and there’d never be anyone else there. But it gave me a kind of freedom, because there was no one telling me to release an album. I wasn’t forcing myself to write pop songs about boys and relationships, which I used to be so obsessed with when I was younger.And you got engaged. Did you write about that?I have a terrible habit of analysing things to within an inch of their lives, so I didn’t want to overanalyse what I had with him – it’s something much more pure, and something I didn’t need to explain to myself in a song.But on one new song, Love I’m Given, maybe I was reflecting on how I finally felt I’d found this person that was loving me for the right reasons. I don’t think I ever got over being thrust into the spotlight, so I put on quite a tough exterior. I never had time to myself, and any time I did was in a hotel room somewhere – I’d probably had a few drinks, knocked myself out. I don’t know how I could have possibly given a good version of myself to anyone: friends, boyfriends, family. So I’m very grateful Caspar came along, because I feel like I was able to be myself again.What else did you write about?Flux is about thinking about the person who you almost ended up with – I’m a sucker for what could have been. Electricity is about a friend who had been cheated on quite cruelly for a couple of years. But I can’t help writing with empathy, trying to understand why a person has behaved the way they have. Somebody tried to write a song to damage me, and it was a really horrifying thing to go through. I found it really baffling, and just sad, that something that I’d built entirely by myself, my career, was somehow at risk. It had a huge effect on me. But I still didn’t feel the need to be angry – so maybe that’s a good thing.One of my motivations to have a bigger platform as a singer is so that I have more people to reach. Climate change has got to a critical point where we all need to be very active we need to compensate for what’s going on in certain political situations. I know that “celebrities shouldn’t get involved in politics”, but it’s something we have to act on now. I can’t help but feel a bit frustrated that I’m the only one speaking out about something so important – no one else in my peer group is.The next step is electing people who take this seriously, and to trust scientists. And having a bigger consciousness of your day-to-day actions. I don’t eat that much meat I try to use sustainable fashion brands we’re trying to make my tour completely plastic free, and cut down on flights, with a better eco-bus situation. I think I’m probably doing more good than bad, overall."},{"url":null,"title":"hottest music 2019 pop rap jazz","story":"With the uproarious Idles hitting the road, Kamasi Washington play a mind-expanding UK show, and new albums from the Specials, Weezer and AJ Tracey, here are the sounds the new year will be shaking toThe 1975’s progress from cult status to platinum-selling stadium-fillers has looked swift and straightforward, at least from the outside, but it hasn’t come at the expense of their desire to experiment.

Their last album, Dose Your Dreams, was an 18-track conceptual work that returned to the character of David, from 2011’s similarly sprawling David Comes to Life, and took in everything from prog rock and psychedelia to industrial music and disco.

Both seemed out of step with the mood of the times: islands of bleak paranoia and darkness amid of a sea of perky Britpop, and beatifically stoned (and indeed Massive Attack-inspired) trip-hop, respectively. Twenty-one years on, the band take it on tour, apparently reimagined “using custom audio reconstructed from the original samples and influences”. The question of whether the “special guests” will include elusive vocalist Liz Fraser looms large.Tour begins 28 January, SSE Arena, GlasgowThere is something deeply improbable about a band releasing their masterpiece 25 years into their career, but that was what Low did with 2018’s Double Negative, a claustrophobic, experimental and brilliant examination of life in Trump’s America that pushed at the boundaries of their long-established “slowcore” sound. It is not the easiest listen but it is an exceptionally moving and rewarding one, evidence of a rare artistic fearlessness.Tour begins 29 January, Tramway, GlasgowA profoundly unlikely turn of events: 11 years after they reconvened without leader and chief songwriter Jerry Dammers, the Specials release a new album.

How the remaining trio – vocalist Terry Hall, guitarist Lynval Golding and bassist Horace Panter – will fare without them is an intriguing question, although early reports are promising.Released 1 FebruaryThe videos Jimothy Lacoste has uploaded to YouTube have become something of a talking point in recent months: are his optimistic lyrics, guileless rapping style and exuberant dancing for real, or one of those impenetrable millennial gags where irony is piled on irony? He insists it’s the former whatever the answer, there is something undeniably charming and catchy about his music.Tour begins 6 February, King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut, GlasgowExpectations are high for the debut album by the rapper formerly known as Looney. Last year, his self-released single Butterflies made the Top 20, and its dancefloor inflections provide a clue to his eponymously titled album’s sound. Keen for his brand of grime to reflect his Trinidadian roots, he has said the album also features a soca influence and, perhaps a little unexpectedly, tracks inspired by country and western.Released 8 FebruaryA rare UK tour from a genuine soul legend – both as part of Motown’s world-beating Holland-Dozier-Holland writing team and as a solo artist whose 70s oeuvre, not least the oft-covered Going Back to My Roots, should not be overshadowed by the songs he wrote for others. The tour promises “reimagined” versions of his umpteen hits in an intimate, “unplugged” format, interspersed with Dozier telling the stories behind the songs.Tour begins 13 February, Old Market, HoveShould you ever wonder about precisely how much power critics exert over public taste, consider the case of Post Malone, the face-tattoo-bedecked Texan rapper. Released to a widespread yell of horror from reviewers, his second album, Beerbongs and Bentleys, went on to break streaming records on Spotify and reached No 1 on both sides of the Atlantic, making this forthcoming arena tour look not unlike a victory lap.Tour begins 14 February, 3Arena, DublinAs pop stars who rose to fame on television talent shows go, Troye Sivan cuts a pleasingly irregular figure. His second album, Bloom, put his queerness front and centre, quoted Smiths lyrics, featured songs about Grindr and losing one’s virginity as a bottom, and was noticeably influenced by ethereal gothic collective This Mortal Coil. The world could use more pop stars like him.Tour begins 23 February, O2 Academy, GlasgowTrench, the darker, more intense 2018 follow-up to Twenty One Pilots’ multi-platinum breakthrough album Blurryface – home to ubiquitous millennial moping anthem Stressed Out – attracted surprisingly strong reviews. The inevitable subsequent arena tour reaches Britain this year: apparently their live show tends towards the spectacular and comes packed with stunts, including something called “vertical crowd surfing”.Tour begins 27 February, Genting Arena, BirminghamWeezer frontman Rivers Cuomo has been talking about the US alt-rock quartet’s 12th studio album since before their 11th studio album came out. Intended as a darker counterpart to 2016’s Weezer (The White Album), it was briefly put on hold in favour of the electronically inclined Pacific Daydream. It will be seeing the light of day in March, produced by Dave Sitek and apparently sounding like “the Beach Boys gone bad”.Released 1 MarchThese are not the best of times for what would once have been called indie rock, but Brighton based Our Girl – another project from Soph Nathan of the Mercury-nominated Big Moon – bucked the trend with Stranger Today, an atmospheric, potent album packed with great songs recalling the kind of thing 4AD would have released in the late 80s. You can catch glimpses of Pixies and shoegazing about their sound, but there’s a uniqueness and character to it that transcends their influences.Tour begins 4 March, Jacaranda Records Phase One, LiverpoolIt’s perhaps unfair to lay a resurgence of mainstream interest in jazz at the door of one artist, but there is no doubting the impact of Kamasi Washington’s two sprawling albums, The Epic and Heaven and Earth, and his collaborations with Kendrick Lamar and Run the Jewels. The proof that he draws in a far wider audience than usual without compromising his sound or ambition is that he’s playing a venue the size of Brixton Academy.Brixton Academy, London, 5 MarchOf all the fresh-faced, gravel-voiced, acoustic-guitar-toting singer-songwriters who emerged in Ed Sheeran’s wake, George Ezra, perhaps unexpectedly, has proved the most successful. His second album, Staying at Tamara’s, spawned last summer’s most ubiquitous single, Shotgun, and sold half a million copies – evidence of his ability to unite a section of the market that would once have been called teenyboppers with a more mature, Radio 2-friendly audience. So the crowd at these gigs should be intriguing.Tour begins 7 March,  Radio Arena, NewcastleA one-off date from Larry Cummings Kiala, yet another east London rapper who has stormed the charts without the aid of a record label. His career kicked off with a dancehall remake of Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You his sound juggles trap and drill, afro swing and bashment the screams from the crowd evident at his 2018 gigs suggest pin-up status is upon him. This London show will be his biggest British solo gig to date.Brixton Academy, London, 15 MarchNao’s second album, Saturn, was among 2018’s most charming. Less synth-based than her debut, beautifully poised between mainstream R\u0026ampB, funk, heartstring-tugging ballads and something more psychedelic and leftfield, it avoided the obvious in favour of forging a gently eccentric inidual path.Tour begins 20 March, Albert Hall, ManchesterOf all the artists to emerge from the sprawling Odd Future collective, the Internet are, by some distance, the most musically intriguing. While Tyler, the Creator is still capable of grabbing the headlines through his lyrics, Syd and Matt Martian’s band have taken a less controversial route, releasing a string of hugely inventive and futuristic funksoul albums: last year’s Hive Mind was typically great.Tour begins 21 March, Brixton Academy, LondonIdles’ second album, Joy As An Act of Resistance, made a big enough impact to warrant some writers dubbing them “the most important band in Britain”. Certainly, their arty, jagged take on punk carries a ferocious power, while Joe Talbot’s lyrics hold up a mirror to contemporary Britain with slashing wit and a real tenderness. But they’re a band who are really best experienced live in all their chaotic, tumultuous glory.Tour begins 26 March, Leadmill, SheffieldJulia Jacklin’s 2016 album Don’t Let the Kids Win was a minor masterpiece of off-kilter singer-songwriter quirkiness, its idiosyncrasies charming rather than irritating: witty songs about drugged-out boyfriends and wishing Zach Braff and Catherine Deneuve were her parents, with a country-ish lilt to the music. The forthcoming follow-up, Crushing, promises a “rejection of expectations” – starker, more personal, fewer laughs – but the single Body was still spine-tingling, and a handful of UK dates last November sold out.Tour begins 26 March, Haunt, BrightonRay BLK won the BBC’s Sound of 2017 poll, the first unsigned artist to do so. As perhaps should have been expected from an artist whose debut release was an EP based on Miss Havisham from Dickens’s Great Expectations, the path she has followed since has been intriguingly serpentine, some distance from the standard pop-R\u0026ampB approach. Last year’s Empress, an eight-track project that featured Stormzy, offered ample evidence of her talent.Kentish Town Forum, London, 28 MarchThis sounds compellingly bizarre: the 78-year-old electronic pioneer heads out on his first tour, in which he will “conduct, play the vocoder, electronic effects and sounds, play the piano” and “share personal stories that have never left the walls of his studio before”. Titled A Celebration of the 80s, it will also feature a tribute to his most famous collaborator, Donna Summer.Tour begins 1 April, Birmingham Symphony HallStefflon Don is one of the few British MCs who appear to be making headway in the US, thanks partly to her collaborations with Demi Lovato, Future and French Montana, and partly, one suspects, because her flow is less obviously London-accented than her grime peers. She is the first UK artist ever to be included in hip-hop magazine XXL’s prestigious Freshman Class guide to future stars. Her live performances, too, are more spectacular and pop-facing than her grimier peers.Tour begins 13 April, Stylus, Leeds"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3adad714bcc3d955c8f710bd765077e07da6420f/0_0_5302_3535/master/5302.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d1584a10717d2cea639aea93b46c2f4 660w","title":"tell us how are you preparing for a no deal brexit","story":"As the government announces troops will be on standby we want to hear from readers preparing for a no-deal BrexitThe government has agreed to implement no-deal Brexit plans “in full” as it seeks to allay fears by saying 3,500 troops would be on standby to help in event of any crisis.Some 80,000 emails are going out to businesses and business groups this week with advice about no-deal planning, but what about people at home?Earlier this year we heard from readers who were planning to stockpile food after warnings came from the National Farmers Union and the British Retail Consortium.

What I think is fair to say is that on that, as with other appointments, there was no process in which they came before a commission and it was explained to a prospective new peer what was involved in the job.”The former MEP and Labour junior minister became something of a poster child for Lords reform after it emerged he had claimed nearly £57,000 in allowances and expenses in a year, during which he spoke in the chamber just three times. In 2009 he had been suspended from the Lords for six months for offering to amend a bill in exchange for money.A former Conservative council leader who was made a peer in 1998, he was jailed for nine months in 2011 for claiming almost £14,000 for overnight stays in London when he was not in capital. Since then, he has spoken in the Lords five times, the last one in January 2016.Some argue that the patchy record of the Tory former minister – who spoke three times in 2018 – shows attendance is not everything. Lord Fowler notes that while Heseltine contributes rarely, when he does, “he made an extraordinarily good speech”, such as in recent Brexit debates.As Speaker, Fowler has led efforts to reduce numbers. The process, undertaken by consensus, involves encouraging peers to retire and limiting the number of new arrivals, and is already exceeding its targets.“I do think it is completely crazy that we have a system at the moment where the size of the House of Lords is totally open-ended,” Fowler said. “I know of no assembly in the western world, or any other world for that matter, where there isn’t a limit on the numbers. It isn’t a revolutionary thing to say.”After a Christmas break, the Lords will be braced for another potential round of to-ing and fro-ing over Brexit legislation, as amendments shuttle between the houses.In June this process saw the government make concessions on the power of MPs to shape Brexit, after a series of defeats in the upper house. However, Fowler downplays the possible influence of the Lords: “It’s important that people don’t get over-excited about an amendment, because by the process of ping pong it goes back, obviously, to the House of Commons.“Last time we were told we were destroying the legislation – we didn’t destroy it at all. All that the Lords did was say, ‘will you think again on this particular question?’ The Commons did and came to the same conclusion.“It may be famous last words but I don’t think that it’s going to change the whole process itself. That process has got to be decided in the Commons.”Fowler is speaking from his huge corner office in the Lords, formerly used by the lord chancellor, with double-height panelled walls and views directly on to the Thames.It is, he said, something of a contrast to his debut as an MP in 1970. “It’s taken something like 50 years to get to an office like this. The first office I ever had, I shared it with Ken Clarke on one side, John Prescott on the other and Cyril Smith at the end. It was over Boots the chemist. I’ve steadily come up the scale.”Leaning in the fireplace is a poster bearing the slogan “Aids: don’t die of ignorance,” a legacy of Fowler’s tenure as heath secretary, when the HIV crisis first gained prominence.Fowler has since become a celebrated champion of LGBT rights, and briefly breaks his political neutrality to agree equal marriage should be extended to Northern Ireland: “I think it should be a United Kingdom process. It shouldn’t be a matter of debate any more.”For all the advances on Aids – last month Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle announced to the Commons that he was HIV positive but could live an entirely unaffected life – Fowler stresses the “total scandal” that almost a million people a year die still from the disease, mainly in poorer counties.“When I have finished with this job, it is one of the things that I intend to return to, for the years that are left, to campaign on that,” he said.Fowler also said some attitudes remained stuck in the past. “There has been a substantial change,” he said. “It hasn’t been total. I had the other day a peer who came up to me after a series of question before World Aids Day, and said, ‘you know, in my view it’s just all self-inflicted.’ And you think, ‘really?’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c66118b73b4941052c60408bfb1d8daf506fe86/0_1032_4931_2960/master/4931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6c0702618bc864f91f964b912cc094b","title":"time for politicians to make stark choices over climate change","story":"MPs must show leadership on issues such as meat production and air travel, says Clive LewisPoliticians must persuade consumers to make dramatic lifestyle changes if devastating climate change and mass extinctions are to be averted, according to the shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis.From cutting back on red meat to taking fewer flights, the Norwich South MP said the public must face up to “real, stark choices” in the years ahead.“If you want your children and grandchildren to avoid food shortages, to avoid power shortages, to avoid biological degradation, bioersity loss – if you actually want a planet that’s inhabitable – then we need to make some choices together, now, and some of them are about quite dramatic changes to how we live,” Lewis said in an interview with the .Having returned to Labour’s frontbench a year ago, after resigning in protest when Jeremy Corbyn whipped MPs to support the triggering of article 50, Lewis was given the job of examining how a Labour government could champion sustainable economics. He has repeatedly made it clear he regards the issue as a test of political leadership.“I think there’s a crunch point now coming for politics. You often hear there’s no leadership in politics – and this isn’t a leadership pitch, I promise you – but when you talk about leadership, there’s leadership in different forms,” he said.On red meat, for example, Lewis said: “I’m not going to sit here and say, yeah, let’s ban red meat … but you can show leadership by asking, well actually, is it right that we publicly subsidise an industry that is contributing so much to greenhouse gas emissions, and often is a very unsustainable practice?”He said the government’s role should be to “encourage people and show leadership as to how we’re going to shift people’s eating habits on to a more sustainable footing”.On air travel, he said Labour was starting to come up with options, including a tax “escalator”, which would have the biggest impact on frequent fliers, who tend to be the wealthiest.In a wide-ranging interview, Lewis also mused about everything from the four-day week to universal basic income, and how to ensure the rapid technological innovation of the “fourth industrial revolution” benefits the wider public.While many such policies are at an early stage of development, Lewis said the next Labour manifesto should be significantly different to the previous one.“The 2017 manifesto gave a lot of people a kind of warm, cuddly glow, and it was a great reset of our values and where we are, but it was a base on which to build,” he said. “The next manifesto needs to be a radical manifesto, which builds on the reset, and is 21st-century socialism in action. There’s a hunger for that.”McDonnell has asked the former head of the civil service Bob Kerslake to examine how to rework the Treasury green book – the manual for government spending decisions.Lewis said he hoped environmental sustainability could be incorporated into Whitehall thinking as part of that review.“What we want to do is open out how the Treasury looks at spending and revenue, and looks in a longer term, more holistic and sustainable way – and that is radical.”Lewis recently secured £17,500 from inidual donors to fund his work on sustainable economics, giving him a measure of independence from the party machine.He argued that developing a more sustainable economic model could allow Britain to take a leadership role in the world after Brexit.“Leadership and punching above your weight doesn’t necessarily always have to mean gunboat diplomacy and bombing other countries into the stone age. It can actually mean leading by example, and helping other countries,” he said.Lewis was widely considered a rising star on the left of the party when he arrived in parliament in 2015, and was catapulted on to the frontbench by Corbyn, as many more experienced MPs refused to serve or were sent packing.But the former army reservist and TV reporter does not fit the mould of a career politician and has repeatedly charged headlong into controversy. In 2016, as shadow defence secretary, he clashed with Corbyn’s close aide Seumas Milne over last-minute changes to a party conference speech.In late 2017, he apologised after video footage emerged of him using the phrase “get on your knees, bitch” at a party conference fringe event, and was then suspended – and cleared – over accusations that he groped a party member.Most recently, Lewis was criticised after miming putting a gun in his mouth during a debate in the House of Commons as a Conservative MP interrupted his frontbench colleague Anneliese Dodds.Lewis, who postponed his wedding to defend a wafer-thin majority in the 2017 general election, and recently became a father for the first time, said he found the BBC documentary Blue Planet too unsettling to watch.“I couldn’t watch BP for a long time, until I started doing this job, because I knew in my heart that Blue Planet, as beautiful as it was, at the end they would always have the human impact, and I struggled to watch it because I felt so powerless,” he said.He said he believed countering the human threats to the environment would have to mean junking “the obsession with flat-screen TVs and consumption”.“On their deathbed, do people think: ‘I wish I’d spent more time with my Ferrari’? Or do they say: ‘I wish I’d spent more time watching my kids grow up, I wish I’d spent more time country walking’?“It’s about the things that matter in life, and how we have an economy that better reflects that,” he said.On Brexit, meanwhile, Lewis stuck rigidly to the party line, dismissing questions about what Labour would put in its manifesto if there were to be a snap general election as “hypothetical”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c384d370f416f2cae89b854923249df76a22a81/0_87_5077_3046/master/5077.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee99519d9f8cebcdc2de0971ae9f27c7","title":"new horizons heads for flyby of space rock ultima thule","story":"New Horizons expected to have encountered Ultima Thule space rock on edge of solar systemA Nasa probe is believed to have performed the most distant flyby in history in the early hours of New Year’s Day, barrelling past a space rock called Ultima Thule on the outer edge of the solar system.Unless gremlins intervene, the New Horizons spacecraft will have zoomed by the cosmic body at 5.33am GMT and snapped thousands of photographs of the dark, icy body as it speeds on into the void.Ultima Thule lies 4bn miles from Earth in the Kuiper belt, a band of dwarf planets, space rocks and icy debris left over from the formation of the solar system 4.6bn years ago.New Horizons is so distant that mission scientists had no way of helping out with any last-minute glitches. Instead any final troubleshooting will have to have been handled by the probe’s onboard software.“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” said Hal Weaver, a research professor at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland and a project scientist on the New Horizons mission. “This is another great step in the exploration of our solar system.”In 2015, New Horizons flew past Pluto and captured a stunning series of photographs of the dwarf planet’s surface. The images revealed Pluto to be a world where nitrogen mountains tower above the ground and volcanoes erupt ice into a thin hydrocarbon atmosphere.After the Pluto encounter, Alan Stern, the principal investigator on New Horizons, asked Brian May, the Queen guitarist and astrophysicist, if he would compose a track to celebrate the Ultima Thule flyby.“I did scratch my head for a while,” said May. “The name is quite hard to conjure with. But then it came to me that this is about man’s desire to reach out into the universe and explore, and see things that have never been seen before.”The New Horizons track, May’s first solo single for two decades, included a message from Stephen Hawking and was premiered at the New Horizons control centre at Johns Hopkins University shortly before the flyby. “It’s been very exciting. I feel like I’m on that thing,” May said. “To me, it’s about the human spirit and reaching out to discover where we are and why we are here.”In what promised to be the briefest of cosmic encounters, New Horizons was lined up to hurtle past the 20-mile-long Ultima Thule at 31,500mph and get as close as 2,200 miles. Once the probe has gathered all the information it can, it will beam images back to Earth, but even travelling at the speed of light, the data will take six hours to reach home.In recent weeks scientists on the New Horizons team have scoured pictures from the spacecraft’s Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (Lorri) for signs of trouble ahead. At such speed, a particle the size of a grain of rice could knock out the spacecraft.“We’ve looked pretty hard for hazards and we haven’t seen anything to be concerned about, so we are sticking with our primary trajectory,” said Weaver. If the team had spotted dust rings around Ultima Thule, the spacecraft would have been nudged on to a more cautious trajectory that would have taken it further from its target.Mission controllers will not know if the flyby has gone well until engineering data from the probe is beamed back after it has passed Ultima Thule. The probe’s software should respond to most glitches, such as an instrument suddenly drawing too much current or cosmic rays upsetting the computer.Little is known about Ultima Thule, or MU69 to use its official name. But based on preliminary observations, scientists think it may resemble a giant peanut with two large lobes fused together. The dark rock may contain frozen carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, molecular nitrogen and methane, which may be exposed by impact craters on the surface.While some comets that streak through the solar system are thought to have originated in the Kuiper belt, those as distant as Ultima Thule have remained on the outer edges of the solar system since birth. For this reason it is thought that objects such as Ultima Thule, the so-called cold classical Kuiper belt objects, look the same today as they did at the dawn of the solar system.“We’ve never explored a body as primordial or as far away from the sun as Ultima Thule,” said Mohamed Ramy El Maarry, a New Horizons science team collaborator and lecturer at Birkbeck, University of London. “This gives us a chance to look at what comets are like before they enter the inner solar system. They’ve been in deep freeze since they formed 4.6bn years ago.”He added: “What’s really exciting is we expect to see surprises. We are really looking at the basic ingredients of the solar system. This can tell us a lot about the building blocks of the solar system, about the conditions when the solar system formed, and about other solar systems as well.”The first images to be beamed home from Ultima Thule will be small and grainy, but a day or two after the encounter, Nasa hopes to have more impressive pictures from the probe. “This is the first time we’ll fly past a cold classical Kuiper belt object and really see what it looks like,” said Weaver. “We’re taking our first steps into this whole new zone of the solar system. We’re on our way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17d718e06c7558f45b1df407e4b61ba14ad77a64/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa2f317b6f14a94c6bbe37d64993d2f0","title":"foundling museum london bedrooms exhibition highlights child poverty","story":"Bedrooms of London exhibition captures children’s spaces in bedsits and hostelsSome of them resemble cells while others are striking because of their lack of toys, space and privacy. All of them are children’s bedrooms, or at least the space they sleep in, exhibited in photographs displayed by the Foundling Museum, in London.More than 30 pictures by Katie Wilson expose the dispiritingly grim living conditions of families in poverty and form Bedrooms of London, an exhibition that could be one of the most challenging of 2019. “There is something very haunting about the images,” said Caro Howell, the director of the museum. “It is the absences, the absence of space for a child to walk in, or learn to walk in, or play in. The absence of toys, the absence of privacy. Because the people are not there, the environment is speaking for them, they are very haunting.”The photographs will be shown alongside first-hand narratives of the families. There is, for example, the tiny hostel bedsit of Amelie, a baby’s cot next to the mother’s sofabed and no room for the child to crawl then there is the story of Sainey, 32, who went to London aged 15 as a domestic slave, never left, and cannot work because she is in the country illegally and cannot afford clothes for her growing children.“Bedrooms are supposed to be a place of comfort and emotional safety and love,” said Howell. “A child’s bedroom is supposed to be a physical manifestation of the love that those surrounding it feel. Seeing the images brings you up short.”The project is the outcome of two years’ engagement with families by the the Childhood Trust, a London charity that is also producing a book and report to send to policymakers.The trust’s chief executive, Laurence Guinness, said some of the hostels in which people were forced to live were like open prisons. “It’s like you’re living in a cell. You can go out whenever you like but you’ve got no money to go and do anything. You can’t really escape, people are trapped.”When they set out on the project they assumed most children would have their own bedroom. “Even a child poverty charity can be naive about child poverty,” he said. “Those at the very bottom don’t even have a bedroom any more.”The exhibition will be at the museum which is dedicated to the history of the Foundling hospital, founded by Thomas Coram in 1739 as “a hospital for the maintenance and education of exposed and deserted young children”.Guinness said he hoped the photographs would be shown in parliament, where policymakers can take action.But while the families featured in the photographs were down, they were not out, he said. “We got them together recently to let people comment on the pictures and the report. They were very motivated to help.“The overriding question was: ‘How can this create any change?’ That’s all we’re interested in is change. We are not defeated yet.”• Bedrooms of London at the Foundling Museum, 8 February-5 May 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c46a9bf31bba2d6a162faf38a2bcba74ec3b26a4/0_62_2800_1679/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7edb67c15f5387ce9f6ba8ee13afc126","title":"andy murray class return tennis james duckworth brisbane international","story":"The former world No 1 easily beat James Duckworth in Brisbane but swift changes in direction no longer come naturallyAlmost a year to the day since he sat alone in a Brisbane hotel room for more than 10 hours contemplating his future, Andy Murray survived another comeback, with an encouraging and impressive straight-sets win over the Australian wildcard James Duckworth.However, the former world No 1 knows – and all the evidence confirms – he has some way to go before he can challenge seriously for major honours. Only two of his five wins from 12 matches in 2018 were against top 20 players, and now he faces world No 16 Daniil Medvedev in the second round of the Brisbane International.This is a place he feels comfortable, though, having won the title twice and where he remains unbeaten in 10 matches. He would love another win, but his focus must remain on his performance, which was too good for the world No 234, who lost to him in four sets in the first round of the US Open in September.Murray quit the Tour after losing to Fernando Verdasco – in the second round at Flushing Meadows, then in the quarter-finals in Shenzhen. It was the end of a troubled campaign, which stuttered before it even began when Murray pulled out of this tournament to have hip surgery in Melbourne.Before winning 6-3, 6-4 in an hour-and-a-half on Tuesday, Murray had told reporters: “I think last year I was in more pain than I am just now … I’ve had a year of going through quite a lot, so I’ve accepted where I am, and how I’m going to feel. Last year, I was hoping I was going to get much, much better. Then I ended up having surgery and I didn’t know exactly what was going to happen. That was tough, but I want to try to enjoy myself over here. I missed playing here last year. I’m going to go out and compete as hard as I can.”Afterwards, his on-court verdict was more emotional, admitting he did not know what the future held for him in the sport. “It’s not easy to sort of sum up in one sentence or one answer,” he said. “It’s been a really hard 18 months, a lot of ups and downs – it’s been tricky to just get back on the court competing again.“So I’m happy I’m back out here again. I want to just try and enjoy playing tennis as long as I can. I don’t know how much longer it’s going to last but we’ll see.“I thought I did quite well. For the first match of the new year after quite a long break, it was all right.”Still, Murray looked at least top-30 class – as Roger Federer described his form in the spluttering return he attempted last summer. While that is good enough to beat the likes of Duckworth, Murray will have to stretch his sinews and his will against Medvedev, the 22-year-old Russian who won three times on Tour last year and is seeded fourth in the draw. They have never met.Mentally, Murray has been in upbeat mood in the company of his peers in Brisbane, celebrating New Year’s Eve with a smile on his face behind ridiculous glasses.Physically, it remains a different story, illustrated by his post-match comments. After operating on Murray at St Vincent’s Hospital in Melbourne last January, John O’Donnell, the surgeon who saved his career, told Channel7 News: “I’m sure if anyone can do well after this kind of surgery, Andy can, because he’s the most motivated person you’d ever meet.”At the weekend, O’Donnell, who has known Murray for a decade, admitted for the first time that Murray will have to live with the hip pain for the rest of his life. “He’s been walking a tightrope for some time,” he told BBC Sportsweek.“It had reached a point where he couldn’t play. It wasn’t really at a stage where we could attempt to make his hip normal, it was just to try and make it as much better as we could. He’s certainly improved but he still has ongoing problems with it. It’s just his intense desire to do well that’s kept him going as well as he has.”That level did not disappoint in Brisbane. Duckworth tested Murray’s mobility forward and sideways – and at least in hunting down drop-shots, the Scot was superb. He saved four of five break points with his familiar scrambling energy and got his first break point of the match with a charge to the net and delightful crosscourt chip. He sealed the break by forcing a limp response from the Australian, but dropped his own serve immediately – still a bad habit – then broke twice again for a solid win.There remains concern about his lateral movement, and that is something he is going to have to live with. The better players will be merciless in exploiting the obvious trouble he has in switching direction across the baseline, which was always one of his strengths. If he can adapt his game to minimise those moments of stress, he will have to attack more to kill the point before it grows into an old-fashioned war of attrition.The days of grinding are surely gone for Murray. While O’Donnell has obviously done an excellent job on reshaping his hip to alleviate the pain and allow him improved movement, the limp looks permanent. Murray will have to find another way to win at the highest level. In Brisbane on Tuesday, the first day of a new year, he showed he is up for the fight. Whether he can reproduce enough consistency against better opposition than Duckworth even Murray does not yet know.As ever, he will keep us all in a state of animated suspense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31c6ae763101191e16e74f99665a8312288aeb8b/1521_1054_1972_1183/master/1972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28cdc5b39a1facda20928e0cbc99748f","title":"ecb one day cricket world cup the spin","story":"It was a coincidence that the MCC scheduled its winter 1918 committee meeting on 12 November, though if pressed Lord Hawke might have professed it presentiment and canny planning. Either way, on the very first day after the armistice, the MCC’s ordinary committee got together to get on with the business of organising the next domestic schedule. They had a lot to talk about. Through four years of war, there had been no county cricket at all. Now it was back, no one seemed to agree exactly what it should be. Opinion was split. On the one side were the reactionaries, on the other, the reformists.Which is a row that seems to have been around as long as the game itself. The old joke is that the English invented cricket to give themselves some conception of eternity, but really they did it so they’d have something to bicker about during it. There’s always talk that something must be done. And occasionally something actually is, something more than the constant tinkering and tampering with schedules and formats that means no two seasons ever seem to be quite alike, something significant, like the launch of the Sunday league or the T20 trophy.In 1919, the Bolsheviks wanted to enlarge the stumps, extend the overs, and expand the playing hours, to cover the pitches, cut the matches, shrink the bats, reduce the playing days, and limit the number of professional players. Someone even suggested they ban all the left-handed batsmen, just to save the minutes wasted changing the field over. A century before Twenty20, the Observer argued the MCC should organise three-hour county matches, because “the normal attendances on the county cricket grounds would be doubled after the tea interval if spectators were assured 90 minutes of healthy hitting”.The MCC did what any good English institution would in such circumstances, and set up yet another committee to investigate. It was a stormy winter, with much frothing, seething and spluttering. At the national papers, over-worked letters editors must have consoled themselves with dreams of what they might buy with all the overtime they were earning. Eventually, the pronouncement came down that all matches would now last two days rather than three, and that playing hours would be stretched till 7.30pm, “to give workers an opportunity of seeing more of the game”. Everything else would remain the same, except for tea, which, in the most drastic step yet, would now be taken on the field “to save time”.So 1919 was one of the great revolutionary seasons in the history of English cricket. And now, 100 years later, we’re about to have another. Two, in fact, back-to-back. This time, the outbreak of reformist zeal is an overdue attempt to blow the game out the doldrums its been in for the last decade, when participation has dropped, and public enthusiasm dwindled. The remedies the ECB has come up with now are even more radical than the MCC’s 1919 plan to speed up the tea break.Between this April and September 2020, there will be a World Cup and the Ashes, as well as an overhaul of the county championship, and the launch of a new format, The Hundred. There can’t have been a run of summers quite like it.The ECB has been building towards these two seasons for the last four years. It’s restructured the central contract system to make sure limited-overs players were earning as much, or more, as Test match specialists, and encouraged players to prioritise the IPL. They hired Trevor Bayliss, because, as their old director of cricket Andrew Strauss said over and again back then, he was such a good limited-overs coach. And it’s stuck with him since, even while the Test team stalled, because the ODI side was playing better than ever.The county championship, meanwhile, was stripped of its star players and shunted away from high summer so that everyone could play limited-overs cricket when the sun was out. Next year, it will change again. The 50-over competition is crammed into May, the T20 Blast final jammed into late September, and the championship split into chunks and spread out around the out-grounds to make room for the World Cup. The ECB at least had a good argument for doing all this, even if it wasn’t one everyone liked. The tournament is, as CEO Tom Harrison has said, a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity. Whisper it, but it feels like the ECB is well set to take advantage of it.Then there’s The Hundred. This has so far infuriated millions of people who like cricket, but, we’re told, will appeal to the many more millions who don’t, yet, but might if only it didn’t resemble cricket so much. The ECB has blown through £65m in cash reserves in the last two years, and the cost of launching the new competition has ballooned to more than £40m. This is why it’s also had to make so many cuts. And cuts mean compromises, mainly to its development programmes. The overseas placement scheme’s been scrapped and so has its specialist pace and spin bowling projects.In 1919, by the way, the new dawn of English cricket turned out to last just half a season. That August, the MCC scrapped the new two-day format and by 1920, everything was back as it had been in 1914. A century later, these latest changes won’t be so easily undone. The ECB has staked almost everything on England making a run to the final of a home World Cup in 2019, and the newly enthused public falling in love with The Hundred in 2020. Right now, the first proposition looks a better bet than the second, but the ECB can’t really afford to be wrong about either.• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

But he criticised what he called a minority who, he said, claimed to be the voice of the people but were in fact “megaphones of a hateful crowd who have lashed out at elected politicians, security forces, journalists, Jews, foreigners, homosexuals”.Macron said this hatefulness was “the negation of France” and that “our future depends on our capacity to love each other and to love our nation.” He said he had “seen the unthinkable and heard the unacceptable” in recent weeks and that “order” in France would be maintained.Macron spoke as more than 147,000 security forces were mobilised across the country for new year’s celebrations, not just because of the terrorist threat in France but also because authorities feared surprise demonstrations by anti-government protestrs.About 300,000 tourists and revellers were expected on the Champs Élysées on New Year’s Eve for Paris’s annual light show, which is projected on to the Arc de Triomphe and was the target of protesters this month. A security cordon was set up around the area from 4pm and security guards and police checked those who entered. Some gilets jaunes demonstrators called for peaceful protests in Paris.Over the past decade, hundreds of cars have been set alight on the edge of French cities including Strasbourg and Lyon on New Year’s Eve in what has become a kind of end-of-year ritual. But officials said security services were on alert for unannounced anti-government protests in order to prevent violence.The gilets jaunes movement, named after protesters’ hi-vis vests, began in November as a tax revolt against a new fuel duty. It has morphed into a nationwide protest against what has been seen as an unfair and unjust tax policy, and Macron’s measures favouring businesses and the wealthy. Rioting, arson and running battles with police have occurred on the edge of demonstrations in Paris and other cities.In his new year speech, Macron acknowledged the anger that had spread across France and tried to empathise. But he said it had been brewing for a long time – implying he did not accept the blame but instead laid responsibility on decades of mass unemployment and what he has called years of political stagnation.Macron tried to channel the positivity of the anger, saying it “showed us that we’re not resigned to anything, that our country wants to build a better future”.He was careful to use the words “us” and “we” to avoid appearing cut off from the public mood. After he was mocked for the staid style of a recent televised speech aimed at calming the protests, which was delivered seated  at a desk in a gilded room, this time Macron stood up in a more modern room in the Élysée Palace.After some in Macron’s shrinking supporter base feared he would step back from his manifesto promise of structural reforms because of the unrest, the president went on the offensive, vowing to press on with his plans to overhaul the social welfare state and social protection in 2019, beginning with changes to unemployment benefits.He said of his changes so far, including loosening of labour laws: “The results can’t be immediate, and impatience – which I share – can’t justify any kind of giving up.” He repeated his argument that unbridled, lawless “ultra free-market” capitalism was at its end, suggesting he wanted to reinvent a new form of responsible globalisation in a Europe that “protects”.Macron said one of his key wishes for 2019 was “truth”, including a fight against inaccurate information online. This suggested that Macron might seek to go further on regulating information online, after his government passed a law which aims to empower judges to order the immediate removal of news deemed as fake during election campaigns. He did not give details.Gilets jaunes demonstrators have called for referendums and a greater role for citizens in everyday politics. Macron said “our institutions must continue to evolve” but didn’t spell out any possible changes to the political system. He has promised to launch a national debate from January and said only that he would write to citizens to set out the parameters in coming days.The European elections in May will be a major test for Macron’s political party, La République En Marche, which is behind Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally in the polls. Macron said in his speech that he would soon set out a project for Europe.He is also again under pressure over the scandal of his former bodyguard and security aide, Alexandre Benalla, who was sacked this summer after he was filmed acting violently to demonstrators.The Benalla affair was back in the headlines this week over the former aide’s continuing use of diplomatic passports. He also claimed he had remained in personal contact with Macron. The affair has proved damaging in part because of the Elysée’s botched handling of it, making statements that were contradicted and giving the impression of a cover-up. The Elysée on Monday dismissed his claims as invented."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09959987445d9d2b3cc7418cd439e3613bfd4e47/45_122_762_457/master/762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f567e349601df369705fdde79fe7aa2","title":"us man detained in russia is former marine says family","story":"Paul Whelan was in Moscow for friend’s wedding when he was held for spying, says brotherThe American man who was detained in Russia on accusations of being a spy is a retired marine who was visiting Moscow to attend a wedding, according to his family.In a statement released on Tuesday morning, the family of Paul Whelan said the last time anyone had contact with him was on 28 December, the night before the wedding he was due to attend.Russia’s domestic security service announced on Monday that it had arrested an American on Friday who was “carrying out an act of espionage”. A statement in Russian did not provide further details about the inidual who was detained or information about the alleged spying, but his name appeared to translate as Paul Whelan.The US state department declined to comment on whether the detained inidual was a former marine, but in response to a question from the  it said it was aware that a US citizen had been detained, had been notified of his detention by the Russian ministry of foreign affairs, and said it was seeking access to the inidual.“Due to privacy considerations, we have no additional information to provide at this time,” the department said.In an email to the , Whelan’s twin brother, David, said Whelan was attending the wedding of a fellow former marine, who was marrying a Russian woman.Whelan’s family said he had been to Russia “numerous times”, as far back as 2007, and was currently working on a corporate security team for Borg Warner, which is listed online as a Michigan-based maker of automative industry components.David Whelan said his brother had previously been to Russia as a visitor and for his work for Kelly Services, a management consultancy. could not immediately verify the accuracy of the family’s statement.Whelan’s previous trips to Russia, his brother said, were only for short visits and he had limited Russian language abilities “other than to be able to get around”.“This visit was entirely for pleasure, from what I understand,” his brother said.The family said they had learn of Whelan’s arrest on Monday after reading the news reports.“We noticed that he was not in communication on the 28th, which was very much out of character for him even when he was traveling,” the family said. “We are deeply concerned for his safety and wellbeing. His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected.”It is not clear whether any US officials have seen Whelan since his arrest. The family said they had been in contact with their congressional representatives, the US embassy and the state epartment, where many officials were on furlough due to the US government shutdown.The family said they believed a 72-hour window for the US government to be able to visit Whelan had already started and they had not been in contact with anyone who had seen or been in contact with Whelan since 5pm (Moscow time) on 28 December.“We are hoping he will be able to return home soon,” the family said.The wedding party had been staying at the pol hotel in Moscow.Whelan’s arrest came just weeks after a Russian national named Maria Butina pleaded guilty to secretly acting as a Russian agent in the US. It is not clear whether Whelan’s detention was an attempt to retaliate for Butina’s arrest, which was a sore point in US-Russian relations."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoSerious concern\u0026rsquo at sharp increase in the number of pedestrian deaths on roadsJust one second separated babies born at Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda, and the CoombeAdrienne Cullen campaigned for a no gagging clause policy in hospitals across Europe\u0026lsquoThe logical time to reshuffle the Cabinet is after the Local and European elections\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute arrest two men, aged 44 and 18, following the incidentMan discharged himself shortly after arriving at Connolly Hospital in BlanchardstownDesigner dogs can sell for more than \u0026euro36,000 each, Dogs Trust Ireland saysThousands attend Dublin\u0026rsquos New Year\u0026rsquos Eve festival with pyrotechnics and light showsMy Options will provide the names of GPs and hospitals offering abortion servicesVaradkar also signals intention to reshuffle Cabinet after local and European elections in MayMore than 10,000 people, including 3,000 children, granted Irish citizenship in 2018Missing from home since December 25th and today failed to attend Coombe hospital appointmentGrieving daughter Nadia pays tribute to mother and friend \u0026lsquoinspired by generosity\u0026rsquoHarris says 2019 legislative priority to make female contraception more widely availableDeparture comes several months prior to end of Bishop O\u0026rsquoReilly\u0026rsquos term as prelateCases are latest against the HSE alleging lengthy delays in having needs assessedFormer  literary correspondent died in crash on December 23rd\u0026lsquoIt will help the women think \u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom not on my own\u0026rsquo and... will scare other people to have their smears\u0026rsquoApplications from England, Scotland and Wales up by more than a fifth since 2017"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3745284.1546354760!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maeve is first irish baby of 2019 born seconds past midnight","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Maeve was born at 3 seconds past midnight  on New Year’s Day, making her the first baby born in Ireland in 2019.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Harry\u0026#39s birth name Henry hits top spot but Meghan is nowhere to be seenPerhaps  readers have been inspired by the Royal wedding. Henry - Prince Harry’s birth name - has risen to the top of the charts for baby boys, according to  birth announcements.The name Henry shares top place with Arthur among  readers. Margot, a lowly 12th in 2017, and Matilda are joint top of the girls’ list.Henry rose to top from third last year, possibly on the strength of Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle in May. The order of service, made public on the eve of the wedding, listed the groom under his official title His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales.Matilda The Musical, based on Roald Dahl\u0026#39s bookRoyal names dominate the boys’ list. After Henry and Arthur in the  readers’ popularity stakes comes Edward, William and George.Girls’ names are not seemingly on Royal message. There are no Meghans - in fact there hasn’t been a Meghan with that spelling since 2001 - and no Kates or Catherines in the top 30. There was a Queen Matilda on the English throne - she was married to King Stephen - but you have to go back almost 900 years.Margot Robbie on the red carpetMore likely Matildas are being named after Roald Dahl’s heroine, now hugely popular in an award-winning musical, while the incidences of Margot is trickier to explain. The Australian actress Margot Robbie, one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, is one possible explanation.Susan Cole, a retired librarian, from Sutton, Surrey, who has been compiling the list for almost 50 years since 1969, said: “Henry now tops the list but Harry doesn’t even make the top ten. Surprisingly Harry comes in at only 21st, well below Henry.”Ms Cole suggested that the Royal wedding - and the prominent use of the name Henry on the order of service - could have swung it among more traditional  readers. The shortened Harry, by contrast, appears passe.The girls’ list contains some unusual names high up including Ottilie at joint third and Cosima just outside the top ten.Top 10 Boys’ names announced in the Please review our commenting policyThousands march in Hong Kong for democracy and independence from China Leak on International Space Station blamed on \u0026#39botched repair job\u0026#39Man drives car into group of migrants in Germany in suspected xenophobic attackIndian PM strips islands of British colonial names - and renames them after freedom fighterBelgium to brew first non-alcoholic \u0026#39abbey beer\u0026#39 as monks tipple threatened by healthy living revolution10-month-old baby girl rescued from collapsed Russian apartment block where more than 30 remain missingMan crashes car into crowd in TokyoDoctor Who: the 10 best Dalek storiesThe mystery of Mrs Brown\u0026#39s Boys: how did a show nobody likes become so popular?Theresa May uses New Year\u0026#39s speech to push her Brexit dealComment: Let 2019 be the year Brexiteers help Britain turn the tide of history and rediscover true democracySajid Javid backs down over migrants as two more boats redeployed to the Channel Comment: Why should Britain offer asylum to people who would rather not make their home in France?The \u0026#39tanker mafia\u0026#39 using illegal hydrants to sell drinking water on the black market in parched KarachiComment: As New Year\u0026#39s resolutions go, nothing beats the will to loaf, \u2028munch and sleepNew Horizons: Nasa spacecraft makes historic flyby of Ultima Thule four billion miles away Bed blocking cost in Scottish NHS hits £500 million since Nicola Sturgeon became First MinisterMore than 15,000 Scots miss out on university place as SNP government \u0026#39cap\u0026#39 criticisedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/03/TELEMMGLPICT000180409668_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDLyVoJxGJQ4iGYZVZw1qGnj3KXGd6R-OklMDNS15Wz8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"iran hosts taliban peace talks eyeing opening us drawdown","story":"Head of Political Office of the Taliban Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanakzai, left, attends the second round in Moscow last yearThe Taliban discussed Afghanistan\u0027s post-occupation situation with Iran in their latest meeting, the group said Tuesday, as Tehran makes a more concerted and open push for peace ahead of a possible US drawdown.The remarks come after Iran confirmed Monday that the Taliban had visited Tehran for a second round of talks in just a few days that are aimed at ending the 17-year conflict.The Taliban delegation discussed with Iran the post-occupation situation, restoration of peace and security in Afghanistan and the region, the militants said in a statement posted on social media and emailed to journalists.It signals a growing confidence among the Taliban for US troops to pull out of Afghanistan, after US officials last month told various media outlets that President Donald Trump had decided to slash the number of boots on the ground.There have been reports in the past of talks between Iran and the Taliban, but they have typically been denied by Tehran.Afghan National Army soldiers stand guard at a checkpoint ahead of parliamentary elections, in Kabul, AfghanistanTehran\u0027s peace push will be viewed with concern by hawks in Washington, who fear that Trump\u0027s planned withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan will cede regional influence to Iran.The Taliban also met with the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in the United Arab Emirates earlier in December as part of a flurry of diplomatic efforts to end the war.But the Taliban refused to meet a delegation from Afghanistan.

After the highs of 2017, which saw the price of bitcoin surge to $20,000 (£15,700), the world\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrency is currently trading close to its lowest point in 16 months.Bitcoin has fallen\u0026nbspby 3 per cent over the last 24 hours, adding to losses of 5 per cent in the last week, 10 per cent in the last month and almost 80 per cent over the last year – leaving little doubt\u0026nbspthat last year\u0027s peak was indeed the result of an over-inflated bubble.There have been five major price spikes in bitcoin\u0027s 10 year history, and after each previous crash the market has managed to recover to even higher levels. But the scale of the 2018 losses have left some cryptocurrency experts questioning whether bitcoin will once again see a market turn-around.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPredicting bitcoin\u0027s fortunes in 2019 has therefore ided analysts, with forecasts from high-profile figures within the cryptocurrency industry ranging from a complete capitulation, to a 10-fold increase from today\u0027s price of $3,650.The most radical predictions come from bitcoin cash founder Calvin Ayre and Fundstrat\u0026nbspco-founder Thomas Lee.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearAccording to Ayre, bitcoin will be superseded by a more technologically advanced cryptocurrency that functions better as an actual currency, such as bitcoin cash.On the other end of the scale is Mr Lee, whose predictions about bitcoin have been proved to be wildly optimistic in the past.\u0026nbspAs recently as November, Mr Lee predicted bitcoin would hit $15,000 by the end of 2018, but appears undeterred by more price falls in his\u0026nbspforecast that bitcoin could hit $36,000 in 2019.\u0026nbspThose positive about bitcoin\u0027s future point to\u0026nbsphe general progression of the\u0026nbspcryptocurrency\u0026nbspand blockchain industry over the last 12 months, with one analyst suggesting bitcoin is currently undervalued.Can Norwegian waterfalls stop bitcoin from destroying the planet?In my opinion, now is a great time to purchase bitcoin, blockchain adviser Olver Isaacs told\u0026nbspThe Independent.

FTSE 100 CEOs are falling like skittles FTSE 100 reaches record high as pound sterling drops to 2018 low Nonetheless, The Independent’s fortune tellers are bravely stepping into the breach again having taken a refresher course under Professor Trelawney (Harry Potter fans will know what I mean). We’ve also lined up a panel of worthies from the City. Our sincere thanks to all of them for being such good sports and putting their heads above the parapet.\u0026nbspI’ve changed the rules a bit this year: our panel was told they could vary their predictions based on possible Brexit outcomes, because, well, who could possibly make an accurate prediction for where that will end up?\u0026nbspBut before we get down to business, the usual warning. This feature is designed to be fun. If you’re going to put actual money down, do your own research into stocks and the markets and consider taking professional advice too.As the editor of this feature, I get to go first. That’s not something I relish looking into the fog that surrounds 2019. But here goes.\u0026nbspMarkets are due a rally after this year’s sell off, the FTSE 100 in particular. It’s suffered from the complete lack of appetite for UK assets, something else to thank Brexit for. But it is also worth remembering that it’s dominated by international companies that make most of their money overseas. It means there is real\u0026nbspvalue to be had for the savvy investor, and perhaps a lot. If some kind of Brexit deal is reached, or better still we have a referendum and stay, I’m going for a relief rally (at some point) and an end of year close of 7,200, which I admit might look optimistic. If it’s no deal, then we’re in real trouble. The markets will hate it, so maybe 6,800. Why not worse? If\u0026nbspthe pound really collapses, the UK’s foreign currency earning stocks could start to look absurdly cheap. But I’d advise heading out of the country if you have the option.Stock pick: HSBC (646.9p). CYBG (181.2p) if Brexit is resolvedI’ve no great love for HSBC, which has had a chequered regulatory history in recent years. That said, while it has a big UK business, its most important markets are\u0026nbspin the far east and it reports earnings in US dollars. The third quarter results were unexpectedly good and the shares have climbed since then. But it’s still offering a prospective idend yield of 6 per cent, with no signs that the payout is under any threat. That’s right, 6 per cent. Eventually people will wake up to a number like that. With the UK in turmoil, there are good reasons for investors to look to this most international of banks. If you think Brexit will end well, and the sugar plum fairy actually exists, however, take a look at challenger bank CYBG following its acquisition of Virgin Money. That was a sweet deal and yet the business trades on just six times earnings.\u0026nbspIf this ends better than I expect, its current price\u0026nbspcould look ridiculously cheap this time next year.While global stock markets looked like they were heading in the right direction earlier this year, they’re moving\u0026nbspinto 2019 on a markedly different path. The FTSE 100 hit record highs in May off the back of the weakened pound. However, while sterling continued its decline throughout the rest of the year, it was not enough to sustain the stock market’s strength. The root of all this volatility was, of course, Brexit, and it doesn’t seem like that’s going to be cleared up any time soon.If the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal, the pound is likely to see a crash of its own – but as we now know, that doesn’t necessarily mean a rally for the FTSE anymore. It could head back towards multi-year lows as investors scramble to distance themselves from the UK. Even if Theresa May manages to get some sort of deal through parliament, it will be some time before we know what sort of impact the new arrangement is having.It seems foolish to make any predictions but I’m going to target a FTSE 100 close of 7,000 – which seems wildly optimistic at this point in time.IAG is the owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia, among others. The FTSE 100 company has paid out pretty hefty idends in recent years, and it’s relatively cheap at the moment – the share price was knocked severely by a cyber attack over the summer. Despite concerns that a potential no-deal Brexit could wreak havoc on air travel in the UK, chief executive Willie Walsh has not wavered from his positive outlook and says the company is confident that it will not be harmed by disruption to flying rights – so confident that the group announced a €2.6bn investment plan in November. With oil prices forecast to drop over the next year, fuel costs should be more manageable too.It’s not been a vintage year for global stock markets. Most are lower than where they started. However, that’s the nature of the beast: stock market returns are lumpy. The UK economy continues to limp along, though a pick up in wage growth has been encouraging. Clearly Brexit is the big swing factor when it comes to the year ahead, and until there is some resolution on that front we can expect sentiment to remain febrile.With the FTSE 100, I’m once again going to play the averages (it only works as a strategy if you do it year in year out!) The FTSE adds about 5 per cent a year on average, excluding idends, so from current levels that puts us somewhere near 7,050.Stock pick: Lloyd’s Banking Group (51.85p) assuming\u0026nbspan orderly Brexit.\u0026nbspDiageo\u0026nbsp(2,795p)\u0026nbsp in the event of a disorderly BrexitIn an orderly Brexit outcome my stock pick would be Lloyds Banking Group.\u0026nbsp It currently has a prospective idend yield of around 5.5 per cent. When CEO Antonio Horta Osorio took over in 2011, the bank was making a loss of £260m. Last year it made a £3.5bn profit, yet the share price is lower than when he started. The market is selling down Lloyds because, at best, it doesn’t know what the next year holds for the bank’s profitability while Brexit hangs in the balance. If the UK economy is unscathed we can expect the share price to pick up. In bad outcome, all stocks are likely to come under pressure in the short term. So is the pound. Bets can be hedged a bit by holding an internationally ersified defensive stock like Diageo. The manufacturer of Guinness and Johnny Walker gets most of its revenues from overseas. And let’s face we’ll probably all need a drink in this scenario.Political shenanigans in Westminster and the ongoing negotiations with Brussels mean that offering any sort of forecast for the UK economy in 2019 is a pretty thankless task. You can see the pound going to $1 in the event of a Brexit outcome that markets don’t like and it going back to $1.50 if the negotiations are seen as finally yielding a positive result, so at $1.25 sterling is probably appropriately priced right nowWhen it comes to the FTSE 100 the darkest hour comes before the dawn and with pessimism so pervasive the market may have a better chance of making it to 8,000 by the end of 2019 than many suspect. It is trading at levels last seen in December 2016 and even languishes below the high reached at the climax of the technology bubble in December 1999. As such, a good degree of bad news may already be factored into the valuation of UK assets, especially as the pound is still trading some 13 per cent below where it stood on the day of the EU referendum in June 2016. Unloved often means undervalued and the UK is not expensive relative to its international peers or its own history on an earnings basis.\u0026nbspIt also offers a prospective yield of 4.9 per cent, which beats base rates pretty handily and also outstrips the 1.25 per cent yield of 10-year UK government bonds.I’m normally wary of banks but in the case of the FTSE 250 “challenger”\u0026nbspOneSavings Bank I am prepared to make an exception. The stock trades on barely 6.5 times earnings and 1.4 times book value while offering a idend yield of 4.1 per cent. If everything goes wrong from a political or macroeconomic perspective, the lowly valuation could provide some relative downside protection, while the yield may offer some compensation for the risks involved as investors tough it out. A Brexit deal triggering a rally in sterling, and a resurgence in interest in UK assets, will put stocks like OneSavings Bank in the vanguard of a recovery, especially as loan growth is robust. The firm’s return on equity of 26 per cent is outstanding relative to its peer group. Given the bank’s exposure to mortgages, smaller companies and its strong focus on buy-to-let there are clear risks. Any economic and house price downturn could test sentiment and profits. But the valuation is low.Brexit, Donald Trump’s trade war and budget tensions between Italy, France and eurozone authorities will be major drivers of markets as politics dominates the start of 2019. The future shape of the UK’s relationship with the European Union remains unclear. A chaotic Brexit is likely to result in a fall in the pound, which is positive for the FTSE 100 as the majority of its earnings are generated abroad. However, a sharp rally in sterling could be negative for the index and any gains will be capped. Hopefully Donald Trump will be pushed in the direction of getting some sort resolution with China over the trade dispute so he can declare a “win” sooner rather than later. This will be positive for markets worldwide. The biggest risk is that the US Federal Reserve oversteps the mark and slams the brakes on the US economy too hard. However, there are signs that the central bank may be more doveish than many expected My FTSE 100 prediction: 7,100Growth at this Middle Eastern private healthcare network operator is supported by a strong economy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the rollout of mandatory health insurance in the country. It also benefits from the UAE’s limited corporation tax regime and is expanding into Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Its new joint venture in Saudi Arabia, which will see it become one of the largest healthcare operators in the kingdom, is due to complete in the first quarter of 2019.Andy Brown, head of direct equities, Tilney Asset Management\u0026nbspLooking into next year, in the near term sentiment towards UK shares will depend in large part on what happens between now and the end of March when the UK is set to leave the EU. Many of the big UK political risks appear to be playing out now in the form of a potentially messy Brexit and with doubts about the sustainability of the current UK government. These anxieties are reflected in current UK equity valuations, which at 11 times earnings, are well below other developed markets and their longer-term trend.It’s important not to confuse UK equities and the domestic economy. In fact well over two-thirds of the earnings of FTSE 100 companies in aggregate are made outside of the UK. Currency volatility is likely to remain a feature which will have both an operational and financial impact of many UK companies. Not only are UK equities at discounted valuations, idends remain an attractive feature of the UK market both compared with\u0026nbspother regions and bond yields. We expect the FTSE 100 to eke out small gains by the end of 2019, perhaps finishing at around 7350, but with idends on top.DS Smith is a leading supplier of packaging products with a genuine global presence.

We are not short of key themes to ensure a bumpy ride across the year Trade wars, China slowdown, US Federal Reserve tightening (or not), Brexit and Italy all point to 2018’s volatility continuing if not rising in the year to come.The already challenging task of crystal-ball-gazing is almost impossible heading into 2019. With so much uncertainty surrounding Brexit and just three months to go to the break, perhaps the only certainty for the pound and the FTSE 100 is the continuation of this new uncertain phase.The year just gone has been a nightmare for the FTSE, which is down around 11 per cent this year, despite a 5 per cent drop in sterling. Weakness in the pound is good news for all the international stocks on the FTSE, around 70 per cent of the index itself. However, we expect broader fears of slowing global growth to ramp up across 2019, starting as soon as January with a softer US earnings season.Predictions for the FTSE would need to be split depending on the type of Brexit Theresa May secures. A disorderly, no-deal Brexit could see the pound plummet which would offer more support to the FTSE, as we saw post the Brexit referendum. However, a key difference is that the global economy was in better position in 2016. Under this scenario we envisage a very volatile year with the FTSE ending only marginally higher.A Brexit deal will see the pound recover some ground, adding pressure to the FTSE. A stronger pound, plus growing concerns over global growth would mean a difficult year for the FTSE which could close lower.Making money on stocks in 2019 amid such uncertainty will require careful choices. Gold has not lifted off this year, shedding 5 per cent of its value as a strong US economy and the\u0026nbspFederal Reserve\u0026nbsphiking rates have boosted faith in the dollar. However, with the Fed expected to slow its rate of interest rate rises this year the glitter could return to gold. With the precious metal expected to increase between 5 per cent and 15 per cent miner Randgold Resources will be a stock to watch.It has been a volatile year, although much of this comes off the back of 2017, one of quietest on record. The “synchronised global growth”\u0026nbspidea disappeared fairly early on, and trade wars have certainly not helped matters. The great post-2008 bull market has not come to an end, but it has taken quite a kicking. Things will remain volatile, but some of the bearishness and pessimism is perhaps overdone.If Brexit ends with a dealRemain, then the FTSE\u0026nbsp100\u0026nbspcould hit 7,500, but if no deal 6,000.\u0026nbspThe life insurer has good exposure to Asia, a strong idend, and is reasonably valued. I think this works in both situations.Stephen\u0026nbspAdams, head of equities, Kames CapitalDisorderly Brexit risk, Corbyn risk, earnings risk, monetary policy risk: it is little wonder then that the FTSE 100 is down. Nor is it clear that any of these pressures are abating as we head into the start of 2019. However, on a 12-month view it is possible to see the catalysts for a higher UK equity market.UK equities are the contrarian global asset class,\u0026nbspand any clarity on Brexit short of a no-deal cliff edge would likely be taken well. It is also possible that the economy would enjoy a relief bounce with the release of some pent up demand and a looser fiscal stance. In that scenario I would envisage the FTSE at 7,450 by year end 2019.By mid-year we may also witness a pause in US monetary tightening and a stabilisation in rebased earnings per share forecasts. Even with a no-deal Brexit I could see a FTSE little changed over the year as sterling takes the strain and the high percentage of overseas earnings in the blue chip index receive\u0026nbspa boost on any devaluation, so\u0026nbsp6,800.The deal with Schneider materially enhanced the sales opportunities for Aveva’s world class portfolio of design, engineering, construction and industrial software solutions. Recent updates have proved reassuring and with a significant proportion of the company’s earnings in foreign currency,\u0026nbspAveva would receive translational benefits on any sterling weakness.\u0026nbspBalfour Beatty, meanwhile,\u0026nbsphas undergone a painstaking and protracted period of dealing with underperforming contracts and has emerged with a strong balance sheet, rising margins and resilient cash flows unlike some competitors. As a contractor with a number of UK government contracts the stock should bounce on a Brexit deal and the valuation should see an upward re-rating.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Andy Martin reportsClick to followThe IndependentZia and his Velocity co-founder Alex MacdonaldI was wearing my Kenzo patchwork jacket, my Billabong denim shirt, and a sort of Gareth Southgate waistcoat. And I had slapped on David Beckham\u0026nbspHomme quite liberally. I was taking notes with my Montblanc pen, trying to blend in with supermodels, Premiership footballers\u0026nbspand hedge fund manager types\u0026nbspat a snazzy restaurant in the upmarket Tribeca neighbourhood of Manhattan. Because I was having a power breakfast with Zia Yusuf, co-founder and CEO of Velocity. And if you’re worrying about how much it costs to join, then it’s probably not for you. “And your membership name is?” said the exceptionally charming hostess at the door. For a brief while, I was living the dream. Even the smashed avocado on toast seemed like the best smashed avocado I’d ever tasted. Likewise the coffee. And the cutlery and the napkins were outstanding too. “My mum told me not to buy nice things,” Yusuf says, “because you always lose them.” Velocity doesn’t do things, it does experiences. In an exclusive way. For “premium consumers”. “We treat members as human beings,” said Yusuf, “not very rich people.”Yusuf’s key insight is that even if you’re as rich as Croesus, you still need a digital Jeeves – an all-purpose concierge service – to fix things for you, discreetly, effortlessly, infallibly. I didn’t even try to download the Velocity app. It can probably spot if you’re not a billionaire.A View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityA View from the Top: ViaVan London chief Jess Oppetit A View from the Top: SlimFast boss Lindsay Reisser-WestonA View from the Top: Jacqueline de Rojas on discrimination in techZia Yusuf, 32, did not come from money. Born in a village outside Aberdeen, he is the son of Sri Lankan parents. His father is a paediatrician for the NHS and his mother is a nurse. At the age of 13 he had a moment that he still recalls fondly, when his father came into his room and said, “Do you want to go to Disney World?” He had always wanted to go to Disney in Paris, but his father said, “We’re not going there, we’re going to the original in Florida!” They had scrimped and saved and maxed out the credit card and it was still 10 months in the future – and the young Yusuf was so excited he could hardly sleep for the last month. “But it was something to look forward too. That’s what we try to provide at Velocity. It’s about making you feel like a kid again.”He went to Hampton School, then studied international relations at the LSE. In his final year he signed up for Merrill Lynch, for the sake of “peace of mind”. But this was in 2008. After Lehman Brothers went to the wall he got in touch with the guy who had given him the job, just to make sure everything was still in place. He got an automated message back: “This person is no longer with the company…” Nothing is plain sailing. Everything always goes wrong. Unless, that is, you’re a Velocity member. There’s a story by Kafka of a bloke who goes up to an open door but the doorman keeps him waiting outside for years until he is finally dying and then he slams it shut. Tough. Velocity is like that, but the exact opposite. There’s a guy holding the door open and ushering you through it very respectfully wherever you go. If you’re a member, you’re walking on a red carpet the whole world over. You get the top table at the Ivy or a seat at the Wimbledon final. If you want to go surfing, they’ll arrange the perfect wave, with palm trees and sultry breezes, just for you. If you’re looking for the Holy Grail, it’s here, somewhere on the app. You want the moon? Have it. Have two. You have a dream? Dream no longer. “We’re a tech company,” says Yusuf, pushing a perfect mini-croissant in my direction. “But tech is a means not an end in itself.” The average “basket size” is $2,500. The biggest is $500k – for a single transaction. Client data is sacrosanct. No harvesting or marketing. Trust is paramount. F Scott Fitzgerald reckoned that “the very rich are different from you and me”. Ernest Hemingway replied, “Yes, they have more money.” Yusuf is more of the Hemingway school of thought. It was while at Goldman Sachs that he realised two things. One is that the super-rich have exactly the same anxieties and desires as everyone else. And the other is that they are not “leading crazy lives of hedonistic pleasure”. “They’re obsessed with what they do. They have more capital, but they suffer from time poverty.” Velocity gives them time back again by doing everything for them at the click of a button. Check the app. You want to go and swim with blue whales? It’s done. You want to… and here, glancing through the app, I come across something so sublime that I am not even allowed to say what it is. “As easy as ordering an Uber.” There is no hassle. Hassle has been abolished in the great and glorious realm of Velocity. It is, I have to concede, a wonderful world. Velocity was born in 2014 and launched in public after two years of development. “We (Yusuf and co-founder Alex Macdonald) agreed with Elon Musk – it can’t be slightly better, it’s got to be amazing.” They can do something as simple and sentimental as picking up your grandma at the airport too. And there is a romantic side. They have now arranged 14 full marriage proposals, always in the perfect setting, with (so far) 100 per cent success rate. I imagine they can do orces too, in a beautiful way. Yusuf himself used his own app recently. He had almost forgotten his mother’s birthday. Velocity stepped in and saved the day: a Sri Lankan-style dinner at Hoppers in London. “My Mum is hard to please,” says Yusuf, but she was delighted. “It was a lot better than an e-card.” He’s going to take her on safari the next time.It’s hard not to agree with Yusuf that “the paradox is that we have the ability to go and do more than any generation in history. But our tendency is to order in a pizza and binge on Netflix.” He wants to get busy people out into the real world again – effortlessly. And he stresses a surprisingly ethical dimension to the whole business. It’s not just about arranging meaningful and magical moments, or even matrimony. These experiences can actually make a difference to the wider world because the people having them also have a lot of power. Yusuf cites the case of a CEO who went on a “giraffe collaring” adventure with a team of conservationists. “He came out of it a changed man. His company went green overnight and he killed all single-use plastic cups. And our platform made it happen. Nothing beats an experience for changing your view of the world.” Which is why the velocity.black website has a special section called “impact”. “It all sounds great,” said a hard-working single mother who was giving me a lift later in the day, as I was coming down from Cloud 9. There was just a hint of bitterness in her voice. “I would like to go swimming with whales and tagging giraffes. Can I join?” “Of course you can,” I replied, soothingly. “You just have to win the lottery first.”A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He would ring, to tell me what the weather was like over there, while I was suffering, in grey, wet, chilly London. Or how, he was enjoying some fine, French wine he’d taken specially while sitting with his feet dangling in the warm, balmy sea.Not any more. So far, the phone has lain silent. Although after reading this, he might ring again, as he did in the summer, because I wrote something he did not agree with. Once again, I was treated to a volley of abuse, much of it too crude to repeat here.It’s been a recurring theme of 2018, the PR demise of Sir Philip Green or “PG” as he is known throughout the sector and City. When the year began, he’d still not recovered from the fallout over the sale of BHS to someone who did not have the financial muscle to take on a business of that size, and Green’s subsequent refusal to plug the company’s pension deficit. He did cough up, eventually, and only after much protest.Then, came Oliver Shah’s excellent biography, Damaged Goods: the Inside Story of Sir Philip Green, the Collapse of BHS and the Death of the High Street. It painted a colourful picture of Green, and his swaggering, bruising manner.That was followed by the revelation that Green had gagged former employees from detailing his sexual and racial harassment – claims that he vehemently denies.Finally, Green’s Arcadia group was exposed to what was a horrid shopping season. It certainly was an annus horribilis for him, reputation-wise, not that he would ever reach for a polite Latin phrase as the Queen once famously did – Green would opt for a more Anglo-Saxon wording.Sir Philip Green’s and Simon Cowell business partnership Spare a thought for poor old billionaire Philip GreenSir Philip Green’s net worth and retail empireWhen he looks back on where it all went wrong – to apply some context he remains incredibly wealthy, is still a high street force, retains his knighthood, and became a grandfather, but there’s no doubt he’s suffered – he only has himself to blame.That sense of self, of believing entirely in his own gifts, has propelled him to great heights. He’s a natural, intuitive, aggressive deal-maker, blessed with an uncanny propensity for mental arithmetic. Whether he’s a genius at the longer game of retailing is a moot point. Certainly, he knew how to build an empire, and to keep it buoyant – for a while. But did he read the long-term runes, and foresee the advent of online shopping, and did he exhibit the same fleetness of foot as some of his competitors?Green is not someone who responds constructively to criticism. If the media and politicians attack his convoluted financial arrangements that see the business vested in the name of his wife who lives in Monaco as a way of avoiding tax, he will roar his defiance.A more publicly empathetic person, one who cares deeply about how they’re perceived, who can see that the tax line will dog him constantly and be wheeled out as a weapon to beat him with, might end the arrangement and swallow the resulting hefty bill. But they would regard it as a price worth paying, for better treatment by the press and parliament, for a favourable public standing.Not Green. Similarly, from the off, as soon as the BHS affair blew up, he could have made a payment to cover the pension gap into an escrow account, and leave the lawyers to sort out the fine detail. But he chose not to.He complained that his opponents liked to focus on his extravagant, bling lifestyle. Meanwhile, he would order another superyacht, so that he owned not one, but two. His reasoning was that his spending was none of their concern, that what he did with his money was up to him. He would describe his lavish parties as private, but then call journalists to invite them to listen, down the line, as George Michael did a sound-check.He’s never fully appreciated that he is also a public figure, a modern celebrity, who courted publicity for himself and for his fashion products, who liked to be photographed surrounded by supermodels. In many town centres, his outlets play a vital role, as anchor tenants, central to the wellbeing of the shopping districts and accompanying communities. Green is a major employer, responsible for several tens of thousands of jobs. He cannot have it both ways.As with many kings, his world is also that of a court. His advisers are courtiers, there, possibly, to please not help, to say “can” rather than “can’t”, and “yes” not “no”. It’s questionable, whether his actions and the blows to his image are the result of receiving bad advice, or disregarding good advice and preferring to do his own thing. Whatever the answer, he became badly unstuck in 2018. For that, he was my Man of the Year, but for all the wrong reasons.For anyone looking at how not to manage communications, how to make a bad public relations situation worse, Green’s last 12 months is a textbook tour de force.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film.

The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Pikachu,\u0026nbspnow wearing a Sherlock-Holmes-style deerstalker, refers to himself as a “world-class detective” and urges Tim to partner up with him to find his missing father.It was revealed last year that the Deadpool star would voice Pikachu.Detective Pikachu, which is mostly a live-action movie with the addition of animated Pokémons, is a joint American and Japanese production.“I think we all knew I’d wind up as a miniature detective repeatedly saying the same two words,” Reynolds tweeted when the trailer was released. “Just didn’t think it’d be this soon.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal. And now it appears all of that happened by accident.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Sorry about that, this was supposed to be a very small test but we went broader than we anticipated,” Instagram head Adam Mosseri wrote on Twitter, alongside an awkward-looking emoji. The change went to “a few orders of magnitude more people than intended”, he wrote.He said the change “should already be rolled back”. If it is still appearing, he told users they should “simply restart your app and you should be good to go”, Mr Mosseri advised.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts.

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Once the programme is over, the same service will cost £45 for most phones, and a full £65 for the iPhone X.Apple gives governments increased access to phone dataThe iPhone X recently became eligible for the throttling, which Apple still applies to more strained batteries to ensure they perform properly. One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/01/20/instagram.jpg","title":"new instagram update revert back scrolling swipe left feed change feature","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily. Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen. Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them. Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

This time around, almost everyone got the update within a matter of minutes. If people weren\u0027t seeing it when they opened their app, force quitting and scrolling around appeared to prompt the app to update.Why Instagram just completely changed its feedBut now some users report that the change has switched back, with the feed going upright all over again. It\u0027s not clear whether that is a bug – or whether the rollout itself had happened by accident, or early.Instagram had clearly meant for the update to go live at some point, since an instructional card popped up to explain that the change had been made and what users now had to do.There doesn\u0027t appear to be any way to make the feed change back. Instagram is not giving the option to revert to the old feed, even temporarily.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg  width= 1254  height= 836  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg","title":"samsung galaxy s10 release date price camera specs camera screen leaks","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

It is prepared to take gigabytes of photos and other data during the hours it approaches and departs from its closest point to the 30-kilometre-wide body.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialScientists believe the body is farther away from Earth than any other that has had such a close encounter with a Nasa\u0026nbspprobe.The New Horizons probe was slated to reach the “third zone” in the uncharted heart of the Kuiper Belt at 12:33am eastern time.\u0026nbspNasa prepares to explore most distant world ever probed by humankindScientists will not have confirmation of its successful arrival until the probe communicates its whereabouts via Nasa’s Deep Space Network at 10:28am eastern time, about 10 hours later.\u0026nbspOnce it enters the peripheral layer of the belt, containing icy bodies and leftover fragments from the solar system’s creation, the probe will get its first close-up glance of Ultima Thule, a cool mass shaped like a giant peanut, using seven on-board instruments.According to Nasa, scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched in 2006, meaning the mission was unique. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015.\u0026nbsp“Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons, told reporters on Monday at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland.\u0026nbspLaunched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey toward the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the\u0026nbspplanet.\u0026nbspDuring the fly-by, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Fireworks explode over the Sydney Harbour during New Year\u0027s Eve celebrations in SydneyBangladeshi army personnel drive a military vehicle through a street adorned with election posters near a polling station in Dhaka.

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

Everything up until now – the endless disputes, crises and resignations, the huge cost, both in gold and other reforms forgone, are just a prelude for the tougher task ahead.If the UK leaves the EU this year, it will do so with no blueprint for its future trading terms, after Brussels comprehensively torched the Chequers plan in September.To give one example of the tortures ahead, the Commons would have to decide, in the summer of 2020, whether to implement the Irish border backstop the following January – the key controversy currently obsessing MPs.Created with Sketch.

It will take many more years than that.Even if the UK ever puts forward realistic proposals, trade talks will be held up by MEP elections and the appointment of new commissioners – creating a vacuum ripe for new more Tory Euro-wars.And the alternative to embracing the backstop – the UK staying under EU rules beyond 2020, while paying tens of billions of pounds more for the privilege – is scarcely more appealing.Turn a corner?

And, without our cash, the EU now realises there will be a massive black hole in their coffers.EU chiefs mistakenly thought they had us over a barrel and could use their leverage to get whatever they wanted.But they are now waking up to the fact that Theresa May’s Brexit deal is unlikely to get the nod and, with no deal legally our default position, a clean break looms.The refusal to give our PM any concessions does not look so wise now.The Sun has long questionedthe EU would ever prioritise their economies and citizens’ jobs over a zealous desire to punish Britain for leaving.Perhaps Mr Oettinger’s comments suggest that reality is finally dawning.IT is shocking that Britain has just TWO boats to police , miles of shoreline.Organised gangs are taking advantage of our easily penetrable coast to traffick desperate people who will risk their lives in one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes to get here.As many as  people have tried to cross over from France in just two months. How many more have slipped in under the radar If these people aren’t discouraged from taking such lethal risks then Britain’s beaches and ports will become as tempting as those in Spain and Italy.Our Government must stop more arriving.

Every word of his tweet was correct — these men are sick, they are paedophiles and they are Asian.When politicians are condemned for telling the truth, for stating plain-as-day facts, you know we live in scarily censorious times.So, this week, Javid was right to turn down an invitation to “rethink” his October tweet.He was on the Today programme on Radio . A guest presenter — the British-Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie — asked himhe thought his tweet might have fuelled hate crimes. Coolly, and with rare principle, Javid said that of course politicians must be “careful with their language”.Butyou look at recent high-profile cases of gang-based sexual exploitation, “there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, he said.He’s right.Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Derby, Telford, Newcastle, Huddersfield . . . across England there have been awful grooming-gang cases, where the perpetrators have largely been Muslim men and the victims white working-class girls.We must be free to talk about this. To analyse it. To ask how such a terrible situation came about where vulnerable, mostly white girls are preyed upon by wicked, mainly Muslim men.But we are not free to talk about it. Anybody who raises the issue of Muslim grooming gangs risks being branded as foul, a racist, a troublemaker whose words will fuel hate crimes.Indeed, Javid has been subjected to genuine racist abuse for speaking out on the issue.Vile, hard-left tweeters have denounced him as an “Uncle Tom” and a “coconut”.Such disgusting racist insults reveal where the real prejudice lies in this debate — not in Javid’s concerned comments, but in the PC outrage that effectively says to him: “Shut up, Coconut.” Javid was not being prejudiced but many of the supposed progressives raging against him have been.It is all a sign of the times. From Conservatives such as Javid, to Labour MP Sarah Champion and radical feminists such as Julie Bindel, anyone who expresses concern about Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs can expect to be bombarded with abuse.But a nation that cannot discuss its communal tensions is a nation that is in very serious trouble.That signicant numbers of Muslim men are abusing signicant numbers of white working-class girls suggests “multicultural Britain” is a fractured, sometimes ugly place — and we must be at liberty to talk about this.Shushing debate about Muslim grooming gangs is insulting not only to the victims of those gangs, but to Britain’s Muslim community, too.It suggests they are too fragile, too weak, to cope with honest debate about problems and crimes within their communities.So let us be thankful for Sajid Javid — a politician who is willing to look modern Britain in the face and ask it some dficult but essential questions.This is a Tory to watch.Their latest wheeze is to force restaurants and supermarkets to impose “calorie caps” on their dishes.Public Health England is thinking about stopping supermarkets from selling sarnies that have more than  calories and capping restaurant meals at  calories. This would effectively mean using the power of the state to force us slovenly, greedy plebs to go on diets.It’s so paternalistic.Here’s a radical idea – bugger off and let people eat whatever they want.Our lunchtime triple-decker sandwich and occasional restaurant blowout are none of your business.TALK about a self-fulfilling prophecy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.”The former Luxembourg PM added: “I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May.“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention.”Hitting back last night, a No source said: “What does he hope to achieve by saying this  I don’t know whose interests that serves”.Tory MP Nigel Huddleston dubbed it “not particularly useful or helpful language”, adding: “It is inappropriate but not surprising, as he is under pressure from European businesses to produce a deal as well”.Mrs May has been told by Tories and the DUP to seek legally binding assurances that the backstop that keeps Britain in the customs union will be time-limited.One senior aide to the PM last week dubbed Mr Juncker the UK’s “best hope” of finding a fix as he was “put on this earth to negotiate”.The new row came as International Trade Secretary Liam Fox yesterday warned that the chances of Britain leaving the EU would be down to  Mrs May’s deal is voted down in two weeks time.It also emerged that senior Tory and Labour MPs are planning to force the government to delay Brexit by three monthsthe Commons throws out the deal.It was claimed that cross-party talks have been underway for several weeks to ensure the March  date is put back until July in a bid to win the government more time.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn today accuses Theresa May and her ministers of tipping Britain “into crisis” for leaving the country with no deal with the EU in place with just  days to go today until Brexit takes place.In his New Year message, the Opposition boss attacked the Tories for “the complete mess they’ve made of Brexit, trying to drive through a bad deal and letting people down all across the country whether they voted leave or remain.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The current rate of departures means the House is on track to meet that objective.“The ‘cost per Peer’ quoted by Mr Sheppard is misleading, as it is reached by simply iding the overall budget of the House of Lords, which includes fixed costs such a security, IT infrastructure and the maintenance of the building, by the number of Members. This calculation does not reflect the cost of inidual Members of the House.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004565867632.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brit tourists call up embassies to ask for advice on vampires massages and strictly come dancing","story":"Embassy officials have published a list of the stupidest calls they’ve received in the past year.They included multiple requests for advice on getting married and offers of unwanted puppies.One US-based caller asked the Foreign Office to tell them which celeb had been voted off Strictly the night before.A film buff in the Netherlands phoned the local embassy after watching Braveheart, to ask about some of the movie’s plot details.A British tourist in the Canary Islands demanded consular staff help him persuade his hotel they should give him a dferent room because a stray cat peed on his bed.

It looked like coffee grounds.“At that point I knew something was very wrong.”After she and her husband, Jeremy, transported Beck to the hospital, X-rays showed the boy had eaten the magnets inside his toy, and they had started tearing holes in his intestines.The holes led to an infection and Beck continues to be monitored for infection.There is no word on any long-term issues that he may face after he recovers from this episode.Jenner told WHNT: “The mom guilt is huge because you feel that you failed your child.”Beck is autistic, and typically White says she takes great precaution with his toys.“I dont want another mother or father to go through this. It was such a simple toy,” Jenner added.The American Academy of Pediatricsalso has been warning the public about the dangers of magnetic childrens toys.Former AAP President Fernando Stein in a statement last year: “High-powered magnets have caused unnecessary surgeries, debilitating injuries, irreversible gastrointestinal damage and other lelong health impacts in infants, children and adolescents.“Paediatricians have been ringing an alarm bell about these dangerous magnets since we first recognised the damage they cause, and we urge parents to avoid purchasing them as gts for children during the holiday season.”In a Facebook update, Jenner stated that Amazon took down the magnetic toy product from their site after her story has gone viral.“Amazon has removed the products that were gted to us,” she wrote.“This is a huge win in my book because as you can see it in the original product purchasing it says it age appropriate for babys SMDH.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000458990236-e1546264395558.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sydney harbour bridge new year wrong date","story":"As around one million people attended the event in the Australian city some eagle eyed viewers noticed that organisers flashed up the wrong YEAR after the clock struck midnight.While , fireworks had finished erupting, a projection on the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge read: “Happy New Year !”The embarrassing error was shared on Reddit along with the caption: “We had one job Australia!!

That would bring a bit of common sense and fairness to decision-making when boardroom pay packets are approved,” she said.“The Government should put an end to phoney incentive schemes that reward executives above and beyond the actual results they get.”Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey MP said Labour would go further than “weak Tory fudge”.She said: “Executive pay is running out of control. While the Conservatives’ watered-down regulations will only require large companies to publish pay bands, Labour in government will take decisive action on excessive pay.“Labour is committed to rolling out maximum pay ratios of : in the public sector and in companies bidding for public contracts, because it cannot be right that wages at the top keep rising while everyone ’s stagnates.“Labour will also legislate to reduce pay inequality by introducing an Excessive Pay Levy on companies with staff on very high pay.

Many of these changes will only happen in April , which marks the new tax year. But an important few kick in on New Years Day itself. Heres a quick guide.   Energy giants will finally be banned from charging you more than a set amount from January . The cap - introduced by Theresa May after a long campaign marked by fudges and climbdowns - is set to help the million families on a default tarf. Default tarfs are the ones you end up onyou choose not to switch, ora fixed-term tarfs comes to an end and you dont pick a new one. Ofgem set the cap in November at pound, a year for a typical dual fuel customer who is paying by direct debit.

Except its not, because January  is only the day the pay gaps start being recorded. They will only be actually published in . The way of measuring ratios has also come under fire, because it doesnt look at the lowest-paid staff, such as cleaners. Low-paid staff are also sometimes outsourced, leading to fears they could be left out of the figures.   EU rules on fishing are coming into effect on New Years Day - and a watchdog has warned they could have a devastating impact on the UKindustry. The landing obligation forces boats to bring fish caught beyond their quotas to shore, instead of throwing them back into the sea. After a four-year phasing-in period, it comes into effect in full on January . The aim is to conserve fish stocks by encouraging fishermen to be more selective about what they catch. But the law has been branded badly designed by UK fishermen because it could clog up busy harbours with extra beauracracy.

CPS director Robert Colvile said:“The housing crisis is blighting the lives of a generation, and robbing them of the dream of home ownership. But as this analysis shows, this is not just the consequence of the financial crisis - it is part of a pattern stretching back half a century in which we have steadily built fewer and fewer new homes.  The Government has rightly promised to focus on this issue, and there are encouraging signs that housebuilding is picking up. “But ministers need to take bold action in  to ensure that the s become the decade in which we break this hugely damaging cycle.” The think-tank was set-up by Mrs Thatcher and Keith Joseph in .

The unelected leader - accused of presiding over mass human rights abuses including executions and work camps - said he was ready to have his second meeting with the US President at any time after they met in . But he also warned North Korea would have to follow a new paththe US breaks its promises to the shadowy state. Trump and Kim signed a deal in June to work towards denuclearising the Korean peninsula - in exchange for working towards prosperity. But both sides had to compromise massively. The US bid for veriable and irreversible denuclearisation did not appear in the document. And there was no commitment to North Koreas wish to end crippling economic sanctions.  Kim Jong Un today reaffirmed his resolve to completely denuclearise the Korean Peninsula. But he warned he may have to take an alternative paththe United States continued to force Pyongyang into unilateral action. North Korea would have no option but to explore a new path in order to protect our sovereigntythe United States miscalculates our peoples patience, forces something upon us and pursues sanctions and pressure without keeping a promise it made in front of the world, Kim said in his nationally televised address. The comments are likely to fuel growing scepticism over whether Pyongyang intends to give up the nuclear weapons programme that it has long considered essential to its security. Kim and Trump vowed to work towards denuclearisation and build a lasting and stable peace regime at their landmark summit in Singapore in June. But little progress has been made since and satellite images have indicated continued activity at North Koreas nuclear and missile facilities.  Pyongyang has demanded Washington lt sanctions and declare an official end to the - Korean War in response to its initial, unilateral steps toward denuclearisation, including dismantling its only known nuclear testing site and a key missile engine facility. U.S. officials say those steps can be easily reversed and have not been veried, and Washington has slapped additional economic sanctions on the impoverished country. Washington halted some large-scale military exercises with Seoul, although smaller drills continued. Kim called for South Korea to completely stop joint military drills with the United States involving strategic assets, while multilateral negotiations should be pursued to build a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula. Now that North and South Korea decided to take the path of peace and prosperity, we insist that joint military exercises with outside forces should no longer be allowed and deployment of war equipment such as outside strategic assets should be completely stopped, Kim said. Analysts said Kims message sent clear signals that North Korea is willing to stay in talks with Washington and Seoul this year - but on its own terms. North Korea seems determined in  to receive some sort of sanctions relief ... The challenge, however, is will Team Trump be willing to back away from its position of zero sanctions relief  said Harry J. Kazianis at the Washington-based Centre for the National Interest. Kims remarks seem to suggest his patience with America is wearing thin.

Sadiq Khan, who wants a second referendum instead of crashing out of the EU in , said the Tories had made a mess of Brexit as he staged the show just metres from the Houses of Parliament. The phrase London is open was spoken in Spanish, Polish, French, Romanian, German and Italian as the pound.m taxpayer-funded fireworks kicked off in the capital, which voted % to remain in . And the London Eye was lit up to resemble an EU flag as the song There For You, by drum and bass artist Culture Shock, rang out. Furious Brexiteers accused him of politicising a public-funded event - but Mr Khan today defended the spectacular fireworks, saying they showed that whatever the outcome of Brexit London is open.  Some , ticket-holders lined the banks of the Thames to watch , projectiles made up of eight tonnes of fireworks fire into the sky from three barges and the London Eye. We Are Your Friends, Stay and Dont Leave Me Alone were among songs chosen for the -minute soundtrack, which featured artists from Ireland, France, Sweden and where. Mr Khan said he hoped this years event would demonstrate Londons relationship with Europe, and send a message of support to more than one million European citizens for whom the capital is home.  And he claimed the display would show Europe that the capital will remain open-minded and outward looking post-Brexit. The display was allocated pound.million from the Greater London Authoritys budget.  A further pound, was expected to be raised in sales of pound-a-head tickets and concessions. Officials estimated ticket holders would bring a pound.million economic benefit to London. It came as Theresa May used her New Year message to launch a desperate plea for MPs to back her Brexit deal.  Commons leader Andrea Leadsom today accepted many will call for a second EU referendumthe deal fails in a vote from January . But said she will fight tooth and nail against a so-called Peoples Vote. The people spoke in , and Parliament must deliver, she wrote in the Daily Mail.  The challenge by a London mayor to a Tory PM echoes the s, when the Greater London Councils Ken Livingstone opposed Margaret Thatchers policies across the river from the Houses of Parliament. It also recalls s State Opening of Parliament in which the Queen wore a hat many interpreted as a subtle nod to the EU flag.  Speaking just before the display, Mr Khan said: One of the things which upset many, many Londoners and many people across our country and in Europe is the tone and language used by politicians in Westminster, giving the impression were insular, inward looking, not welcoming to Europeans. I think the Governments made a mess of negotiations with the European Union.  Bearing in mind Parliament cant resolve the issue of how we will leave the European Union, we should allow the public to take back control with the option of staying in European Union, or accepting the deal made by the government. The pro-EU symbolism enraged Brexiteers, who complained the mayor was politicising an event funded by taxpayers. Trump supporter Pat Condell complained this shallow little man can’t get anything right while Tory Andrew Bridgen said the mayor was politicising an international public event in a betrayal of democracy. But not everyone was hung up on the politics. Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris tweeted: Amazing Fireworks London! Thank you! Have an awesome  everyone!

MPs are set to consider a law to make access to treatment fairer. Emma Edey, , denied IVF, said: “I am praying it goes through quickly.” Campaigners have branded it a disgrace that the so-called cruel postcode shylottery denies would-be parents the chance to have a child – unless they can afford private IVF. Currently only three local health authorities in England offer childless couples the recommended three free cycles of IVF, while many provide only one or none at all. But there is hope, as Labour MP Steve McCabe is pushing through legislation to bring the injustice to an end. Mr McCabe believes his private member’s bill, set for its second reading on January , could be passed into law by this time next year. He said: “Infertility is a medical shycondition and it is time we started treating it like one. It is simply unfair that access to IVF is down to where you live and not your medical need.” The Birmingham Selly Oak MP’s bill aims to get fairer access to treatment for any childless couple and would set a minimum number of IVF cycles.   He said he has cross-party support and added: “I will be doing everything in my power to make sure the postcode lottery for IVF is brought to an end.” Government is under pressure to act after the Fertility Network charity persuaded , people to sign an online petition in just  weeks. Chief executive Aileen Feeney said: “Childlessness affects one in six couples. That’s someone in every street. If you can’t get free treatment on the NHS and currently that depends completely on where you live, then only those wealthy enough to pay for IVF privately can hope to have a child.

She will deliver the petition to PM Theresa May.   Health watchdog the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recommends any woman under  should be given three full cycles of IVF, or one full cycle for those aged  to . Women who have three cycles increase their chances of having a baby to better than %. But just three of  clinical commissioning groups offer the three cycles – all in Greater Manchester. Seven offer none. Some break NICE guidelines by setting their own access rules – including reducing the age limit. Yet in Scotland any woman under  can have three full IVF cycles. In Wales women are entitled to two and in Northern Ireland those under  get one partial cycle of IVF. Those denied free IVF face having to find pound, a time for each round of treatment. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: “It’s wrong there is so little support and , backing this campaign shows the strength of feeling behind the call for change. Liberal Democrats are listening and ministers in Whitehall must listen too.” Its completely unfair Two couples from the same town demonstrate the appalling injustice of the IVF postcode lottery. Emma and Lee Edey, , married in  and were about to start IVF in  when their local CCG decided to pull the funding. Emma, , appealed against the decision, and was granted treatment only for it to be withdrawn. The Edeys await the verdict of the North East Essex CCG before Jan  to seetheir first cycle of IVF will be granted. Rachel and Tom Hinsbey also live in Colchester, Essex, but began their IVF treatment six years ago when they lived in Chelmsford - under Mid Essex CCG. They were granted the funding for a first round of treatment which saw the birth of their daughter Amalie on March , . They have since moved to Colchester and elected to use embryos frozen at the time of the first cycle of treatment to try again for another child.   The NHS funding for IVF had been withdrawn, so they paid privately at the Bourn clinic in Colchester - at a greatly reduced cost of pound. Twins Margot and Teddy were born three months ago, to make their family complete. Meanwhile a desperate Emma, who has a bowel condition but is ready for IVF, said: “We applied for exceptional circumstances, that was granted last May. “Then my hormonal levels were too high so I am back to the CCG  to seeI can go ahead with IVF. It is all to do with the egg quality. If I could afford to pay privately, I could have it tomorrow, but we do not have that kind of money.” Costs y, but could be up to pound,. North east Essex is one of the areas in England where all NHS IVF treatment has been removed or suspended. Emma described it as ‘completely unfair’ to offer IVF in one area, but not in another. “It is so frustrating to keep me waiting. “The last three years has been hell,” she added. “I am praying the law goes through Parliament quickly. None of us is any younger. I could have a three-year-old child now. Instead I am full of anger.” Rachel and engineer Tom Hinsbey, , tried for  months after their marriage to start a family before discovering Tom did not have a tube which carries sperm. They were then referred for NHS-funded IVF treatment. Rachel, , a former medical writer who now makes baby clothes, said: “The IVF funding was withdrawn six months after Amalie was born.   “We started again this time last year and we have just had twins but paid privately for the treatment ourselves. “Amalie was born in , where they inject the sperm directly into the egg which increases the chance of success. “Margot and Teddy were born three months ago using the embryos left over from Amalie’s treatment, it was cheaper for us because we stored them. “It came to about pound including treatment and drugs but that is way cheaper than it would have been otherwise. “The system is just crazy now. it is completely unfair, funding went from three frozen plus three fresh cycles in Essex to nothing. “Even London is better, Essex is now the worst place for any kind of fertility treatment. “IVF is seen as non essential and is the first thing to get axed. “But it has massive consequences for your health, physically and mentally, when you struggle to conceive. You feel as a woman that you are unable to do what you should be able to do. “Getting the specic reason something was wrong was so important - we at least knew what to do.

Forecasters are warning of a blast of Arctic air sweeping across the UK - bringing an end to the mild December weather much of the country enjoyed over Christmas. Last year, predictions for a deep freeze at the start of the year rang very true - as the so-called Beast from the East brought the country to a halt with thick snow covering much of the UK. Now experts are keeping an eye on the drop in temperatures as we move through January, monitoring whether the UK could be hit by another big chill. As well as a drop in temperatures, the Met Office are warning of patches of freezing fog across the country and a covering of frost for most parts this evening and tomorrow morning.  Met Office forecasters are warning to be prepared as we move through January with conditions predicted to get really cold, really quickly. Speaking about the chances of a second Beast from the East, Met Office spokesman Simon Partridge said a similar three-month forecast at the start of last year was even harsher than expected. He said: Last year there was widespread snow across many parts of the UK and temperatures were well below Theres a higher chance of seeing colder spells, and given that, as a result, theres a slightly higher chance of snow across the UK.  Its far too early to say in any detail, it might be that parts of Scotland which usually get snow will get more, or you might see snow sp widely., reports The Sun . Simon added that drivers heading back to work tomorrow morning should be prepared to scrape their car of frost. Met Office forecasters have warned that Britain is in the middle of a phenomenon called Sudden Stratospheric Warming .  SSW refers to a swt jump in temperatures in the stratosphere and is often linked to the onset of cold weather in winter. Jeff Knight, Met Office manager of modelling climate iability said: There is a very high likelihood of a ‘Sudden Stratospheric Warming’ around the end of the year, increasing the chances of colder-than-average weather in January and the rest of winter. We will keep looking at forecasts to know exactly when any potential cold, snowy spells will occur.

Dean Lovell-Payne, , who was incapacitated by a fall this summer, took a massive overdose in September  after having to endure almost three months without receiving any benefits at all. Now Dean, his partner Paula and their three children Andrew, , Lou, , and Phoebe, , have been forced to move into a house in woods on the outskirts of Bournemouth which is only accessible by a dirt track, meaning wheelchair-bound Dean is effectively housebound. Despite pleading with the Universal Credit helpline, after the -week payment delay Dean said he felt he had no option but to take his own le during the call as he thought his le insurance would pay out more quickly. He received his benefits the same day after police are believed to have alerted the DWP to the incident and a spokesman for the DWP said they ‘sympathised with the distress he felt’. Do you have a Universal Credit story  Get in touch webnews@trinitymirror   The former ambulance worker, from Poole, Dorset, said: “Each and every day is horrendous. “I realised it was utterly hopeless and that my le insurance would be more likely to pay out in time to help my family than Universal Credit was. “I thought it was my only option to stop them suffering. “I took an overdose. “I didn’t even hang-up the phone. I told the soulless b*****d exactly what I was doing. “It seemed like the only way my family would be safe and no longer suffering, the only end to the hardship and insecurity. “The next thing I knew the police and ambulance arrived. “I survived the overdose because I had tolerance to the painkillers and sleeping tablets I had taken, by luck more than judgement. “But I am not the same person. I’m anxious, fearful and distrusting of anyone in the benefits system. “Although I survived, I don’t see much of a future for myself.”   Dean has been on benefits since  after he developed sepsis and global nerve and joint pain following an operation. Despite his health improving and being able to work part-time with the ambulance service, he suffered a major fall and subsequent infection in June which prevented him from walking. Forced to move to a cheaper home, Dean applied for Universal Credit the same month. But he said their new house, which is a converted motel in isolated woodland outside Bournemouth near Ringwood, Dorset, is totally inadequate for he and his family to live in. Dean said: “The access to the house is terrible. “It’s just gravel tracks and sometimes I feel like a prisoner in here. The house is very, very cold in the winter too. “Half the month we don’t have any heating because we can’t afford to heat the house.” But after going through the necessary checks, Dean was told that he would have to wait five weeks for the payment to be processed. He claims the delay of  weeks in total meant he and Paula came close to being forced to put their children into care and meant that they extinguished any meagre savings the couple had.   He said: “Five weeks came and went. We waited and waited and were reaching crunch time. “Our money had long since run out and the end of the school holidays meant the knock-on effects of no universal credit were going to bite. “Without confirmed Universal Credit we could not get our kids to school, could not sort out their free school meals or feed them at home. “We also had letters from council tax demanding money. “We couldn’t get my prescriptions either all of our standing orders were set to bounce within days. “The only safety net I had left for my family was my le insurance.” Dean said that although he survived his overdose, his le has not improved. He added: “I struggle out of bed in the morning to take my daughter to school and then get back into bed. “I’ve worked all my le but am made to feel like I’m worthless just because I’m too sick to work. “I feel helpless. There doesn’t seem to be anywhere to turn.”   Paula, who is Dean’s full-time carer and has to carry him to the car daily so he can drive his daughter to school, said: “I dont know from one day to the nextwe can get my daughter to school or not. “Were supposed to provide for our family but we cant. I watch Dean struggle day to day and its terrible. “I feel like a failure as a mother because we cant do the things for our kids that were supposed to. A DWP spokesperson said: “We sympathise with the distress Mr Lovell-Payne felt. “Jobcentre staff handled his claim sensitively and in line with their duty of care. “A Universal Credit payment was made as soon as Mr Lovell-Payne’s claim had been properly veried.”   THE FAMILYS INCOMINGS: pound Universal Credit pound PIP pound Carer AllowanceTOTAL  pound THE FAMILYS OUTGOINGS: pound rent pound direct debitspound electricity pound coal pound gas pound Iceland shop pound for daughters’ travel TOTAL  pound DISCREPANCY  -pound, Dean spends on his credit card monthly to make up the dference and cover petrol and any other unexpected expenses.

Mike Findley MBE, , was diagnosed with the muscle-wasting condition in  and after learning he could live for only four years, worried he would never be able to fulfill the fatherly tradition for his daughter, Rachel. But with the help of his brother-in-law Peter Atkinson, Mike, from Marske in Teesside, led his dental nurse daughter to marry her fianceacute Ash Stothers -  years after first being diagnosed. Mike described the day as one of the best in his le and said he had to hold back the tears while watching Rachel and Ash during their first dance, reports Teesside Live. The former Redcar and Cleveland mayor said: When I was first diagnosed with MND and I got the two year scenario, one of the first things I thought about was I might not be able to take Rachel down the aisle.   To have actually done it - well, along with my own wedding- it was the best day of my le. “I felt good in myself and I had a nice suit, shirt and tie on for the first time in eight years! “And I kept the emotions in check by and large, although I nearly lost it when they had the first dance. “Judith and I are so proud of Rachel. She has certainly added plenty of laughter in our lives, while Ash has also been a great help to me, always making sure that I’m OK and when we have decent weather, he gets me out in my wheelchair so I can enjoy time with friends in the Marske community.”   Mike also gave an emotional speech at the wedding, describing how Rachel gave her parents plenty of laughter throughout the years and recalling her happy childhood memories. He added: “I’ve always tried to stay positive. You get diagnosed with something like MND and you try and live with it, not die from it. “When you have a terminal illness, you never know how it’s going to pan out. But I’ve got a good le, friends, family - and now I’ve seen my daughter married. “It was wonderful and I’m just so pleased I could be there. It was a perfect day.

Norah Gibson, , never knew her birth mother because she was given up for adoption as a newborn back in . She spent  years trying to track down her biological mother. She grew up in a loving home and did not want to upset her adoptive parents by trying to trace her other family.But when her adoptive father John Gibson died in , she began her search in earnest. Grandmother-of-five Norah was finally able to get in touch with her birth mother, Rita Campbell, now aged , after a TV production company helped with her research. Two years ago, Rita travelled all the way from Canada to Scotland to meet her illegitimate daughter and they were reunited at Glasgow Airport. Norah, from Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire said: My mother was unmarried when she had me, and her parents took control.She never had a say in the matter.Care worker Norah was inspired to seek out her birth mother after being told by a guest at her own wedding Your mother would be very proud of you. The glamorous bride was aged  when she wed ex-husband Kenneth McMaster and was shocked when her ancestry was mentioned.But with the demands of raising four children, Andrew, Gregor, Ross and Lesley, and the tragic loss of her first child, Kenneth, her intentions of tracking down the woman who gave birth to her fell by the wayside.And Norah was afraid of upsetting her adoptive parents John and his second we, Peggy, who he married after the death of his first we, also named Norah.She described the couple as exceptional and loving.After their deaths, she trawled through records in Edinburgh and discovered that when she was born, the name given to her was Anne.Her mothers name was listed as Margaret Campbell, who lived at  Duntocher Road, Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire.Determined Norah pulled up the addresses of people named Margaret Campbell who still lived in the neighbourhood, but drew only blanks.She knocked on doors in the area but to no avail.Unbeknown to her, Margaret Campbell was known as Rita - and was living on the other side of the world, in Canada. They were reunited with the help of television producers and began to exchange letters - eventually speaking for the first time on Mothers Day.Norah said: We look alike, we think alike - it is so similar, its uncanny.My mum kept her secret all her le, there was only one of her brothers who knew.Their initial letters were short and pragmatic, addressing medical history. I think she was in shock and couldnt quite believe it, she added. It was the most surreal feeling.Norah learnt that she had a half-brother, Ian Fair, and got in touch with him too.And in November , Rita and Ian flew to Scotland to be reunited with their long-lost relative.As she waited at Glasgow Airport, Norah began to fear they had had a change of heart.But when tiny Rita, who stands at only ftins tall, walked through the arrivals hall she flung her arms around her daughter and told her here I am. For the first time in  years, mother and daughter were able to embrace - as when the baby was born, she had been taken away from Rita immediately.Norah said: Her hands were tied, she didnt have any part in the decision.She literally saw me being taken out of the room.Poignantly, they visited the building where Norah had been born in Dumbarton - dubbed by her mother as the scene of the crime.Over a two-week period, elderly Rita showed Norah the sights of Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, where she had spent her youth.Norah said: Id been looking for more than  years and got nowhere. I never wanted to give up looking for her.I looked in records in Clydebank Town Hall and in Edinburgh, but all I had was her name and address, I didnt know she was using the name Rita.Shes just amazing, shes a lovely wee person.In October this year, Norah flew to Canada to meet her second family - and met the huge Campbell clan in their hometown, Campbellford, Ontario.She spent Thanksgiving with them and says she has a lot to be grateful for - including the love and affection shown to her by the family who raised her after she was adopted in .Norah added: Im eternally grateful - I told her  it wasnt for you, I wouldnt have my five grandchildren.She created all these lives by going through what she did.I had to say that to her."},{"url":null,"title":"embarrassing moment man goes new","story":"NewsEmbarrassing moment man goes in for New Years kiss and gets rejected - on TVA clip of a woman dodging a mans kiss live on TV has gone viral on social mediaShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video man-goes-new-years-eve-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIts tradition in lots of places around the world to kiss somebody when the clock strikes midnight on New Years Eve.Its greatyou have a partner or are dating someone - butyoure going to use it as an opportunity to get closer to a crush then you need to make sure you read the signs right.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward. The opening of the Lodge is one step in many that the board are currently working towards and we are looking forward to unveiling the other plans that we have been working on very soon.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this. One of the endearing things about the Europeans, and I say this as a Brexiteer, is their cafe culture. This type of activity would be forbidden in places like Jedburgh.ldquoWhen a family goes to the park for a picnic, and brings a bottle of wine, they are now caught in the battle between over-legislation and common sense.ldquoI would say letrsquos encourage cafe lestyle, and its economic potential for increasing footfall and destination desirability.Although councillor Hamiltonrsquos motion was defeated by  votes to seven, councillors decided not to submit their by-laws to the Scottish Government and instead opted for more research into the potential benefits and disadvantages and for further public consultation."},{"url":null,"title":"make-a-date-with-sinatra-and-crosby-this-christmas-in-selkirk","story":"THERES a chance to swing your way into Christmas this weekend in Selkirk with some of the best-known festive hits.Christmas Crooners is coming to Victoria Halls on Sunday as part of their UK tour, now in its tenth record-breaking year.The show features the renowned West-End Singers performing the famous Christmas hits of all the greats, including Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole.They will be showcasing over  of the best-loved festive tunes, such as lsquoDeck the Hallsrsquo, lsquoChestnuts Roastingrsquo and lsquoSanta Babyrsquo, bringing some old-school Christmas glamour to the Borders.Stephen Leatherland, producer and director of the show, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted to be bringing Christmas Crooners to Selkirk and the Border region.\"This fantastic show has brought joy to many people over the last ten years and more, and we look forward to bringing a parcel of Christmas Magic to Selkirk ndash the perfect start to the festive season for young and old alike.Staged in the warm style of the famous Andy Williams Christmas Shows, this production comes complete with Christmas trees, a rocking chair and fireplace.Christmas Crooners is a community-minded event that will bring people together in the local town hall over the Christmas period to celebrate all things festive, with top-quality musicians performing Christmas classics.Hamish Moir, events and programming officer for Live Borders, said: ldquoI canrsquot think of a better way to celebrate the festive season than by heading to the local town hall for an evening of recreating the biggest Christmas hits.\"The Christmas Crooners put on a top quality performance with the West-End singers and Jazz-All-Stars, and we canrsquot wait for them to come to Selkirk for a cosy evening of live music.ldquoWe have a great series of events running over Christmas and in  that would make great gts, and I recommend looking at our website to view the full programme.\"At Live Borders we want to help make communities healthier, happier and stronger, especially at Christmas time, so come and join us on December  for these feel-good hits.Christmas Crooners will be performing in Victoria Halls, Selkirk, on Sunday at :.Tickets, priced at pound., are still available from www.eventbrite or by calling  ."},{"url":null,"title":"council-accused-of-paying-over-the-odds-for-lowood-estate","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has been told ldquoit may come to regret its decision to buy what remains of the Lowood Estate after it was revealed that government valuers advised the authority it would be paying over the odds.The council has spent pound.m on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.Council officers believe that the site, as part of a wider Tweedbank development plan, will create  permanent jobs, and a similar number during the construction phase.The site has also been earmarked for a -home housing estate.At a full meeting of the council yesterday, December , its executive member for business and economic development, Mid-Berwickshire councillor Mark Rowley, told members: ldquoThis was a project set in motion by a previous council.ldquoIn , the previous council agreed to the purchase of Lowood in principle, and over the last few years, work has been developing on this.ldquoWhat makes this incredibly important, probably more important than it was in , is that with all the talk around budgets, the council can no longer just sit back and try to carry on carrying out services.ldquoWe need to take decisive and strategic action, and this is an incredibly bold, and good, large-scale development.ldquoItrsquos maximising benefits wersquore already seeing with the Borders Railway. It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-ministers-book-of-poetry-inspired-by-the-bible","story":"The Rev Jock Stein, along with we Margaret, was joint locum minister at Cockenzie Old Parish Church before stepping down in .Originally he started writing one poem for each of the  books in the Bible and then, encouraged by friends, expanded his poetic project further.He said: ldquoThey said to me it was daft just to approach it that way as it would be too complicated and folk might not understand it, so it was suggested I focus on people and their stories, which is why From Cosmos to Canaan is the first of many volumes.ldquoIn it I examine key issues and use poetry to give a new slant on it.

There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-brexit-has-exposed-the-differences-between-the-scots-and-the-english","story":"If the main point was this latter one, the author failed to take account of the nature of this UK Prime Minister, who is as non-consensual as any I can remember ndash and that includes Margaret Thatcher. Also, let us not forget the entrenched position of the British Establishment to avoid PR, devolution ndash and federalism ndash in the UK.If, however, the authorrsquos main point was that England isnrsquot so dferent to Scotland, I would suggest that the article very clearly outlined signicant dferences which contradicted this assertion.First, in marked contrast to England, the leadership of all political parties in Scotland were united against Brexit ndash surely, a huge dference to be noted. Indeed, one of the most excruciating sights of the last two years has been to see Labour and Conservative politicians changing direction like little flags in the wind, as their English leaders have switched their Brexit policies from soft to hard to no-deal and back again.Secondly, the rural metropolitan split in Englandrsquos Brexit vote was stark, whereas the vote in Scotland was unormly Remain ndash we all remember that map ndash whether considered in terms of rural metropolitan, or north south, or even island mainland, for that matter.In summary, I would suggest that the conduct of the Brexit campaign, the result, and the subsequent analysis of the social attitudes which led to the result absolutely do show that the Scots are dferent to the English, at least so far as attitudes to the EU are concerned.Of course, the inevitable question for future discussion is how best to finesse these dferences.

On most occasions that a Leave voter contributes an observation to the media on Brexit, it comprises these vague and unsubstantiated statements, often with some hints at ldquodays of the Empire.

This, after three years of everyone being told by David Cameron and everyone , including Theresa May, the Prime Minister for all her years in the job that it would be final. Not a single voice in any newspaper or anywhere  in the media, in all that time, has ever suggested that the democratic will of the people was only advisory, to be rejected by the House of Commonsit wished. These papers referred to have no credence, no validity, no force, for they have been over-ridden by the repeated statements of the referendum vote being sacrosanct by the current Prime Minister and her predecessor and accepted as such by everyone. Other papers have doubtless been omitted. That is how desperate the losers are to recover their position.Many have objected that the decision was wrong, but that it was the will of the people has been accepted for three years before the vote was ever held. These letters advancing the case of the referendum are the last-ditch defence of people who think they know better than the will of the people of the country. That arrogance has been demolished many times these last three years.We must leave and we must do so with honour. We must control our manner of leaving and not be bullied by the EU. They will come begging for a relationship after the orce. Then it will be a decent one. We will see to it.William Scott, Argyle Place, Rothesay.AS this dismal year draws to a close one has a sense of being led by ldquothe mad, the bad and the incompetent.Having experienced the vile, isive Scottish referendum, the bitterness unleashed by Brexit was expected.But itrsquos none the less depressing and the only hope is that itrsquos often darkest before the dawn.

For a start, the gorge is ft deep which means the only way to get at the ldquonon-native species ndash Japanese knotweed and rhododendron ponticum ndash is to abseil down. The abseilers then have to identy where the plants are and spray them with weed-killer. Even the trust admits itrsquos pretty extreme stuff, but this is the point wersquore at now. In fact, the people working to eradicate ldquonon-native species see operations such as the one at Corrieshalloch as a ldquowar or ldquobattle against an ldquoinvasion or ldquoswarm. Those are the words they use. The defenders of our apparently native plants talk like theyrsquore on a battlefield or in a B-movie. And no-one laughs.However, I think now is the time to start questioning the orthodoxy,only to save us from more hyperbole. The narrative of the National Trust, and other organisations ndash backed by the Scottish and UK Governments ndash is that ldquonon-native species cost millions of pounds and that they must be eradicated to protect the ldquonative ones, even though their argument defies common sense, the history of the planet and the evolution of plants and animals. A fir tree or a grey squirrel doesnrsquot know where the border between two countries is, and nor should they, because the ision between native and non-native, like borders, is entirely man-made.The rhododendron ponticum that the National Trust wants to eradicate from Corrieshalloch is a good example. The plant has had all kinds of UKIP-style rhetoric thrown at it over the yearsand itrsquos mainly because, according to its detractors, it spreads fast and prevents other plants from growing. James Fenton, an ecologist who has worked for the National Trust, has even suggested thatwe took no action to control the plant and came back in a thousand years, the landscape of Scotland would be just one dark rhododendron forest.But could I stick up for the rhododendron ponticum, based on what the plant actually does  Itrsquos true that it thrives in certain types of soil, but it is no more or less likely to spread than ivy or bracken. The dference, of course, between bracken and rhododendron ponticum is that one is considered native and the other non-native even though rhododendron ponticum was certainly in this part of the world before the last Ice Age and was then reintroduced to Britain from seeds  years ago. How long does a plant have to be here before it is considered native The idea that rhododendron ponticum would spread ad infinitum is also flawed ndash thatrsquos just not how nature works. For example, the Americans used to get hysterical about the purple loosestre plant, which was accused of the same crime as rhododendron ponticum ndash reducing ersity ndash but the long-term evidence was dferent: there was a first wave of the plant, then it declined, and the natural ersity reasserted itself. With the exception of very small islands, this is what new species in an area do: they increase ersity rather than reduce it.The search for a scientic definition of ldquonon-native does not help either because there isnrsquot one. In fact, the whole idea of native and non-native was pretty much invented by Victorian botanists like Hewitt Watson, although no one has ever really been able to agree what the words mean. Should we go back to some kind of year zero ndashbut then how far back would you go  Andyou go too far back, you reach a point where the world was one great continent anyway and every plant and animal could spread and roam freely.Some attempts to define native and non-native are based on whether there has been human intervention, which is the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach, but this is also far from consistent. There is a widely-held view, for example, that grey squirrelsare non-native and should be culled, but why arenrsquot we seeking to eradicate other species that have been introduced such as the common pheasant  And what about the collared dove  Why spend money on measures to control the grey squirreland nothing on the collared dove, which has only been around in the UK since the s but is presumably competing with ldquonative birds for food It is this kind of inconsistency that makes a mockery of the whole native non-native ision and the National Trust for Scotlandrsquos operation at Corrieshalloch Gorge. Letrsquos deal with facts instead. Such as this one: plants and animals are not harmful just because they were introduced by humans, nor are they necessarily good for bioersity because they werenrsquot.And this fact: there are much greater environmental threats than the spread of ldquonon-native species, such as plastic and other types of waste, intensive farming, and industrial pollution - all of which are linked to the most dangerous native of all: humans.And then therersquos this fact: our ecology is changing all the time, animals and plants come and go, they thrive, fade, spread, fall back and rise again, and therersquos no reason why a erse and healthy environment of the future canrsquot include so-called non-native species. In fact, do you think that in a thousand years the petty definitions that are driving us to the bottom of gorges with weedkiller will matter  Our ecology will have moved on. There may not even be a Scotland or any other border by which to define our species. And the best thing about that  The plants and the animals will just get on with it anyway. They wonrsquot even notice."},{"url":null,"title":"year-in-review-looking-back-at-a-bruising-2018","story":"It brought us Cuba without a Castro at the helm and Cambridge Analytica out of the shadows.In France the prevailing political colour was yellow, while across Yemen starvation remained an added predator in a war in which children were increasingly the victims.In all,  globally was a bruising year for the optimists and one that began and ends with a shutdown of the US government as Donald Trump the man who dominated the yearrsquos headlines continues to make them.As one New York Times headline put it earlier this month, for Mr Trump itrsquos ldquo a war every day, waged increasingly alone.That much was evident at yearrsquos end as US Defence Secretary James Mattis, the man many regarded as the ldquolast adult in the room of Mr Trumprsquos White House resigned over the Presidentrsquos abrupt decision to withdraw US troops from Syria and Afghanistan.As the New Year looms the US federal government is expected to remain partially closed in a protracted standoff over Mr Trumprsquos demand for money to build a border wall with Mexico.For many in Washington this parting shot of  and the standoff and political acrimony created is just another ominous portent of things to come in , a year in which the President will come under unprecedented pressure as legal investigations pile up around him.Looking back on  the US mid-term elections might just have marked the beginning of the end of Donald Trumprsquo presidency, but only time will tell.Overall Americans must have done a lot of soul searching last year as their country remained a fractured place and the scourge of another shooting took its toll on civilians in Parkland Florida.Elsewhere in the world it was no less turbulent as Moscow under Russian President Vladimir Putin increasingly made its stamp on the global stage. Who can forget that wink from the Russian leader to his US counterpart at the start of the Helsinki summit  Who was not flabbergasted that Mr Trump then went on to side with Russia against the FBI over claims of interference in the  presidential election Both men are not known for being well disposed towards a free and unfettered media and last year was one in which threats to press freedom reached a new high.The brutal killing of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi was a chilling reminder of what media watchdog Reporters Without Bordersdescribed in wider terms as hatred whipped up by ldquounscrupulous politicians.Mr Khashoggirsquos murder shocked the world and put the country, and its young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman under closer international scrutiny.If there is an upside to this terrible story itrsquos that perhaps at least it helped bring pressure on Riyadh over its prosecution of the Saudi led coalition war in Yemen.This month ldquomilestone peace talks began in Sweden and the hope is they will help bring about an end to a war that has resulted in  million people or half of Yemenrsquos population now needing aid to survive.But Yemen is not the only place in  that saw humanitarian agencies placed under enormous pressure. As I write Indonesia again reels from a deadly tsunami, an eerie reminder of the terrible Boxing Day disaster back in .In Democratic Republic of Congo too an Ebola epidemic that has taken grip is itself a devastating repeat of a similar outbreak in West Africa in .In the Middle East so often a crucible of suffering there was some good news as Iraqi voters flocked to the polls in  for the first time since driving out the Islamic Stategroup in  after the Iraq civil war.It was signicant election for the country as Iraqis were given the power to decide their future with the potential to sht the balance of power and mend isions between ethnic groups.That said, the jihadists of IS continued to pose a considerable threat in  with many analysts suggesting they were reconstituting their forces and establishing a network of cells to pursue a guerrilla insurgency both in Iraq and neighbouring Syria.Elsewhere around the world Islamist-inspired terror cast its shadow. In Europe, France once again bore the brunt, most recently when -year-old Cher Chekatt, armed with a gun and kne near Strasbourgrsquos famed Christmas market killed two and injured another  people.The terror attack came at what was already a turbulent moment for France as one of the yearrsquos most ldquovisible political phenomena, the gilets jaunes or yellow vest movement took to the streets in a challenge to French President Emmanuel Macron.Ugly as the scenes in Paris have been, in terms of international stories this past year, the gilets jaunes protests against what they see as financial exploitation by the Francersquos privileged metropolitan elite, captured the imagination of many around the world.It was a year also in which we witnessed a backlash against big tech. More people in  have access to the internet than safe drinking water.But as the worldrsquos digital population continues to grow there are fears not everyone is reaping the so-called ldquodigital idends of this transformation.The story of how researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan and his company used a personality quiz to harvest the Facebook data of up to  million people before sharing some of it with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, served as a stark reminder of the dangers that lurk in our digital online age. Perhaps refreshing then to recall that heroic story earlier in  in which a team of young football players and their coach survived for  days before being extracted by cave rescue ers inThailand.Tragic as the death of one courageous rescuer was, how unusual it was to follow a story with a largely happy ending.

His focus, however, would be on Transport, which he regarded as his primary job.ldquoHe had made it clear that he did not intend to do anything which could be done by the [Scottish] Executive.

Arguably, it was the first such year for a decade, given  was so dominated by the independence fight.It showed. The SNP lacked its usual dynamo.The absence of a campaign put the spotlight on to its record rather than its aspirations, and demonstrated why the First Minister and other politicians love a good contest.Making promises is so much easier than keeping them.After years in door-knocking mode, the SNP ranks got antsy. Where was the referendum they had been promised  Surely Ms Sturgeonrsquos talk of a ldquotriple lock mandate the previous year wasnrsquot just a piece of rhetorical thistledown Troubled by the listlessness at the top, the Yes movement took it on itself to organise.A series of marches organised by the All Under One Banner group brought tens of thousands on to the streets of cities around Scotland through the spring and summer.In the SNP deputy leadership race, Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny stood on an explicit  of a second referendum in .His rivals felt compelled to talk up the prospect of another vote too, although they were more circumspect about dates.Nor did the partyrsquos long-lost Growth Commission allay activist jitters when it finally appeared.Andrew Wilsonrsquos revised economic blueprint for independence was more curds and vinegar than milk and honey. The left of the party baulked at its hairshirt focus on deficit reduction and its plan to keep sterling.More tensions bubbled to the surface at the SNPrsquos October conference, with MP Angus Macneil telling his party not to ldquodither like the Jacobites at Derby when they gave up their march on London.Other MPs suggested independence might arrive via an unidentied ldquodemocratic event rather than a referendum, given Theresa May refused to grant the latter.It was hardly a schism, but such shows of frustration and doubt with the leadership are rare in the modern SNP.Citing the delays and muddleover Brexit, the First Minister backed away from her pledge to give a ldquoprecise timescale for Indyref in the autumn, kicking her announcement into the New Year - for now - and making a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit her priority, even though another EU referendum would not leave enough time for a new independence vote before .By December, even Alex Salmond was questioning his successorrsquos appetite for a second referendum, wondering on his RT TV showthe ldquoCaledonian leboat would ever be launched.The former first minister was a key part of the SNPrsquos grim year. In January, two female civil servants made sexual misconduct complaints against him relating to .It would be another seven months, after an investigation overseen by Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, that their existence would enter the public domain.When they did, the effect was explosive. Furious at the way the case had been handled, Mr Salmond launched a judicial review against the government he once led and quit the SNP after  years as a member,  as its leader, to spare it ldquointernal ision.It took him barely three days to crowdsource pound, to pay for the legal action.Ms Sturgeon publicly backed Ms Evans. Battle lines were drawn. Mr Salmond reportedly refers to his former protegee as Lady Macbeth and is gunning for one of her key aides.When the judicial review hearing starts at the Court of Session two weeks today, Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeonrsquos government will play for keeps. A polarising fight could see SNP members take sides. It is a moment the party should dread.The reorganisation of income tax into five bands, albeit under pressure from the Scottish Greens, was another bold change. Derek Mackayrsquos decision not to copy Tory tax cuts in England and Wales for the wealthy has continued the experiment, despite flak about a cross-border tax gap.But in education, Ms Sturgeonrsquos top priority, and in health, which consumes almost half the Scottish revenue budget, the Governmentrsquos record has been lamentable.There is no expectation that NHS waiting time or treatment targets will be hit any more. When the monthly stats come out, the only question is how badly they will be missed.Demonstrating how much tougher it is to run a delivery department than shuffle money, former finance secretary John Swinney has toiled in the education brief.In June, he was forced to halt his flagship school reform bill because of a lack of support. To give him cover for this woeful climbdown, Ms Sturgeon reshuffled her Cabinet the same day, getting shot of Shona Robison from health and Keith Brown from economy.But the excitement at the promotion of a new generation of ministers didnrsquot last long. In a blog written long before she became an MSP, Gillian Martin had written about ldquohairy knuckled, lipstick-wearing transgender laydees.Despite its existence being reported in , no one in government read it for the reshuffle. Ms Martin became the mayfly minister, in charge of higher education for a day, then gone. Ms Sturgeonrsquos judgment was put under the microscope and found wanting.Mr Swinney was also humiliated by MSPs voting against standardised testing for P pupils, and by some councils refusing to implement it.The first teachersrsquo strike in a generation is looming over pay.But as Ms Sturgeonrsquos deputy, he remains unsackable.At health, Jeane Freeman has come clean about problems she has inherited, writing off pound million of emergency loans to health boards they canrsquot repay and admitting ldquolegally binding waiting time guarantees will be missed until .However Audit Scotland continues to warn of cash problems in health as well as across local government, where reserves are being run down to an alarming degree.Itrsquos been no picnic on the railways either, with ScotRailrsquos performance hitting record lows, and Transport Secretary Michael Matheson impotently huffing and puffing at the franchise holder Abellio.Worse, he waived sanctions for their lousy service after accepting much of the blame lay with Network Rail, which is owned by the UK Government. The SNPrsquos plan to merge British Transport Police and Police Scotland north of the Border was aborted.As with much of Brexit, the fights of a few months ago, so intense at the time, seem dim and distant. In the spring, Ms Sturgeon and Michael Russell led a cross-party Continuity Bill through Holyrood to avoid a lsquopower grabrsquo of devolved competencies.But the Supreme Court effectively gutted it after a challenge by the UK government delayed its Royal Assent and allowed Westminsterrsquos EU Withdrawal Act to supersede it.Mr Russell also threatened to gum up the constitutional works by withholding consent for any Brexit-related Bill that came to Holyrood under the Sewel convention, then quietly backed down in the face of a Bill that was needed to give Scots health cover after Brexit.Despite all that, Ms Sturgeon remains a top-flight politician.In the last year, she has successfully portrayed Scotland as a beacon of stability amid the roiling chaos of Brexit. Her attacks on Jeremy Corbyn for vacillating over the biggest political issue in a generation have struck home. Her early emphasis on customs and single market continuity has been adopted by other parties.But turning the calendar on  will not put her problems behind her. The SNPrsquos basic plan in government ndash keep things simmering along inoffensively until therersquos a Yes vote ndash looks uninspiring and timid, even in its own ranks.Brexit also seems to have given voters their fill of constitutional upheaval. There is little appetite for a second independence referendum.The weary ldquowill she, wonrsquot she dance about the timing of another vote is likely to reach its anti-climax soon.If there is no general election or Peoplersquos Vote in , the focus on Scotlandrsquos public services will intensy, and it will not be to the SNPrsquos advantage. Mr Salmondrsquos day in court is nigh. The police continue their investigations.Any party in power as long as the SNP is self-evidently a ldquomature government.

Each writer has then paired up with a composer and visual artist or film-maker, with the results of each collaboration projected in monumental fashion on the walls of one of half a dozen of the capitalrsquos most iconic buildings.With venues stretching from the south side of Edinburgh to Leith, and with one city centre stop requiring a walk up Calton Hill, there is considerable legwork required to complete the circuit. It shouldnrsquot be considered a race, however, and audiences are free to move between venues at their leisure, visiting each site on dferent evenings between dusk and pm to suit their schedules as desired.Unlike last yearrsquos inaugural event, when novelist Val McDermid charted the le and work of neglected nineteenth century novelist Susan Ferrier through ious Edinburgh streets, there is no continuous narrative in this yearrsquos Message from the Skies. This makes each work akin to a set of site-specic installations and environmental interventions that transform their immediate landscape.Such reimagining of the city capitalises on the recent epic-scale opening events commissioned by Edinburgh International Festival, and featuring overwhelming sound and light shows created by  Productions and projected onto the Usher Hall and Edinburgh Castle. Unlike those spectacles, words are the primary focus of this yearrsquos Message from the Skies, which looks set to be a more reflectivenot always meditative affair.ldquoItrsquos very dferent this year, explains Glass. ldquoWersquove got six very dferent writers, and each one has taken a completely dferent approach to the brief they were given, which was simply to write a love letter to Europe. I suppose thatrsquos made for more free-expression than last year, which seems only fitting just now given everything thatrsquos going on, and itrsquos been really gratying as dferent drafts have come in, and incredibly emotional as well. It really feels like this is what art should be doing right now.The writers include historian William Dalrymple, who takes an impassioned look at Scotlandrsquos relationship with mainland Europe against the backdrop of the Tron Kirk, brought to le by bespoke projection company Double Take Productions, and featuring a score from composer RJ McConnell.Bulgarian born and Highland-based non-fiction writer Kapka Kassabova will explore the origins of Europe alongside the even more dramatic Scottish Monument on Calton Hill. This will be accompanied by a score by Pippa Murphy, which is inspired by Greek, Mesopotamian and Gaelic female chanting, while images from Susannah Murphy and Cristina Spiteri of Bright Side Studios dissolve into the ether as time moves on.Leith Library is the setting for poet William Letfordrsquos touching reminiscences, with artist James Houston taking a typographical approach to illustrating the story. At Custom House, also in Leith, journalist Chitra Ramaswamyrsquos letter looks back to her childhood, holidays in Spain and le in Scotland with roots as a second-generation immigrant. Daniel Warrenrsquos accompanying film will mix archive footage and animation, and will feature a song by Emma Pollock.Up at the Cowgate, at the Bongo Club, playwright Stef Smith joins forces with composer MJ McCarthy and artist Eleanor Meredith for a moving tale of separation and broken hearts set to McCarthyrsquos ambient score and Meredithrsquos vivid watercolours. Over at the Tech Cube in Summerhall, fiction writer Louise Welsh pares things back to explore the international language of words themselves, with designer Emlyn Firth using typography to illustrate it.With a total of sixteen artists working on Message from the Skies, this multi-media fusion of form and content is itself an illustration of what might happenshared experience is used for the power of good.ldquoThe collaborations were the fun bit of it, says Glass. ldquoI spoke to each of the writers very early on, and started to try and get a feel for how they were thinking, and how they formally might approach things. Listening to that, you start to see and hear things that makes you think about what the end result might be, and to keep the authenticity of that you start to think about people from other artistic disciplines who might sit well within what each writer is doing, and you try and pair them up. People just wouldnrsquot have come into each otherrsquos spheres without this project, and you start to see and hear the words dferently.Glass doesnrsquot mention Brexit by name, but the shadow of the UKrsquos forthcoming departure from Europe looms large over Message from the Skies. Run in partnership between current Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay producers Underbelly, Edinburgh City of Literature and Edinburgh International Book Festival, and enabled by the Scottish Governmentrsquos Festivals Expo fund, the initiative also points up some of the problems which have already arisen regarding bringing artists from abroad to these shores.While the writers werenrsquot asked which way they voted regarding Brexit before they were commissioned, that should become clear from the work itself. There is little in the way of tub-thumping on display, however, with each piece humanised by the deeply personal tone of them all.ldquoDidactic is word thatrsquos been used a lot when wersquove talked about some of the big polarisations that exist when wersquore talking about Europe just now, says Glass. ldquoA lot of those conversations have been about the role of writers and artists in managing those conversations, and whatrsquos happened as wersquove gone along is that itrsquos become okay to make statements that are hard. There may be people who disagree with whatrsquos in a letter, but I think itrsquos still important to be able to make the space to have that conversation.The words written by the six writers taking part in Message from the Skies will live on regardless of what happens next, and can be published in book formdesired. The assorted artworks that bring those words to le have also been created with the same sense of love and care, and given the scale of the event, it is hoped that they too might have another le, crossing borders with their own unique sonic and visual languages as they go.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be brilliantthis could go across the world and other people could see it  Glass muses. ldquoWouldnrsquot it be wonderfulit could travel Message from the Skies, ious venues, Edinburgh, today-January , dusk-pm.www.edinburghshogmanay"},{"url":null,"title":"aldi donates over 15k meals to charities","story":"Supermarket chain Aldi spread some festive cheer in the north east on Christmas Eve by donating , meals to ten charities.Aldi paired ten stores with local charities and food banks to make the most of quality unsold fresh food after stores closed on December .Around , meals were donated across the country, including , from Aldi’s stores in Scotland.

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Year honours list in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.ldquoWe had been in No.  Group Bomber Command, says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. ldquoThe whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. ldquoWe had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogetherhellip It required a lot of dferent techniques.ldquoAnd it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore yoursquod got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.ldquoThere developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.ldquoOn one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnrsquot just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.ldquoObviously we knew something was happening, Don says, ldquobecause we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werenrsquot aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. ldquoBefore that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: ldquoOne thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Donrsquos chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as ldquoPiccadilly Circus ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.ldquoWe were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place, he explains. ldquoIt was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. ldquoThey all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. ldquoHe released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one, says Don.ldquoThere was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnrsquot a great deal of resistance.It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crewmates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: ldquoThe Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.ldquoYou couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnrsquot want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  ldquoWell, everybodyrsquos scared ndash I donrsquot care what anyone says, he replies. ldquoIf yoursquore not scared you donrsquot perform, but itrsquos discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .ldquoThis is rude, I know, but itrsquos what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Itrsquos a matter of accepting whatrsquos going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job yoursquore supposed to do.ldquoItrsquos not a question of bravery. Irsquom very suspicious when people say, lsquoOh, yoursquore a brave man,rsquo or lsquoYouve got a lot of courage.rsquo You react to circumstances. Itrsquos a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.ldquoAnd I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when yoursquove got a unorm on and yoursquore acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.ldquoSo Irsquom very suspicious about lsquobraveryrsquo. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I donrsquot think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I donrsquot know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.DON can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.ldquoI fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhamrsquos Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating, Don says. ldquoHe had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a manrsquos wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.ldquoBut the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thatrsquos what I did.He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash ldquoI went to Arnhem five times during that debacle, says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until rsquo.He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crewmates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.ldquoAlthough our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand, says Don. ldquoIn  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnrsquot got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hersquod said, lsquoIrsquod love to see my old mate again.rsquo So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.ldquoNow you canrsquot explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Itrsquos what they call camaraderie. Irsquom still in touch with his family.As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash ldquotherersquos no doubt about that. But he adds: ldquoI regret to say I donrsquot think wersquove learned any lessons. I donrsquot think we should be doing what wersquore doing now [in Iraq].ldquoAs I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Itrsquos not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Itrsquos a sad reflection on society, I feel.ldquoWe ought to be very thankful that wersquore free, because thatrsquos what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnrsquot be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.ldquoIt was all for a cause. People may say, lsquoOh, thatrsquos patriotic nonsense.rsquo But it isnrsquot.This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OrsquoGroat Journal of June , .Tuesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118591.jpg","title":"Just the ticket for tackling debt","story":"Scottish Government ViewpointTHE Scottish Government has launched a People, Not Profit campaign to support the Scottish Credit Unions that play a vital role in helping people stay out of unmanageable debt.The campaign seeks to support the growth of the sector by raising awareness of credit unions and the services they offer to a wider and more erse audience.Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, launched the campaign.A new survey has revealed one in five Scots have not heard of a credit union.Currently, around , people across the country are part of a credit union some seven per cent of the population.The survey revealed also that only two-fthsof people questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union, and that one in four peoplewrongly believe they make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign will highlight credit unions are not-for-profit organisations providing loans and savings, and most people would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live.A new website has been launched to help people find out which credit union they could be a member of.Ms Campbell said: \"In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high-cost lenders.\"A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.\"Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union and I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.\"Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, who is a credit union member, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining what the organisations are.* For more information, visit www.creditunions.scotTuesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

This is a new permanent  scheme.Councillor Matthew Reiss, Thurso and Northwest Caithness, a former senior police officer with a particular interest in road safety, said: ldquoIf you have a lower speed limit, safety is improved ndash that is a fact.ldquoIf the local residents are happy with it then Irsquom very happy. With many parked cars on the streets there is always a chance of children walking out between them and not being seen. Slower cars will cut the chances of any potential accident.The civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, Wick and East Caithness, said research had shown a big reduction in collisions in built-up areas in towns and villages following the introduction of mph zones. They also improved the character of residential areas and the quality of le for residents, he added.Councillor Andrew Sinclair, Wick and East Caithness, admitted to being a bit sceptical when he first heard about the proposal. ldquoIt sounded like change for the sake of change. Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Tuesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118636.jpg","title":"New chief is told of local issues","story":"BUDGET cuts and decentralisation were the main topics raised by Caithness people when the new Highland Council chief executive, Donna Manson, visited Wick and Thurso.She met staff, councillors and members of the public as she listened to their concerns and issues.

The issue was highlighted in the Courier of November  and Highland Council made aware of the most recent spate of vandalism in which first-floor windows were broken.A former janitor had confronted boys throwing stones at the windows and had previously alerted police when he saw people walking about on the roof of the former technical department.Speaking about her efforts to make the building safe, Councillor Sinclair said: \"I first asked for this work to be done several months ago but officers in every department are very stretched both for time and money, so I am pleased that the work has finally been completed and thank the people involved, both council and contractor.\"However, she stressed that it was only a \"small step forward\" and that it should \"not take elected members months of asking to have this small amount of work done\".She said: \"The council as a whole needs to consider whether it has become so bureaucratic and centralised that it effectively disempowers its own members. I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings. However, more recently windows on the higher first floor were also damaged.

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Well done to Pat Munro for taking an interest in the company and especially as it is local. Good luck with your negotiations.Another added: ldquoWell done Brian Munro. A good deal done there.The award-winning Carbon Dynamic, based at the Cromarty Firth Industrial Park, announced earlier this month it was unable to continue trading due to ldquochallenging conditions and signicant cash-flow dficulties.As a result,  local jobs were made redundant with just two workers kept on.But on Wednesday joint administrators Blair Nimmo and Geoff Jacobs of KPMG said the business had been sold to Pat Munro, safeguarding the future of the firm.Carbon DynamicLimited, a new company, has been set up to facilitate the purchase.Mr Nimmo said: ldquoIt is extremely pleasing to secure the sale of Carbon Dynamic in such a short time-frame, and to buyers who can see the potential in the business and its skilled workforce. The sale has achieved a good outcome for many stakeholders and we hope it will benefit the local area.ldquoAs new owners, Pat Munro has an ambitious vision to build on Carbon Dynamicrsquos reputation for cutting-edge design and manufacture of eco-friendly modular buildings, re-employing a number of Carbon Dynamicrsquos former staff and contributing to the ersity of the economy in the Scottish Highlands.Brian Munro, managing director of Pat Munro, which is one of the largest privately owned contractors operating in the Highlands, said: ldquoWe collaborated [with Carbon Dynamic in previous successful projects and were very saddened to learn of the financial situation which threatened the future of  important local jobs. As such, we are delighted to add Carbon DynamicLtd to the Pat Munro Group and we are committed to continuing, and enhancing, their superb progress to date.Cromarty Firth SNP councillor Maxine Smith, said: ldquoI am very pleased a local firm with a conscience has bought out Carbon Dynamic. Pat Munro will take good care of it.

This New Year’s Day, I’d like everyone to consider a resolution that will offer incredible experiences, culture and history ... visiting more of Scotland.Whether it’s a drive, a day trip or weekend away – we all know that, with an umbrella and a waterproof, Scotland has incredible scenery, culture and heritage to offer. From the rising numbers of whisky distilleries opening their doors to the opening of Scotland’s first design museum, the VA Dundee, Scotland’s visitor attractions are growing in quantity and quality. And with the most recent statistics showing that record numbers of overseas tourists are coming to Scotland, our industry going from strength to strength.Over the last year, I have seen this success first hand through my visits to the likes of the recently restored Castle Varrich in Sutherland to the fantastic Scottish Dark Sky Observatory in Galloway, and to some of the incredible events that we have hosted like the Mountain Bike World Cup and, of course, the European Championships. Around , people experienced the incredible hospitality Glasgow and Scotland have to offer at last year’s European Championships. I was lucky enough to watch some of the excellent sporting and cultural events in the city and it was great to see Glasgow  create a unique partnership with Berlin Germany and support the development of strong relationships across Europe.The opening of the world-class VA Dundee was a wonderful moment for me in . With , people expected to visit it within its first year of opening, it’s a powerful symbol of Dundee’s new confidence and a major addition to our world-class collection of museums and visitor attractions.: Nicola Sturgeon: I’ll protect Scotland’s place in EuropeAnd I was delighted to see the Highlands and Islands as the only UK destination listed in the Lonely Planet’s Best in Travel  top  regions, which is a really positive accolade for the year ahead.I am excited that Scotland will once again play host to the very best international sporting talent at a number of major events this year. In March, more than  athletes from  nations will take to the tracks at the Emirates Arena for the  European Indoor Athletics.While at Gleneagles in September, we will host the Solheim Cup, the biggest and best team event in women’s golf and a highlight of the sporting calendar. I’m sure that the world-class competition on show as Europe’s finest take on their American counterparts will make for an incredible spectacle, inspiring our young people, particularly girls, and once again showcasing Scotland as the perfect stage for major events.The Solheim Cup ends a full summer of golf, including the Aberdeen Standard Investments Scottish Open and Ladies Scottish Open, and will be a key part of an incredible summer for Scottish women’s sport, with our national football team competing in the World Cup in France and our hosting of the  UEFA Women’s Under- Championship.Scotland’s growing screen sector is also opening up opportunities for tourism and exposing Scotland’s natural beauty and heritage to new audiences. We have already seen the benefits of the Outlander effect – with visitor numbers to locations featured in the series increasing signicantly. And we would expect this trend to continue with Netflix’s recently released Outlaw King, filmed across  dferent Scottish locations including Craigmillar Castle, Linlithgow Palace and Talisker on Skye, and the new Mary Queen of Scots film set to be released later this month, which was filmed in Glencoe and in Edinburgh.: Outlander effect pushes tourist numbers in Scotland to record highWhile increasing visitor numbers is of course welcome, it is important that we have the infrastructure in place to handle the demand of increasing visitors. Our £ million Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund has been designed to manage growth sustainably, so the services and facilities that visitors and local communities need are provided. I was delighted to announce the first round of funding for the scheme to help support the creation of additional parking at Glenfinnan, and make improvements to facilities at other iconic sights like the Old Man of Storr and Cairngorms National Park. Some local authorities have called on the Scottish Government to give them the powers to introduce a tourism tax to help them meet the pressures of increasing visitors to their area. The Scottish Government has no plans to introduce a tourism tax but we do recognise there is a need to properly consider the wide range of views on this issue. We are currently convening a national discussion to give everyone an opportunity to air their views and have invited contributions and participation from a wide range of groups with an interest in tourism, economic growth and public sector finance, to ensure an informed, evidence-led discussion on this complex issue.Scotland continues to be an outward-looking and inclusive nation. And a nation that people at home and abroad should want to visit. This is an important message, particularly at this time with the UK’s exit from the EU fast approaching. Clearly Brexit will have profound implications for Scotland as a whole, but I know there are deep concerns in the tourism industry.Europe currently accounts for seven out of Scotland’s ten key visitor markets – and around  per cent of our overseas visitors. And the industry’s workforce is reliant on EU citizens – with around  per cent of those working in the sector from the EU.I am acutely aware of industry concerns around recruitment and retention of EU staff, which will not have been eased by the restrictive policy approach put forward by the UK Government in their Immigration White Paper. The evidence is very clear that our tourism sector would be poorer without the vital skills and experience of EU citizens.In the meantime, we are continuing to strengthen our ties with our nations in Europe and around the world, by expanding our network of innovation and investment hubs. And last year we launched the Scotland is Now campaign, promoting Scotland under a single, unied, national brand and bringing together combined spending of up to £ million to promote our country globally. In these uncertain times and in the face of a number of challenges, it is fantastic to see the on-going success of tourism and the Scottish Government, working with our national tourism organisation VisitScotland, will do all it can to help the industry continue to grow sustainably.With unrivalled sights, memorable visitor experiences and incredible hidden history let us all make that resolution to experience more of the place we are proud to call home.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850326.1546341218!/image/image.jpg","title":"kezia dugdale corbyn sturgeon and may all need loony dook","story":"IN the freezing waters of the Firth of Forth, a group of hardened revellers will today take part in the celebrated Loony Dook at Queensferry.

There will also be local drop-in sessions for residents.It’s great news that a new school is finally on course to be delivered.However, I remain disappointed that council chiefs have been forced to press ahead with scaled-back proposals for Castlebrae.That’s becausethey wait to find outthe Scottish Government is willing to put up cash to deliver the new school the community deserves, they will have to hold on until  to learn their fate.That’s far too long for children to be taught in unfit classrooms.So the council is pressing ahead by itself, using its own money for what I am hopeful will be an excellently designed school, but one that falls short of what could be deliveredthe Government had helped out financially.Ministers are letting down the Craigmillar community, which has some of the highest levels of deprivation and attainment challenges in the country.This is utterly unacceptable, and it’s time for the SNP Government to take its devolved responsibilities seriously and use its tax powers to invest in education.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850523.1546279029!/image/image.jpg","title":"new year s resolutions for sturgeon may and co paris gourtsoyannis","story":"From settling Brexit to challenging Donald Trump, the coming year will be a pivotal one for politicians, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.In the first three months alone, this year carries huge signicance for the future of the UK – but beyond Westminster, political leaders across the Western world could also do with a bit of introspection by way of first-foot.Here are a few New Year’s resolutions that those facing big decisions in  might want to consider.Nicola Sturgeon: Deliver home truths about indyrefOn independence, her critics would say Nicola Sturgeon has been the First Minister who cried wolf. She called for a second referendum on Scotland’s future, then backed down in the face of popular uncertainty. But to use a dferent cliché, indyref was the dog that didn’t bark in .Sturgeon can’t be blamed for the UK Government’s failure to settle the outcome of Brexit in time for the SNP leader to offer clarity on a second Scottish independence referendum – but that won’t hold for long in . She will eventually have to show her hand.When that moment comes, it will offer her the opportunity to deliver some home truths to her own supporters: that there isn’t time or means to keep Scotland in the EUthe UK leaves, and that true shape of the relationship between Brussels and London may not be known until close to the next Scottish election in .The Government in Edinburgh insists it has a mandate for a new independence referendum from this Scottish Parliament. Butthe Sturgeon believes the public will back leaving the UK over the final Brexit deal, why wouldn’t she put that to the public in  and prove it Another hold-up might not be the message independence activists want to hear, but it may be the only way to convince the majority of Scots that the question needs to be asked again.The UK Government: Get back to delivering the milkIt’s been a busy two-and-a-half years for the Blitz spirit, invoked at every opportunity by Brexit campaigners. It should mean automatic disqualication from public debate to suggest that the privations of wartime Britain are something to aspire to for the future, rather than a lesson from the past.Nonetheless, helped along by a handful of recent blockbuster Hollywood depictions, Winston Churchill has been repeatedly dragged into debate on Brexit by both sides either in support of the myth that Britain has always ‘stood alone’ in Europe, or that European unity was a Churchillian idea. In our present situation, I personally find the most useful quote attributed to Churchill his reflection that: “Democracy means when there’s a knock at the door at am, it’s probably the milkman.”The comment is obviously referring to examples of brutal oppression by the undemocratic governments of his time, but it also reflects the truth that democracy, when it s, is in part the triumph of small freedoms and practicalities over the big, dangerous idea.Events have moved at such a pace that it’s been impossible to stop and ask where we are. But however you feel about Brexit, it’s clear that a government of a wealthy country forced to nationalise shipping capacity to guarantee supplies of food and medicine, not because of a natural disaster but a political event taking place in just three months’ time, isn’t a responsible government, but one that has already failed.It serves the interests of a narrow and extreme segment of opinion to raise the stakes and turn every issue facing the West into a test of national virility. It allows representative democracies to be hijacked by debates about honouring ‘national sovereignty’ and ‘the will of the people’, asthose weren’t deeply conflicted and debatable concepts.Churchill should be invoked not just to remind us of our finest hour, but of just how banal democracy is supposed to be, when it works well.EU leaders: Tackle anti-immigration agenda head-onEurope has challenges beyond Brexit to face in , and the continent will have to find its way without the certainty of Angela Merkel’s leadership.She offered the strongest, most consistent defence of European values in response to the wave of refugees from conflicts across the Middle East and Africa. Someone  will need to step into her shoes and ensure the anti-immigration narrative doesn’t metastasise into a yellow-vested popular movement that could disrupt upcoming national and EU Parliament elections.US Democrats: Remember who your enemy isIt seems crazy that, with the US Presidential election still almost two years away,  will be decisive in whittling down the field of candidates seeking to oust Donald Trump from the White House.The Democrats would do well to ensure that the process doesn’t turn into a bloodletting. The signs aren’t good, with backers of  left-wing challenger Bernie Sanders and  breakthrough candidate Beto O’Rourke tearing chunks out of each other on social media.Yes, the party needs to refresh its identity to try win back the voters that helped deliver Trump the presidency.But Democrats also need their whole coalition to back the candidate they eventually settle on – something they didn’t achieve in .So much of the political narrative across the West relies on the outcome of the  presidential election. Perhaps more than in any US vote in history, the eyes of the world will be on the Democratic Party. They need to get it right.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850728.1546338762!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish woman separated from mum at birth hugs her for first time","story":"A woman separated from her mum at birth has spoken of being able to hug her for the first time after the pair were reunited -  years later.Norah Gibson, , never knew her birth mother as she was given up for adoption as a newborn, in .But the question of who she was bothered her relentlessly, and she spent  years trying to track down her biological mother, with no luck.She grew up in a loving home and did not want to upset her adoptive parents by trying to trace her other family.But when her adoptive father John Gibson died in , she began her search in earnest.Grandmother-of-five Norah was finally able to get in touch with her birth mother, Rita Campbell, now aged , after a TV production company helped with her research.Two years ago, Rita travelled all the way from Canada to Scotland to meet her illegitimate daughter and they were reunited at Glasgow Airport.Norah, from Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire said: “My mother was unmarried when she had me, and her parents took control.“She never had a say in the matter.”Care worker Norah was inspired to seek out her birth mother after being told at a guest at her own wedding ‘Your mother would be very proud of you’.The glamorous bride was aged  when she wed ex-husband Kenneth McMaster and was shocked when her ancestry was mentioned.But with the demands of raising four children, Andrew, Gregor, Ross and Lesley, and the tragic loss of her first child, Kenneth, her intentions of tracking down the woman who gave birth to her fell by the wayside.And Norah was afraid of upsetting her adoptive parents John and his second we, Peggy, who he married after the death of his first we, also named Norah.She described the couple as “exceptional” and loving.After their deaths, she trawled through records in Edinburgh and discovered that when she was born, the name given to her was Anne.Her mother’s name was listed as Margaret Campbell, who lived at  Duntocher Road, Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire.Determined Norah pulled up the addresses of people named Margaret Campbell who still lived in the neighbourhood, but drew only blanks.She knocked on doors in the area but to no avail. -

as when the baby was born, she had been taken away from Rita immediately.Norah said: “Her hands were tied, she didn’t have any part in the decision.“She literally saw me being taken out of the room.”Poignantly, they visited the building where Norah had been born in Dumbarton - dubbed by her mother as ‘the scene of the crime’.Over a two-week period, elderly Rita showed Norah the sights of Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, where she had spent her youth.Norah said: “I’d been looking for more than  years and got nowhere.“I never wanted to give up looking for her. -

and met the huge Campbell clan in their hometown, Campbellford, Ontario.She spent Thanksgiving with them and says she has a lot to be grateful for - including the love and affection shown to her by the family who raised her after she was adopted in .Norah added: “I’m eternally grateful -

politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland. was a milestone in a changing Ireland. It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8745500.1545401332!/image/image.jpg","title":"galgorm resort and spa evacuated","story":"Galgorm Resort and Spa has ed to business as usual after an evacuation earlier this afternoon.The hotel was evactuated as a precaution following a small electrical fire, which had been dealt with by staff by the time the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service had arrived at the scene, a fire service spokesperson said.Galgorm Resort and Spa.Victoria Brown, marketing manager at Galgorm Resort and Spa, said: “As a precautionary measure we evactuated the resort this afternoon following an incident whereby smoke was seen coming from a ceiling .

She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

Take some time to yourself, some time to reflect, some time to remember and some time to recharge the batteries for the New Year ahead.“Andpossible take some time for others, I have really enjoyed meeting people during my term of office and sometimes a kind word or deed, or just a chat can lt someone’s day. So this Christmas time, maybe call on people who may be lonely or those in need of comfort.“I also know that for many families, like myself and my husband, Christmas can be a dficult time. “It stirs up lots of memories of good times and bad, of love, and of loss. For those people and families, I have no words of good advice, as I’m still just getting through, but I will say, be kind to yourself, be kind to others, and do what is right for you. “I wish you all a very Happy Christmas and a Peaceful and Prosperous New Year!”* Bins scheduled to be collected on on Boxing Day, Wednesday, December , will be collected on Saturday, December .

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Only tickets for practice days remain.On a winter planning visit to the course, Mike Woodcock, director of corporate communications at the RA, said the pace at which tickets went took them by surprise.“We were confident there would be huge excitement here but I think even we were staggered by just how much there was when the championship days sold out in two months,” he said.“It was phenomenal really and I think that speaks volumes about the enthusiasm, not only for golf but for sport here in Northern Ireland.“The Open is one of the world’s greatest sporting events, the world’s greatest golfers will be playing here, and I think it’s just fantastic. We’re seeing a real buzz.”Due to the anticipated large crowds, this year’s Open was the first ever all-ticketed event in the Major tournament’s history – , people are expected through the gates.After meeting club officials, tourism bosses, emergency services and other state agencies involved in putting on the tournament, Mr Woodcock said plans were well ahead of schedule.The RA has already predicted that the tournament will deliver an £ million boost to the local economy, through combined direct spend and the value of the media exposure of the destination., Head of Corporate

Portrush, on the th green of the course at Royal Portrush Golf Club “Most of all I think it will be the number of golf fans who will come here from around the world, who have seen images of the Open on television and want to come and play here where they have seen Roryplaying, where they have seen Tigerplaying, and I think that’s what the real benefit is and I think years on from now that will continue,” said Mr Woodcock.Aine Kearney, from Tourism NI, is co-ordinating efforts to deliver Northern Ireland’s first Open in seven decades.“This will be broadcast to  million homes across  countries around the world,” she said.“And whilst the focus of the attention will be on the golf, what they will also get to see is the absolutely amazing landscape as well as a lot of the stories of the experiences that the players are having, the media are having – you can’t buy that level of exposure.“That’s why hosting global major events has been such a critical part to our long-term growth strategy and we believe it’s firmly one of the reasons why we are within touching point of becoming a £ billion industry.“It’s all about getting those positive messages out – to change the narrative about Northern Ireland and show the people of the world what an exciting, vibrant and beautul place this is to come and visit.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Open is ing to Northern Ireland for the first time in almost  years Ms Kearney insisted the political impasse at Stormont, which has seen Northern Ireland without devolved government for two years, has not disrupted the plans.“What I have seen is once again a fantastic NI PLC getting together and, regardless of what challenges they have, they are single-minded in delivering the safest and best Open and any hurdles that have been presented to date have been quickly overcome,” she said.Tourism NI hopes the Open will help drive Northern Ireland’s golf tourism spend from £ million per year to £ million by , contributing to the overall goal of making the region’s tourist offering a £ billion annual industry.Royal Portrush member John Bamber, who is chairman of the club’s Open Championship committee, said the dream of once again hosting the tournament was approaching reality.“We have been working on the project probably for the best part of  years and sometimes you do have to pinch yourself to think ‘My goodness, it really is going to happen now in the next seven months’,” he said.“It’s been  years and many people thought the Open Championship was very much in the past tense, that it would neverto the shores of Ireland and Northern Ireland here.” Wire\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Royal Portrush Golf Club last hosted the Open Championship in  WireMr Bamber said when the tickets went on sale in July, he and friends had discussed how fast they would go.“We said ‘I wonder what percentage will be sold by Christmas, by Easter, will it sell out ’,” he said.“We all agreed it would sell out, but nobody genuinely really thought that by the start of the autumn there would be no tickets left.“I was totally shocked but, on reflection, I now understand the excitement amongst the community here, the international community, the business community – everybody wants a piece of this and I really am proud to be involved and we have had a terric team here.”He praised his fellow members for agreeing to a redesign of the course that was pivotal to the RA agreeing to an Open .“I believe our wider membership who have embraced his have an enormous sense of pride and satisfaction about seeing their club – remember we are but temporary custodians – but to see their club elevated again to the premier stage,” he said.Mr Bamber added: “It really makes us feel that we have contributed something, that the club itself has given something back to not only the local community but to the country as a whole and there are very few assets around that have that privilege to be able to do that.“It’s something I believe that’s very, very special and perhaps it might only sink in fully after the event has been here in July

Our proposed solutions have been on the table for months.”Mr Juncker said it was up to the British to decidethe final decision is put back to the people in a second referendum or so-called People’s Vote.However he said he was “working on the assumption thatwill leave, because that is what the people of the United Kingdom have decided”.“I have the impression that the majority of British MPs deeply distrust both the EU and Mrs May,” Mr Juncker added.“It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means.

And I think that would put us into unprecedented territory with unknowable consequences.”Campaigners for a second EU referendum seized on the International Trade Secretary’s comments, saying that polls suggested that fewer than % of Britons now want to leave the EU.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a leading supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a referendum, said: “Brexit not happening isn’t - as Liam Fox says.

The deal she’s got is no good.“It will be very, very nerve-wracking for some people and some companies, but at the end of the day we will get a deal and it will be a better one than she has got. That’s where I think it will go and that’s what I think she should do.”Mr Davis dismissed ministers’ warnings of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit as “scare stories”.“The Government is obviously trying to shake us up so we think we have got no choice,” he said.“They are saying to the ones who want Brexit ‘If you don’t vote for this you won’t get Brexit’ and to those who don’t want Brexit ‘If you don’t vote for this you will have the worst sort of Brexit, you will have a hard crash-out’. Both these stories can’t be right.“They are trying to run the clock down.

board the ship are believed to have survived when it smashed into rocks near Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis during the early hours of January , .The men had been ing home to Lewis, Harris and Berneray having survived the First World War.Crowds gathered at the memorial site on Tuesday to mark a century since the disaster.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The ceremony took place at the Iolaire memorial Prince Charles gave a reading at the service and met with descendants, while Ms Sturgeon also spoke with members of the public.They both laid wreaths at a monument which overlooks the scene of the tragedy, as did representatives from emergency services and other organisations.A note left by Charles read: “In special remembrance of your service and sacrice.”Ms Sturgeon said: “As we welcome in the new year, today in Stornoway we rightly look back  years and remember those lost on the Iolaire – a tragedy that involved so many, so close to shore and, for most of the men, so close to home.“We reflect on those who perished and how survivors, family, friends and the wider communities on Lewis, Harris and Berneray must have felt.“It may have been a century ago but the legacy of the Iolaire will never be forgotten.“I was honoured to be part of the commemorations and meet descendants.”Every single village on the Isle of Lewis was affected by the disaster.Lt Alison RossFacebookTwitterPsalms were sang in Gaelic and English during the ceremony, as was the national anthem.Prayers and moments of silence also ran through the event.A new sculpture to commemorate the Iolaire, adjacent to the memorial, was shown Prince Charles.It features a bronze depiction of a coiled heaving line, referencing the acts of John Finlay Macleod who swam out with a rope to rescue  of the  men who were saved.One of the wreath-bearers, Lt Alison Ross of the Royal Navy, is his great-great niece through marriage.The -year-old, of Great Bernera, said: “To do what he did at a time like that is pretty incredible.“I’m so glad I could be here with the Navy, but also with my great-aunt, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the community – it was really quite an honour.“Every single village on the Isle of Lewis was affected by the disaster.“It’s such as shame that people weren’t able to talk about it for decades afterwards.“So it’s really incredible now that  years later the whole community can come together.Artists Will Maclean, Marian Leven and Arthur Watson also unveiled a work which bears the names of those lost and the communities they came from, as well as a bronze wreath composed of maritime insignia.Robert Mackinnon has served in the coastguard for  years and his grandfather – who he is named after – was among the survivors.The -year-old, of Tarbert, said: “I’m here today for two reasons – one  is to lay a wreath on behalf of the coastguard.“The second is my grandfather was a survivor of the Iolaire, who secured a rope and after all that managed to walk  miles back to Harris, during the night, with sleet and howling gale.“You can imagine what was going through his mind after seeing that disaster happen before his eyes.”As events took place on land, a similar commemoration was held on board Caledonian MacBrayne’s MV Loch Seaforth ferry near where the Iolaire hit the rocks.More than  people were on board, including schoolchildren from the Western Isles who threw  red carnations into the sea.The occasion ended with a er taking a wreath to the site where the ship sank."},{"url":null,"title":"revellers shake off 2018 with bracing new

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"the 13 best memes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

leader Alasdair McDonnell has said his advice has not been sought regarding the party#s rumoured merger with Fianna Fail.The one-time MP for South Belfast was speaking after Irish Labour Senator turned SDLP councillor Mairia Cahill described the move as resembling a “takeover”.“Nobody has shared any information with me regarding this situation,” he told the News Letter.“I have not been consulted or my advice sought in any shape or form.”When asked for his personal opinion on a possible amalgamation of the two parties, Dr McDonell added: “My view in all of this is caution until I know what the facts are.”For the full story on how SDLP members say they have been kept “in the dark” about the possible pending merger, see here: Mooted Fianna Fail-SDLP merger ‘looks like a

He said: “Having just twice turned down president Clinton’s offer of a seat on the Supreme Court, Senator Mitchell’s thoughts were understandably not focused principally on Northern Ireland.“The Secretary of State set out the current situation in standard terms and, in answer to a question from Senator Mitchell about what might form the ultimate resolution, explained the talks process and the Government’s interest in securing any solution which commanded the support of the parties.“Nothing was ruled out and nothing ruled in, but it was very unlikely that a majority in Northern Ireland would agree to a united Ireland, so the talks were focusing on the devolution of responsibilities within Northern ireland, the recognition of the Irish identity by means of north south institutions, and keeping open the route to a united Ireland were that ever to become the wish of a majority.”The files declassed at the Public Record Office under the -year rule also show that former US president Jimmy Carter was suggested for the role which would ultimately be taken by Mr Mitchell, that of US peace envoy to Northern Ireland. Jonathan Powell, who would himself have a key role under Tony Blair, was then working in the British Embassy in Washington. He relayed to London that former congressman Bruce Morrison “did not envisage an Irish American filling the role ... he envisaged instead someone completely independent, like Jimmy Carter”.Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ‘odd alliance’ with DUP criticised by NI Tories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

Mr Rees-Mogg has defended his decision, saying there is “little to read in to” him declining the offer to speak at an NI Conservatives fundraiser.Mr Rees-Mogg told the i newspaper: “I am looking forward to being the guest of the DUP in January which I will combine with a visit to the Titanic museum with one of my children.“The chancellor of the exchequer and Boris Johnston addressed the recent DUP conference so it is clear that Tories are allowed to address such events.“As I speak to nearly  Conservative s a year there is little to read in to my refusal to accept a particular invitation.”Alan Dunlop, chairman of the Conservatives in Northern Ireland, suggested Mr Rees-Mogg has made an “odd alliance”.He said: “Backbench MPs are free to speak to anyone they wish to. There is a clear convention within the Conservative Party, however, not to speak in support of rival political parties.“Jacob Rees-Mogg is a highly respected member of the party with impeccable knowledge of UK constitutional politics and conventions and therefore will be fully aware of this.“Sadly on occasions, often in an honest defence of their principle political views, politicians find themselves making odd alliances and standing elements of their own political logic on their heads. They make themselves look foolish when they do so.”Mr Dunlop added: “We will extend understanding to our colleague Jacob on this occasion and hope that when he visits he will accept our invitation for a cup of tea so that we can discuss with him the important political issues facing Northern Ireland in  in detail.”Jacob Rees-Mogg turns down Tories to fundraise for DUP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingDeclassied Files: Downing Street was prepared to give IRA a weapons amnesty in Teenager dies after motorway bridge fallNew Yearrsquos Honours: Devoted and long-serving NI pair recognisedNew Year Honours: Northern Irelandrsquos full list revealedSafety concerns after rocks fall onto road          ..

Only tickets for practice days remain.On a winter planning visit to the course, Mike Woodcock, director of corporate communications at the RA, said the pace at which tickets went took them by surprise.“We were confident there would be huge excitement here but I think even we were staggered by just how much there was when the championship days sold out in two months,” he said.“It was phenomenal really and I think that speaks volumes about the enthusiasm, not only for golf but for sport here in Northern Ireland.“The Open is one of the world’s greatest sporting events, the world’s greatest golfers will be playing here, and I think it’s just fantastic. We’re seeing a real buzz.”Due to the anticipated large crowds, this year’s Open was the first ever all-ticketed event in the Major tournament’s history - , people are expected through the gates.After meeting club officials, tourism bosses, emergency services and other state agencies involved in putting on the tournament, Mr Woodcock said plans were well ahead of schedule.The RA has already predicted that the tournament will deliver an £ million boost to the local economy, through combined direct spend and the value of the media exposure of the destination.“Most of all I think it will be the number of golf fans who will come here from around the world, who have seen images of the Open on television and want to come and play here where they have seen Roryplaying, where they have seen Tigerplaying, and I think that’s what the real benefit is and I think years on from now that will continue,” said Mr Woodcock.Aine Kearney, from Tourism NI, is co-ordinating efforts to deliver Northern Ireland’s first Open in seven decades.“This will be broadcast to  million homes across  countries around the world,” she said.Road deaths in Northern Ireland second lowest since records began Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“And whilst the focus of the attention will be on the golf, what they will also get to see is the absolutely amazing landscape as well as a lot of the stories of the experiences that the players are having, the media are having - you can’t buy that level of exposure.“That’s why hosting global major events has been such a critical part to our long-term growth strategy and we believe it’s firmly one of the reasons why we are within touching point of becoming a £ billion industry.“It’s all about getting those positive messages out - to change the narrative about Northern Ireland and show the people of the world what an exciting, vibrant and beautul place this is to come and visit.”Ms Kearney insisted the political impasse at Stormont, which has seen Northern Ireland without devolved government for two years, has not disrupted the plans.“What I have seen is once again a fantastic NI PLC getting together and, regardless of what challenges they have, they are single-minded in delivering the safest and best Open and any hurdles that have been presented to date have been quickly overcome,” she said.Tourism NI hopes the Open will help drive Northern Ireland’s golf tourism spend from £ million per year to £ million by , contributing to the overall goal of making the region’s tourist offering a £ billion annual industry.Royal Portrush member John Bamber, who is chairman of the club’s Open Championship committee, said the dream of once again hosting the tournament was approaching reality.“We have been working on the project probably for the best part of  years and sometimes you do have to pinch yourself to think ‘My goodness, it really is going to happen now in the next seven months’,” he said.“It’s been  years and many people thought the Open Championship was very much in the past tense, that it would neverto the shores of Ireland and Northern Ireland here.”Mr Bamber said when the tickets went on sale in July, he and friends had discussed how fast they would go.“We said ‘I wonder what percentage will be sold by Christmas, by Easter, will it sell out ’,” he said.“We all agreed it would sell out, but nobody genuinely really thought that by the start of the autumn there would be no tickets left.“I was totally shocked but, on reflection, I now understand the excitement amongst the community here, the international community, the business community - everybody wants a piece of this and I really am proud to be involved and we have had a terric team here.”He praised his fellow members for agreeing to a redesign of the course that was pivotal to the RA agreeing to an Open .“I believe our wider membership who have embraced this have an enormous sense of pride and satisfaction about seeing their club - remember we are but temporary custodians - but to see their club elevated again to the premier stage,” he said.Mr Bamber added: “It really makes us feel that we have contributed something, that the club itself has given something back to not only the local community but to the country as a whole and there are very few assets around that have that privilege to be able to do that.“It’s something I believe that’s very, very special and perhaps it might only sink in fully after the event has been here in July .”try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shersquod always challenge an idea or an argumentshe wasnrsquot convinced by it.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

iolaire centenary commemorations","story":"Only ofthe passengers on board the ship are believed to have survived when it smashed into rocks near Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis during the early hours of January , .The men had been ing home to Lewis, Harris and Berneray having survived the First World War.Crowds gathered at the memorial site on Tuesday to mark a century since the disaster.The ceremony took place at the Iolaire memorial Prince Charles gave a reading at the service and met with descendants, while Ms Sturgeon also spoke with members of the public.They both laid wreaths at a monument which overlooks the scene of the tragedy, as did representatives from emergency services and other organisations.A note left by Charles read: ldquoIn special remembrance of your service and sacrice.Ms Sturgeon said:ldquoAs we welcome in the new year, today in Stornoway we rightly look back  years and remember those lost on the Iolaire ndash a tragedy that involved so many, so close to shore and, for most of the men, so close to home.ldquoWe reflect on those who perished and how survivors, family, friends and the wider communities on Lewis, Harris and Berneray must have felt.ldquoIt may have been a century ago but the legacy of the Iolaire will never be forgotten.ldquoI was honoured to be part of the commemorations and meet descendants.Psalms were sang in Gaelic and English during the ceremony, as was the national anthem.Prayers and moments of silence also ran through the event.A new sculpture to commemorate the Iolaire, adjacent to the memorial, was shown Prince Charles.It features a bronze depiction of a coiled heaving line, referencing the acts of John Finlay Macleod who swam out with a rope to rescue  of the  men who were saved.One of the wreath-bearers, Lt Alison Ross of the Royal Navy, is his great-great niece through marriage.The -year-old, of Great Bernera, said: ldquoTo do what he did at a time like that is pretty incredible.ldquoIrsquom so glad I could be here with the Navy, but also with my great-aunt, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the community ndash it was really quite an honour.ldquoEvery single village on the Isle of Lewis was affected by the disaster.ldquoItrsquos such as shame that people werenrsquot able to talk about it for decades afterwards.ldquoSo itrsquos really incredible now that  years later the whole community can come together.Artists Will Maclean, Marian Leven and Arthur Watson also unveiled a work which bears the names of those lost and the communities they came from, as well as a bronze wreath composed of maritime insignia.Robert Mackinnon has served in the coastguard for  years and his grandfather ndash who he is named after ndash was among the survivors.The -year-old, of Tarbert, said: ldquoIrsquom here today for two reasons ndash one is to lay a wreath on behalf of the coastguard.ldquoThe second is my grandfather was a survivor of the Iolaire, who secured a rope and after all that managed to walk  miles back to Harris, during the night, with sleet and howling gale.ldquoYou can imagine what was going through his mind after seeing that disaster happen before his eyes.As events took place on land, a similar commemoration was held on board Caledonian MacBraynersquos MV Loch Seaforth ferry near where the Iolaire hit the rocks.More than  people were on board, including schoolchildren from the Western Isles who threw  red carnations into the sea.The occasion ended with a er taking a wreath to the site where the ship sank..push,i[r].l*new
