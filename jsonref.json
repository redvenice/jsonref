There were racist, sexist and homophobic jokes and stereotype references.\u0027The script of the show was not seen or approved by anyone in authority at the university, nor by the Student Union.\u0027Police were called in to investigate but decided that no further action would be taken. Two students involved in the blacking up admitted a lack of sensitivity.Cardiff University says a \u0027wide range of support\u0027 was offered to students in the aftermath of the play.A spokesperson said: \u0027What the university does recognise is that it failed to forsee the depth of reaction and feeling amongst the medical cohort of students and that we were unable to influence or intervene in a manner that was able to prevent the very deep hurt caused by the breakdown in friendships and peer group relationships that we know impacted so heavily on some members of the complainant group.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Thousands Wuhan drinkers flaunt social distancing rules enjoy week long beer festival","story":"Share this articleBeer festival in Wuhan is a success despite overseas controversy - CGTN"},{"url":null,"title":"Beiruts port finally opens aid shipments","story":"Share this articleBeirut Explosion Likely Sparked by Maintenance at Warehouse, According to U.S. Assessment - WSJ"},{"url":null,"title":"BTEC students promised results end week amid minute delay","story":"Share this article\u0027This summer has been a disaster for the Government, it has left students panicking about their future and colleges in turmoil. Williamson must resign and Boris Johnson must return to deal with this crisis.\u0027 Yesterday exams regulator Ofqual said its algorithm used in A-levels and GCSEs was not used for the majority of vocational and technical qualifications (VTQ) - including BTECs.But in a statement tonight, England\u0027s exams watchdog said some exam boards, including OCR and Pearson, will \u0027need more time\u0027 to recalculate results.It said: \u0027OCR have said that their Cambridge National results will issue next week.\u0027Pearson, which initially did not think there would need to be significant changes made, has now decided to revise its arrangements to ensure that students\u0027 qualification-level results better reflect the unit-level results that students have already secured through internally assessed units.\u0027Ofqual added: \u0027Everyone is working as quickly as possible to confirm results as soon as possible, recognising the impact that delays are having on schools, colleges and students. No learner\u0027s result will go down as a consequence of regrading.\u0027Yesterday, Mr Hughes said: \u0027The timing is worrying, because thousands of students were due to get their results in the morning and others have already got results which we know will not go down, but which might improve.\u0027So it is vital for students that this is sorted in days rather than weeks so that students have the chance to celebrate and to plan their next steps. It is a stressful time and this delay will extend the uncertainties.\u0027 He added: \u0027Those students wanting to move onto further or higher education will be most worried about losing out on places.\u0027We are in close communication with DfE, Ofqual and Pearson to particularly make sure that BTEC students applying for universities can still be treated fairly.\u0027Leora Cruddas, chief executive of the Confederation of School Trusts, said: \u0027This late notification will cause very significant challenges for schools, trusts and colleges.\u0027It simply is unacceptable that some of the most disadvantaged students will not receive their grades tomorrow and that nothing has been done to correct this over the past few days.\u0027Dr Greg Walker, chief executive at the MillionPlus group of universities said: \u0027We must ensure that other learners and applicants are not forgotten. \u0027These include BTEC and other applied generals students whose grades may now be delayed for a significant period to rightly ensure they will be on a par with A-level candidates.\u0027Both the Government and universities should ensure that these applicants don\u0027t get squeezed out in these unprecedented circumstances.\u0027 The National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and College Union (UCU) have also voiced concerns. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: \u0027Our priority is to ensure all students are treated fairly, including those who received vocational and technical results last week, such as BTECs and Cambridge Technicals.\u0027These subjects are rightly assessed differently to A-levels, and the overwhelming majority of results are in line with centre assessment grades.\u0027A minority of vocational and technical qualifications used a statistical model similar to the one Ofqual used for A-levels and GCSEs, and Ofqual has asked these awarding organisations to review their approaches to make sure no student is disadvantaged.\u0027   "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f29d61c10cc02ba03dfab64d8783edcc6a9971/0_393_5930_3560/master/5930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7efad45dc4cb5fa856f2a4424be1a30","title":"loved and lost simon bray photo essay","story":"Photographer Simon Bray’s project Loved and Lost deals with the loss of loved ones. He asked each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one, and they returned to the location to replicate the image. The project aims to provide a platform, allowing others to acknowledge their loss, and to celebrate the person they loveDeath has a stigma and the burden of grief can hold us captive if we let it. May this be a process through which a loved one can be remembered and through which memories can be relived. Even though the pain of the loss may remain, may this go some way in relieving the hurt and the stigma of death and act as a public declaration that death has lost its sting.I ask each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one. We then return to the location of the original photograph to replicate the image.It is a chance to think back and remember, to tell the story of that day and of the person that they have lost. Imagery allows for expression beyond what we can speak of. I hope it is an experience that contributes to the restorative process in overcoming the painful impact of loss.We all have a different experience of loss that can reveal itself in many ways. Sometimes it’s a response that is quite clear for those around you to see. Perhaps there are lots of emotions that they just don’t know how to let out, they’re not sure how they should be feeling or whether it’s right to be having certain angry or complicated thoughts.It’s not about having the best photo, saying the right thing or having the answers, I just want to give people a chance to speak about their experience of loss.My aim was that the combination of the photos we took and the conversations we had, we would be able to portray a deep personal story. This allows other people who are struggling and going through similar experiences to look through and find strength and comfort in the story, knowing that other people have been through it and are confident enough to share their story.I lost my father to prostate cancer in December 2009. When my dad died, it wounded me in the deepest part of my being. The loss shaped the following few years of my life and will continue to do so, but I don’t have to let it define who I am. Through this time, it was really helpful to be able to talk about my dad. I wanted to share with others about the person he was, the emotions I was feeling as I processed the grief, and talk about the influence he had – and continues to have – on my life. Those conversations were often hard and few and far between, mainly because people just didn’t quite know how to respond.I’m Alistair, and my dad was James. The original picture was from the beach at Swanage in Dorset. I’m not sure how old I was there, but it was a family holiday. We loved to go down there and find a pitch for the day, Mum and Dad would soak up the sun and me and Tim, my brother, would build sandcastles and splash around, and repeat until we had to go home.He was a very loving father, he provided for his family, looked after us. He taught me a lot of principles about always doing the best, always trying to be the nicest person and to make sure that others were looked after and cared for. When you look back you realise you’ve been prepared by your parents to live your life. Dad always just wanted to treat others how he’d want to be treated.When we got the dementia diagnosis, several years ago, we had noticed over time that he was getting more forgetful. He wouldn’t use my name, he was losing his hearing, his vision wasn’t great and I lost him as a dad over those years. I still loved him as my dad, but I knew I wasn’t necessarily going to get that reciprocated, which was tough. He still offered to help when I mentioned to him about moving flat he’d say “well let me know if you need a hand”. I think that’s just his character through and through and I always just try to emulate that.I went to see him in the care home and I said to the staff that I’d like to volunteer in the garden if possible, even if he wasn’t aware of me being there, I could just help out and spend some time with him, but then we went into lockdown and that was the last time I saw him when he was awake and alert.When the Covid thing came along, it was like losing him for a second time, but this time, obviously, for the last time. It was difficult because I had kind of processed losing him in a mental sense, and now I was losing him in a physical sense.I did get to see him before he passed away and it was just a completely different experience because I had to wear all the PPE. In the past, I’d just always assumed he’d be there for years to come and you don’t think about it ever being the last time, whereas I went there, got dressed up and they said you’ve got 15 minutes. It was horrible having this countdown clock, where you have this time limit on how long you have left with someone. I just set it on my watch and it’s just counting down. I was thinking, I’ve got 30 seconds left with my dad, 20 seconds left, 10 seconds left. What do I do? What do I say? And I just panicked.It made me reflect on how many times I’ve seen or called my parents and thought that maybe I’m quite busy and I haven’t really got time for this, but I’ll see them next week. I’ve gone away thinking that it’s OK that I didn’t see them for very long today because I’ll see them in the future.It’s given me a real appreciation for just taking a second to appreciate that when you’re with family or a friend, that you don’t know necessarily when you might see them again and that’s why you have to make the most of the time you have with them. I’m trying to act on it in a positive way, rather than just thinking about why I feel that way because of Dad.It’s absolutely OK to cry and be a blubbering mess sometimes. If you try to stop it, you’ll feel a lot worse. I know that particularly for men there’s this societal pressure to be a strong support and a rock for people, but for your own sake, for men and women, to let your body do what it needs to do. You want to cry because your brain is telling you that you need to process this, to not fight it but to let it happen, then you’ll feel that pressure is unloaded.My name is Jonathan. The picture of myself and dad was taken on Christmas Eve 2019. We’d had Christmas together for the previous 54 years and it was a tradition we never broke. It was a fabulous event, we went out for a meal and then came back and exchanged gifts here.My dad was 88 and he was getting old, things were failing. As a son it’s really upsetting when parents get older. I would do anything to try and make his life easier. I saw that he was walking badly and he said that the flesh on his feet was getting thinner and thinner and it was painful to walk. He’d never been into a Nike store, but he hobbled in, and then pretty soon we were having him trying on lots of pairs and we fitted him up with a pair of Nike Air Max. He was virtually running around the store, which was really lovely, really heartening. I felt as though I’d knocked off 10 or 15 years!He was so busy, I couldn’t keep up with him. I’m half his age, but he was out every night of the week. He would attend choirs, he was in the Greater Manchester Police Choir, the church choir, he was in Probus. I just don’t think he liked being at home.He was the person I’d known longest in my life, he was always there. He was a bit like Switzerland, he never really offered a view, but he was always there to support me and catch me if I fell or tripped. It’s three months since he died and I’ve spent the last three months going to call him every day. So it’s been difficult.He was the 12th coronavirus victim in the UK, so it was right at the very start. The health service and society as a whole didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know how to process and deal with the virus at that stage. So that was really difficult, because we couldn’t go to see him. We were only allowed to see him at the very end with lots of protective equipment, but if he hadn’t have had the coronavirus he probably would have been here today, because they would have treated his underlying health issues. It’s really, really difficult.He died on Friday 13th, which I just couldn’t believe. The last time I saw him, we’d had a chat and I’d said what a cool dad he was, that he’d done a really good job, and he said, “No, I don’t think I was that good”, which I thought was really sweet. I said goodbye to him and went into the anteroom, where I had to take off all the protective equipment. I was halfway through taking it off and he called me back, but I couldn’t go back because the room had a positive air pressure, so I’ll never know what he wanted me for. That went with him to the grave.It sounds really strange, but it’ll be very odd when the pandemic ends, because it has felt like a very intimate time, in that we went into shutdown and I could think about my dad’s experience, but it was like a shared experience with the whole of the world. I dread to think of other families going through the same thing that we went through. When someone dies of cancer or a heart attack, it’s dreadful, but that’s the moment. Whereas my dad died on the 13 March and from that point on, coronavirus has been on the news every minute of every hour of every day. It was like someone sticking a knife into the wound all the time, there was no escaping from it. As a family we felt properly battered.Normally if you suffer a bereavement you have the support of family and friends, and we couldn’t go and see anyone. We were in lockdown before the country, in our own lockdown, so it’s been a very lonely time. Every step along the way was difficult, it felt as though we were unfortunate pioneers. The first funeral director that we went to wouldn’t deal with us. It’s been unusual.At his funeral, we only had 10 people there and I liked it because it was nice and quiet. I’d discovered tapes of him singing so we actually played him singing a song on the way out and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. That was really magical.My name is Philip and the photograph is of me and my parents. We bought this caravan in 2016, and they were very much part of our lives, so they would come for a weekend. We are in the very north of Anglesey. If you think of the island as a clock, then we’re at 1 o’clock, overlooking the most northerly lighthouse, Point Lynas.My dad was a travelling salesman for James Stewart and Co in Ardwick, opposite Manchester Apollo. His turf was Moss Side. He used to sell from a catalogue going door to door and he was well known in the area. He did that for 30-odd years.My mum brought us up, two boys who liked to fight and liked to be boys. She was also the bursar at the Ryleys school in Alderley Edge, and was very into amateur dramatics, so was part of the Wilmslow Green Room Society. She was in a lot of plays, then did a lot of backstage and in her older years did a lot of wardrobe, so there’s a team of six that meet every Tuesday to talk and sort the wardrobes out.Mum had coughs, she definitely had Covid.She was fit and healthy, walking a mile a day, in the drama group. Dad was playing golf and doing the garden, but he died of a broken heart, basically. Even though he did test positive, he never had a cough or any real symptoms. I lost both parents in 48 hours. My family is my world, so the only reassurance is that we were telling them to stay in, eat and have the paracetamol and do what the doctor says, that they’d get through it and to be strong.My brother still lived with my parents and had to give CPR to both of them. They were in lockdown, so even after both parents dying, Peter had to stay in the house for another five days and we weren’t allowed to visit. It’s all that stuff that you don’t hear about and have no idea what people are going through. To this day, he has not had any symptoms. He’s never been tested, nobody approached him, but he’s never had a day of illness. We were only allowed 10 people at the funeral when we could have had 200. We printed 100 orders of service and posted them out to different people, just so there was something for them to share on the day. We did a video, so we can share that with people, but obviously nobody got the funeral that they wanted.For the first three weeks after my parents died, I became a bit of a counsellor. People would ring me up and I’d have to explain everything and say well, we have to look for the silver lining in it all, we have to find something every day that helps and is a positive. We’ve done that, we have managed to find that glimmer, even little quirky things, memories of them, thoughts of them.I suppose the only comfort is that there isn’t an answer. There isn’t something that we could or should have done to make the result anything different than what it was, because nobody had that knowledge. Everybody was scared and there are still friends of my mum and dad that haven’t gone out.We summed it up quite nicely in that if somebody else came into the room, that person became the most important person. So it was never about them, they were the host and hostess. Drop everything, someone’s come in, what can I do for you, get you a drink, something to eat, oven on, and we’ll look after you, tell us what’s going on in your life, is there something we can help with?I used to sit and watch every United game with my dad, we were avid football fans and we’d chat away, so the first time I watched United I put a glass of white wine next to me. That’s what makes it tough sometimes, those chats, those little bits that fill in your week. It’s good to talk it out, you have to do that.I’m just so pleased that they saw both my daughters get firsts, graduate and be in the jobs they want to be in. They burst with pride about my girls. I’ve tried to do the best to acknowledge them and pay them tribute, and if we can be half the people they were, then we’re doing a good job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7e0bf020385a47d51b259f390f24c6b68ddad6/419_222_2721_1632/master/2721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4632d1b8d55753fa79efb627847a603","title":"picture essay america 1930s post office murals","story":"Photographer Justin Hamel stumbled on a Great Depression-era mural one day in a New York post office, and was intrigued to learn there are 1,200 of them across the countryThe instinct to try to boost morale during a time of hardship and suffering resonates today as we face the pandemic and economic recession.Modeled on the 1933 Public Works Art Project, the federal government created the Treasury Section of Painting and Sculpture a year later (the name was subsequently changed to the Section of Fine Arts).These programs were designed to employ artists.The mission of the post office murals was multifaceted – to boost morale in communities, employ artists by the thousands and create world-class art that was accessible to everyone. The murals revolved around local folklore, landscapes, industry and, unsurprisingly, mail delivery. They told the story of life across the United States.The first mural I photographed occurred by happenstance – I stumbled upon a mural depicting the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. From there the project slowly grew, as I traveled around the country seeking out the unique art of the post office mural.I’ve now photographed about 325 inidual murals though I don’t have an actual tally.From the magnificent depiction of steam engines being built in the post office in Willard, Ohio, to a serene pondside landscape hanging in the sheriff’s office in Dale county, Alabama, or covered wagons crossing a stream in Crawford, Nebraska, each new mural I discovered offered an engaging view into the local histories of the world around us.In small towns everywhere, history was painted by people who arrived in America seeking a better life. Many of the artists employed by the Section were immigrants. José Aceves, a Mexican-American artist, painted the classic western scene Big City News in Borger, Texas.New and Old Methods of Transportation, showing how the rapid pace at which technology was changing rural towns, was painted by the Polish-American Bernard Zakheim in Mineola, Texas. In a Virginia post office lobby, you’ll find a factory valley landscape entitled Appalachia by Lucienne Bloch, a Swiss-born immigrant.As today’s national discussion in the US has shifted towards institutional racism and the place of art and statues commemorating the United States’ racist history, many post office murals are coming under scrutiny for the way they portray the colonization and slavery. Hollis Holbrook’s John Elliot Speaks to the Natick Indians depicts Native Americans enslaved by Puritans while John Elliot preaches Christianity to them.The city of Natick was founded as the first of many “praying towns” by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where Native Americans would be forced to learn Christianity.However, the controversy surrounding post office murals is arguably nothing new. In the 1950s, a handful of artists were made to testify under the House committee on un-American activities for their celebration of labor and political undertones.Victor Arnautoff’s historic 10-panel The Life of Washington mural at the George Washington high school in San Francisco is in the midst of a fierce fight to be preserved, hidden or destroyed due to its depictions of George Washington as a slave owner and the dead Native Americans the country was founded upon. Hundreds of murals created under the Section of Fine Arts and the broader Works Progress Administration have been lost or purposely destroyed over the years.The Section of Fine Arts created roughly 1,400 murals and sculptures in federal buildings, not entirely post offices. The PWAP, Treasury Relief Art and Federal Art Project commissioned thousands of other paintings, posters, general art classes, etc, including post office murals.All wrapped into one, it is undoubtedly the largest public art project in the US. The most recent politicization of the post office has brought renewed focus to the ways the postal service is crucial to everyday life. Perhaps an unexpected consequence, scaling back hours and funding will also put this unparalleled collection of public art at risk.• Justin Hamel is a documentary and editorial photographer in El Paso, Texas, working at the intersections of climate, labor and migration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/262bd47df0273479ce12d1d4acff1b965c4f27a8/98_0_2805_1684/master/2805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd758df1e35b1129e4b16cea55a4e28","title":"matt herron chronicler of the us civil rights movement in pictures","story":"The photographer, who covered protesters and volunteers across the south, has died at 89.

The ONS said the July borrowing figures ranked as the fourth highest borrowing in any month since records began in 1993.Since April, the beginning of the fiscal year, the UK has borrowed £150bn, an increase of £128bn on a year ago.Most of the increase can be attributed to the government’s rescue programmes to support the health service and fight the virus, while also making up for a plunge in tax revenues as companies and households hunkered down to ride out the pandemic.The ONS said: “The coronavirus pandemic continues to have a significant impact on the UK public sector finances. These effects arise from both the introduction of public health measures and from new government policies to support businesses and iniduals.”The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s independent economic forecaster, said earlier this year that it expected the government to borrow £322bn this year.Over the past four months, the UK has borrowed almost as much it did in the 12 months after the financial crisis. The deficit surged to almost £160bn in the 2009-2010 financial year because of the cost of bailing out the banks and handling a deep recession."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9efaa35c16bb92edeb964da1bd7dc4fc3729b7e2/0_148_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef18b064f9aee399020f0636160412fd","title":"covid recovery in eurozone stalls dimming hopes of v shaped climb back","story":"August PMIs for services and manufacturing show retreat from July’s bouncebackThe eurozone’s recovery from its deepest economic downturn on record hit the brakes in August, as pent-up demand unleashed by the easing of coronavirus lockdowns dwindled, according to a closely watched survey.After many of the initial Covid-19 restrictions were relaxed, activity in the eurozone expanded in July at the fastest pace since mid-2018. But as infection rates have risen again in parts of the region, some earlier curbs have been reinstated.The latest data, which was published on Friday and focused on the services and manufacturing sectors, is likely to concern policymakers and diminish hopes for a V-shaped recovery, signalling slowing growth. IHS Markit’s flash composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell from 54.9 in July to 51.6. Any number above 50 signals growth.“The fallback in the eurozone composite PMI in August suggests the initial V-shaped rebound following the lifting of the lockdowns is already fizzling out,” said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.The flow of new business for firms slowed and once again some of August’s activity was derived by companies completing work backlogs. Germany and France, the bloc’s two biggest economies, also lost economic momentum this month, driven by a services slowdown.Apart from those economies, activity decreased marginally in August, IHS Markit said.Growth in the eurozone’s dominant service sector stalled, with the its PMI index falling to 50.1 from 54.7.With demand waning, the bloc’s services firms cut headcount for a sixth month in a row, and more sharply than in July. Economists noted the employment components of the PMIs suggested more gloom ahead in the jobs market.“Those numbers indicate that the worst is yet to be seen in the euro area labour market and clearly points to a gradual recovery path,” said Tuuli Koivu at Nordea Markets.Factory activity – which did not experience quite as sharp a decline as the service industry during the height of the pandemic – expanded for a second month.But in a sign that factory purchasing managers do not expect a big pick up in activity, they again bought fewer raw materials than in the previous month.EU leaders agreed last month a €750bn (£674bn) pandemic recovery fund, but the relief does not kick in until next year. For its part, the European Central Bank is expected to keep monetary policy ultra-loose for a long time.A full bounceback from the eurozone’s deepest recession on record will take two years or more, according to a recent Reuters poll of economists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/242b06ef83e32e648ca5d111f148b78b9ca6e112/0_63_3220_1931/master/3220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be3e66ef7be9ab1edfcc6375d639bcf0","title":"reek corruption british politics discontent democracy","story":"Will our politicians call big banks to account if the same firms are likely to feather their nests when they leave the cabinet?You have to hand it to Sajid Javid. Six months ago, the MP for Bromsgrove was on his uppers, having stormed out of Number 11 Downing St after refusing Dominic Cummings’s diktat to sack his advisers. Now, in the teeth of a global recession, Javid has scored a shiny new job – as an adviser for JP Morgan.How much the former chancellor is being paid by the US bank is unclear. The salary is widely reported as “undisclosed”. But we can be sure it’s more than pocket money. Not bad if you already have a job as a public representative that comes with basic pay north of £80,000.Javid, of course, is not alone in cashing in from his time in Westminster while sitting on the green benches. Theresa May – still the MP for Maidenhead – has earned more than £1m on the international lecture circuit since resigning as prime minister a year ago. The former Tory leader – not exactly renowned as a great public speaker – was even paid £56,000 for an online talk delivered during lockdown.When I finished writing my new book, Democracy for Sale, earlier this year I wondered – at least for a moment – whether I was being too harsh on British politicians. Maybe I was overstating the power of money and influence in our politics. Maybe the system wasn’t as corrupt as I thought.Recent events, however, suggest that if anything my diagnosis about the rotten state of British politics was too kind. From Robert Jenrick’s “apparent bias” over Tory donor Richard Desmond’s lucrative planning application to Boris Johnson’s decision to ennoble his own brother and a cast of cronies, and the doling out of public contracts to political allies, there is less a whiff of corruption about this government and more a stench so powerful it can no longer be ignored.Meanwhile, the revolving door in British politics spins so fast it’s often hard to keep track of who is coming and who is going. In 2018 alone, more than 200 former ministers and senior civil servants took up roles advising and lobbying for different businesses. Within six months of resigning as Brexit secretary, David Davis was earning £3,000 an hour as an “external adviser” to JCB – itself a major donor to the Conservative party. Prior to the 2019 general election, former environment secretary Owen Paterson contacted ministers and officials on behalf of companies that he was paid £112,000 to advise. (Paterson said his financial interests “have been correctly declared according to the rules of the House of Commons”.)The personal connections between politicians and corporate interests have seldom been stronger. A fifth of new Conservative MPs elected in 2019 previously worked as lobbyists.At the other end of their careers, countless senior politicians have walked straight into top corporate jobs, from Nick Clegg as VP at Facebook to George Osborne’s lucrative role at BlackRock, the world’s largest investment firm. (Osborne, of course, moved in a short space of time from being the chancellor to editing the Evening Standard, which is owned by Evgeny Lebedev, the Russian press baron elevated to the Lords by the prime minister last month. Osborne’s successor at the Standard, meanwhile, is Emily Sheffield, whose brother-in-law is David Cameron. It’s a small world.)Parliament’s anti-corruption watchdog, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), is a feeble instrument that seldom, if ever, stands in the way of politicians taking plum jobs outside government. In the case of Javid, Acoba warned that the former chancellor’s “privileged access to information” meant accepting a job with JP Morgan carried “potential risks” – but still gave the green light anyway.The prime minister himself has shown scant regard for the threadbare rules that are supposed to protect the integrity of our politics. In 2018, Acoba criticised Johnson for not asking its advice before renewing his contract as a columnist at the  just three days after resigning as foreign minister. Johnson was allowed to keep the job, with its £275,000 annual salary.Such eye-watering sums only serve to feed voters’ growing mistrust of politics. Will our politicians be willing to anger big banks and Silicon Valley if the same firms are likely to feather their nests almost as soon as they sit up from the cabinet table? The implicit message from such large firms may be that if you keep out of our way, there’ll be a nicely paid gig waiting for you when leaving high office.The good news is that the system could be cleaned up. A ban on MPs taking second jobs would be a reasonable place to start – as Labour MP Zarah Sultana recently outlined on these pages.The bad news is that major reform requires political will. Right now, that seems about as likely as a week passing without another revelation of government sleaze.• Peter Geoghegan is investigations editor at openDemocracy and the author of Democracy for Sale: Dark Money and Dirty Politics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c1613f4f894128f664ee5e5c9183d3ca039533/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fea2aed5d3470cb8087bdd4e0211a491","title":"the guardian view on play streets where asphalt meets grassroots","story":"Opening up more roads for safe games and socialising has been one good thing to come out of the pandemic Play is a serious business. It is essential for children’s learning, mental wellbeing and life skills such as teamwork. But outside of organised sport and early years education, where play is central, policymakers rarely address what is mainly seen as a private matter. This year, the closure of nurseries, schools and playgrounds during the pandemic has reminded us all that withdrawing opportunities for play can be a risk to children’s social and emotional as well as physical health. Manchester, Tameside and Westminster are among English councils to have responded by taking advantage of rules introduced last year that make it easier to turn streets into play areas, closing them off to cars for set periods.Covid-19 has increased the demand for outdoor exercise and green space, particularly among urban dwellers who don’t have gardens. This need is even more pronounced during summer holidays that for many children, this year, are simply a continuation of what went before. Pressure on parks and other public spaces such as beaches has been intense. The poorest families are the least likely to have access to space where children can play. This longstanding issue reached its apogee last year in the scandal of segregated playgrounds in housing developments, open to families who own properties but not those in social housing.Street play, so much more common in the past, when traffic levels were lower, cannot solve all these problems. But it is by definition on people’s doorsteps it lends itself to social distancing more easily than many playgrounds, where children cluster around pieces of equipment and it enables them to access toilets in their homes.The impact on children of the past six months remains to be ascertained. What is certain is that it has been felt by millions and that it has been wildly uneven. This differential effect is certain to increase as many families are faced with extreme hardship due to the loss of jobs and income. Making more outdoor space available to children is a small thing, seen against this backdrop. But while most public realm improvements cost money, play streets don’t. And at a point of enormous pressure on council budgets, affecting leisure services, this is another reason to take notice of them.The idea that, at certain times, play should take precedence over traffic is not universally accepted. For some, it is part of a wider agenda of promoting healthier streets by encouraging walking and cycling, and reducing car use. Low-traffic residential areas with high numbers of families were among early adopters when the scheme began in Bristol just over a decade ago. But it has also been tried on high-rise estates.The need for play, fresh air, exercise and social contact has to be balanced against the risk of infection. The public consultations and meetings so necessary to community action have been made harder by Covid-19. But at a time when so much of value is shrinking, and opportunities for enjoyable, social activity have reduced, there is relief and encouragement to be found in play streets: a creative idea for positive change that is making headway, from the bottom up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd5b3c7e983886d21ba0549cd57b574c01eba768/46_0_1449_870/master/1449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0765913ef6db66953e0d44ef591094b","title":"stephen colbert biden dnc speech late show recap","story":"Late-night hosts react to Biden’s emotional acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination and the arrest of Steve BannonThe weeklong virtual Democratic national convention culminated on Thursday evening with Joe Biden’s official acceptance of the nomination for president in a moving, emotional speech on loss in a dark night for America. “Well, here’s the deal,” said Stephen Colbert airing live afterwards. “Biden spoke for over 10 minutes and addressed all the pain that Trump has inflicted upon our country, all the possibilities for healing our nation. But most importantly, not once did he whine about shower pressure.“Throughout the convention, it was a common theme: Joe Biden’s history of loss and suffering,” the Late Show host said. “Surprisingly, we didn’t get a lot of jokes out of it, but there was a reason the convention hammered this point home: to cast Joe Biden in stark contrast with Donald Trump. Donald Trump couldn’t overcome any of the challenges of his presidency because he’s never had to overcome anything at all.”“This is the grownup version of the college essay that asks you to write about a challenge you’ve faced,” Colbert added, “and instead of scrambling to put together a story about bouncing back from getting second chair in your high-school a cappella group, Joe Biden has a real answer.”In his speech, Biden reflected on his own personal losses – his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46, his first wife Neilia and young daughter Naomi, who died in a car accident in 1972 – and carrying on through grief. “Your loved ones may have left this Earth, but they never leave your heart,” he said. “They will always be with you.”The vulnerable, empathetic speech showed Biden to be “a man who is decent, compassionate, flawed but honest – and that is water in the desert”, said Colbert. “He’s the sort of person who thinks before he says things, and when he gaffes, which he does often, it’s because his heart gets ahead of his words. He cares. And he tries his hardest.“He’s like a lot of people I know, and you do too. Which shouldn’t seem remarkable, but right now it is. And when Trump tweets his all-caps rebuke tomorrow morning, he’s just going to show how our president is not presidential. But Joe Biden is.”On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah recapped the third night of the Democratic convention, in which former president Barack Obama delivered a “brutal” speech that got “straight to the point”.For four years, Donald Trump has “shown no interest in putting in the work”, Obama said in his grave address, “no interest in finding common ground no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends no interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn’t grown into the job because he can’t.“Not even being mean about it – Obama was just laying out why President Trump has failed in a real and honest way,” Noah said. “I know he’s too classy for this, but I think Obama would make a great Yelper,” he added, imagining a “Barack O” Yelp review of a restaurant: “Vincenzo’s Quality Italian has no interest in making a great meatball sub. They won’t ever grow into your fave calzone joint because they can’t.”The speech “didn’t feel like the usual ‘things are gonna get better’ Obama speech”, Noah said. “It felt more like a funeral for democracy. Basically, four years of Trump took Obama from ‘yes we can’ to ‘let us pray’.”And on Late Night, Seth Meyers reacted to shocking news that former Trump adviser and “human pimple” Steve Bannon was arrested on Thursday morning for allegedly skimming over $1m from “We Build the Wall”, an online fundraising campaign for the president’s proposed border wall with Mexico.It’s been a “brutal six months, so I’m gonna mainline some schadenfreude”, Meyers said of the news, which he called a “perfect encapsulation of the Trump era”.“From beginning to end, the wall was a non-stop scam,” Meyers continued. “Trump scammed his supporters by telling them Mexico would pay for it, then we ended up paying for it. Then this baked potato Fabio over here” – a sunburned Bannon – “said he’d pay for it, then he scammed everyone again by allegedly skimming money from it. It’s a Russian nesting doll of fraud.”Even funnier to Meyers was the fact that Bannon was arrested on a luxury yacht off the coast of Connecticut by federal officials and agents from the US Postal Inspection Service.“Think about how perfect this is: the same public agency Trump is currently trying to destroy, one of the most cherished public institutions in America, arrested his former campaign manager for allegedly skimming money from a fundraiser for their scam border wall,” said Meyers.And given that Bannon’s arrest occurred two days after a Senate intelligence report confirmed that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort shared sensitive campaign data with a Russian intelligence official, Meyers added, “it’s like the end of the summer TV season and they’re wrapping up all the story arcs at once”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9badd696cf7250b942409a58df622affc1797640/0_289_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602a2b8c1e724b8e0c625a814c0ebe58","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.

Rather than being judged by their exam performance, their grades had been assigned by a computer model that took into account their previous achievements and that of their school.  As Laura McInerney tells Mythili Rao, while at first glance the results last week looked in line with a normal school year, glaring anomalies and what looked to be huge injustices emerged. As pressure built on the government to explain itself, ministers went silent before the education secretary emerged on Monday to announce a major U-turn.

Bees also produce propolis, a resin-like compound with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, that Rowberry says makes a “very good mouthwash”.Hooper was inspired to start her Beeutiful skincare range after she read of honey being used to treat soldiers’ wounds in the first and second world wars. She says a popular balm has been effective in soothing skin conditions and insect bites.“With plastic-free, use less, recycle more, I feel like more people are going ‘Hang on, maybe I don’t need to go to a pharmacist’,” says Hooper.Co-author Dr Joseph Lee says the study’s focus was on how to reduce harm from overprescription of antibiotics (though he adds that further research on honey versus placebos is needed, and it is certainly not a “cure-all”).A desire to reconnect with the natural world is driving an increased interest in beekeeping, says Rowberry, who has been “amazed” by the rise in BBA membership – from 23,400 in January last year to 28,300 today.The upward trend predates Covid-19 but in lockdown, she says, many have had more time to start a hobby, with online apiary courses booming. On TikTok, beekeeping videos have been viewed 220m times.Rowberry says many amateur apiarists are motivated by fascination with bees, not their harvest: “There is huge value in sitting quietly and watching the bees go about their business … The honey is just a bonus.”Paul Hekimian, the director of the nonprofit HoneyLove – who has helped actors Aaron Paul, Sophia Bush, Jennifer Garner and other celebrities to maintain their hives – told the Hollywood Reporter that inquiries have surged since the pandemic. Other famous bee enthusiasts are said to include the actors Morgan Freeman, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L Jackson.Ed Sheeran reportedly installed hives on his Suffolk estate during lockdown, while David Beckham posted video to Instagram of him building his own from a kit – and his family, wearing bee suits, with the result.In April the actor Chris Hemsworth shared a clip of his children checking out a Flow hive, an Australian-made structure that produces honey “on tap” – controversial among beekeepers for oversimplifying a complex and time-intensive pastime.As Hooper warns, of the social media-friendly hobby: “It’s not just get your bees and go on Instagram … You’re only going to help them if you do it properly.” Her interest was sparked by a newspaper article 13 years ago now, Hooper says, “bees are my life.”For those prepared to take the time to learn, it is rewarding and absorbing. “When you’re in a heavy cotton bee suit, it’s hot and sweaty, and not particularly glamorous – but I’m totally engrossed in what I’m doing.”Rowberry is in fact looking to reduce her number of hives so that she has more time to enjoy them. “They’re a fantastic society to watch – there’s so much to learn from them,” she says. For instance, the queen may be the most important bee in the hive, but the workers are in control.“If she doesn’t come up to scratch, they will oust her,” says Rowberry with a twinkle. “Maybe that’s what we could learn: people running the country should only be there when they’re positively useful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff516248250637f907b63f6d1ec4ceb161cc5d63/0_134_2097_1259/master/2097.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03913d59ca2bea54d5c518a859e6b6f2","title":"human consumption of the earths resources declined in 2020","story":"The rate at which humanity is consuming the Earth’s resources declined sharply this year as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to researchers.Consequently, Earth Overshoot Day, the point at which human consumption exceeds the amount nature can regenerate in a year, has moved back by over three weeks from 29 July in 2019 to 22 August this year.“Earth Overshoot Day is a way to illustrate the scale of the biological challenge we face,” said Mathis Wackernagel, president of Global Footprint Network. Although Wackernagel said this year’s data was encouraging, he called for further progress to be made “by design not by disaster”.The three week shift between the dates of Earth Overshoot Day in 2019 and 2020 represents the greatest ever single-year shift since global overshoot began in the 1970s. Since then, rising populations and increasing levels of per capita consumption have seen Earth Overshoot Day move earlier into the year, with the date arriving in July for the first time in 2019.“It’s a Ponzi scheme, we’re using up the future to pay for the present,” said Wackernagel. “Most countries have pretty strict laws about businesses running Ponzi schemes but somehow in the ecological domain we think it’s okay. We’ve only got one planet and that’s not going to change. We’ve got a very simple choice, one-planet prosperity or one-planet misery.”Previous economic crises have seen the date pushed back temporarily, such as the 2007-08 financial crisis which saw the date retreat five days further into the year. David Lin, who leads the research team behind Earth Overshoot Day, explained: “This year it was particularly tricky because we wanted to give an indication of how Covid-19 affected 2020 results”.Mike Childs, head of policy for Friends of the Earth, warned that “this year’s improvement in the way we use our natural resources is solely down to Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Unless there is a significant change in the way we act the situation is likely to return to normal, or worse, in the following years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1b5b637ae571bc5c245850c165e1298dcce84f0/0_1009_5252_3151/master/5252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88b3afc6894846ffc225488b440fc34b","title":"greenland melting ice sheet in pictures","story":"New research has found Greenland lost more than a million tonnes of ice every minute in 2019, a trend which could result in a catastrophic sea level rise"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d291a14eb4cb04550b8355337b0d86ed3a84723d/100_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31eef4c6a50e4e54bc4d2a4f0603abc1","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos including rescued pangolins and hyacinth macaws"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48a8d53e53c80331d8604dab89b741068307e6e0/0_64_2945_1766/master/2945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7352a7439bae8e303f50e3b83d360e5","title":"cbd cannabidiols are they the elusive hangover free drinks","story":"Cannabidiols (CBDs), the non-psychoactive element of cannabis, are legal and widely sold in drinks. Do they work, could they replace alcohol – and are they even drinkable? We test five candidates ...Walk past almost any chemist these days, and you’ll see a windowful of CBD-based products, and demand for the stuff is now so great – particularly over the last stressful few months – that it has migrated into drinks as disparate as as soft drinks, tea and gin. And it’s legal.CBD (short for cannabidiol) is the non-psychoactive component of cannabis, and is claimed to have significant health benefits, including pain relief and the reduction of stress and anxiety. The labelling often features words such as “calm”, “harmony” and “balance”, although some brand names, such as Trip and Colorado High, suggest something altogether more stimulating.So do CBD drinks contain enough to have a therapeutic effect? Possibly, if you drink more than one of them, or supplement them with a shot, drops or a cream. The Food Standards Agency recommends a maximum 70mg a day, but regular users I’ve spoken to consumed more like 100-200mg, which is quite impressive when many drinks contain as little as 10mg a serving. Like alcohol and caffeine, the effect can differ from one person to the next, and the only product that had a marked effect on me was Kannaswiss’s C3 shot (£35 for a pack of seven), which was packed with other ingredients and really did leave me feeling unusually sharp and focused.Taste is another issue. The basic taste of hemp is quite earthy and vegetal, which isn’t the biggest draw, so many new brands, such as Trip, Intune and Gibson’s Goodology, are understandably focusing on flavour. As you can see from today’s panel (below), these products don’t come cheap, even though CBD-based drinks are not currently taxed like alcoholic ones. And if one of the reasons you’re feeling stressed is financial, spending £10 a day on CBD drinks and shots isn’t going to work.That said, the demand is certainly out there. When Silent Pool put its Colorado High Gin online six weeks ago, it sold 800 bottles in two days, despite the £50 price tag, while Hatter’s became Holland \u0026amp Barrett’s fastest-selling tea earlier this year, shifting more than 25,000 boxes in the first month. Supermarkets have yet to come on board, but CBD drinks are already on sale in such respectable emporia as Fortnum \u0026amp Mason, Selfridges and Harvey Nichols.The great commercial opportunity, of course, is that CBD drinks can be piggybacked on to the equally buoyant alcohol-free market. An adult soft drink that makes you feel good without giving you a hangover, and that’s the holy grail.Gibson’s Goodology Jasmine Tea and Rhubarb £4.95 a 250ml can, Hic! (or £14.85 for 3). Developed by one of London’s leading mixologists, Hide’s Oskar Kinberg, this tea-based drink has the highest level of CBD per serve (25mg a can), and also the best, most natural fruit flavours of any of the drinks I tried.

When we had meat, it was eaten sparingly and always accompanied with three times more vegetables. This had less to do with being frugal and more to do with my mother’s traditional diet – but when we did have it, it was always so flavourful and tender.This, I learned, was not common. The meat eaten in the homes of my non-ethnic counterparts was often chewy, bland and cooked to death in large portions. It was truly disconcerting, so I mostly just ate the buttery mashed potatoes which were a delightful revelation.How I learned to love those mashed potatoes. I even asked my mother if she could please make them for me, at which she raised a quizzical eyebrow.The engulfing difference between two seemingly similar foods was in the flavour, moistness and texture. When I saw my mother marinate pork at her restaurant I soon realised it all had to do with technique.I took it for granted that everyone tenderised their meat before cooking it – with either pineapple, papaya or onions. But not so.These days I spend a lot of time thinking about the provenance of my meat. But back then thought-provoking questions around food – like sustainably sourcing produce – had yet to be contemplated. Mum was more occupied with the business of survival. Besides, the meat tasted so good – which is possibly why it never occurred to me to wonder where it came from. Just so long as she kept cooking it.My cooking is very much informed by my mother and the ThaiChinese cuisine hacks I learned at her knee. Pork marinaded in pineapple, seasoning and spices for the best grilled skewers papaya to tenderise the toughest cuts a pinch of palm sugar or honey with other seasonings to marinate cuts of thinly sliced meat for a quick stir fry. These leave the meat so yielding and delicious it hardly matters what cut you use.Having a little of this knowledge will transform your home cooking game tremendously. It requires a little forethought but the results are truly worth the effort.Do you wonder why when you see a marinade recipe it often calls for buttermilk or cultured dairy? Pineapple? Miso? Papaya? Kiwifruit, ginger, koji or honey, or even grapes by way of wine?All these contain the digestive enzymes protease, lipase and amylase which help break down protein, fats and carbohydrates – which incidentally make the food easier to chew.I’m throwing a theory out there based on my own cultural diet: I’ve often wondered why so much of food I ate growing up was so texturally malleable. Maybe our ancestors ate like this because it was easier on the gut to process, thus making it possible to get on with the day without needing a lie down every time they ate meat. There are a few differing thoughts on the best way to tenderise meat. One: beat the heck of it with a mallet a la scallopine or Asian meatballs. Watch the episode of Netflix’s Flavour Origins on meatballs and I dare you not want to pound something with a mallet afterwards. Once the meat is tender, you can shock it in an ice bath to give the meatball a bouncy texture. This breaks down the protein entirely but will result in meat that is structurally very thin.Another contender is marinading meat with a solution of water and baking powder which has a faster turnaround time but does not contribute to the flavour.I am slightly biased when it comes to marinating. I like to use whole natural foods, seasoning and tenderising at the same time.Next time you marinate try this:1kg of porkbeeflambgoat, if cut into stir fry pieces marinate for no more than overnight and a minimum for two hours2 tbsp Megachef oyster sauce1 tbsp mirin1 tbsp palm sugar or raw honey50g pineapple, cut into chunks and squished with your clean hands to extract as much juice as you can. You can also use slices of ripe, raw papaya.1 beaten egg1 tbsp premium fish sauce1 coriander root, pounded or beaten with the flat of a large knife10g ginger, pounded or beaten with the flat of a large knife1 tsp ground white pepperMake a marinade by mixing the ingredients together, incorporating well. Immerse meat in a glass container. Sit for no longer than overnight.When you come to cook, separate out the bits from the meat and cook. Do not use the marinade to season the dish as it will contain meat juices which will need to be cooked to boiling point for food safety.It’s best to season the dish with fresh ingredients once it is cooked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11f5aafa6bd204b527b55afea199df5ecca9ca0b/0_123_2860_1716/master/2860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eb4b3cea768657f6cd532c223a3f2e3","title":"atletico madrid barcelona womens champions league quarter final match report","story":"Barcelona will play Wolfsburg in the last four of the Champions League, though this quarter-final was nothing like the one-sided rout in San Sebastian. The hot favourites were kept waiting until the 80th minute for the single goal that sealed victory, Kheira Hamraoui finding the net from close range to finally see off a determined challenge from the patched-up underdogs.This should have been a mismatch. Barcelona won the Spanish league, have not lost a game since being beaten by Lyon in last season’s Champions League final, and have not been troubled by Atlético in three earlier meetings during this campaign. Their opponents found themselves severely compromised by Covid-19 – five players had to withdraw after testing positive – as well as injuries and player departures, yet Atlético showed all their determination and spirit in keeping the game tight for well over an hour.As expected, Barcelona played with an attacking front four, though not even the power of numbers could find a way through a solid Atléti defence. The numerical disparity was even more marked on the bench, where Barca named their full complement of 12 substitutes, while the hosts could only stretch to half a dozen. Atlético had considered forfeiting this game because they did not believe they would be able to raise a team, but even with a handful of debutants pressed into action they managed to give a good account of themselves.Barcelona had the best chance of breaking the first-half deadlock, when Asisat Oshoala chased down a half-cleared corner and Lieke Martens stabbed a shot goalwards, only to find Aïssatou Tounkara in position to clear off the line. The Spanish champions had the upper hand before the interval but were unable to convert their possession into clear-cut chances.Toni Duggan and Angelo Sosa, by contrast, were feeding off scraps playing up front for Atlético, yet in addition to frustrating the Barcelona attack the underdogs did create a couple of opportunities, with Kylie Strom narrowly failing to convert a difficult chance that reached her at the far post, and Sosa shooting too high with teammates waiting for a cross.Oshoala managed to escape Tounkara to reach a couple of crosses early in the second half, without managing to get any power or direction into her headers. More worrying for Barca was what happened when Oshoala finally got in behind Tounkara with the ball at her feet. While Hedvig Lindahl was quickly off her line it was still a chance the Nigerian striker would normally bury, yet she snatched at the shot and put the ball wide of the target. Caroline Hansen did no better with Barcelona’s next chance, hammering a shot at Lindahl with Oshoala an unused option in the middle. As the game entered the final quarter of normal time Barcelona looked the more likely to score but their finishing was still indecisive.The winning goal, when it came, was a tad scruffy, but Barcelona were not complaining. In what turned out to be her last action of the game, Oshoala showed her frustration by attempting an overhead kick near the penalty spot when Hansen crossed from the right. She was unable to make a clean connection, though she did succeed in sending the ball towards Hamraoui, who just needed to keep her composure to slide a low shot into the bottom-left corner. The same player could have added a second before the end – this time Lindahl was equal to her effort – though a two-goal margin would have flattered Barceona and been unnecessarily cruel on the losers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df5adbfe98e31582ec00ae4719c91bc7c9e31122/0_117_3514_2109/master/3514.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9157e548197fbfffb7db5be10a505627","title":"my sister doesnt want to see me should i give up","story":"Your mother caused this rift, says Annalisa Barbieri. But if your sister really doesn’t want to be in contact, you should listenMy childhood was not a happy one. My mother was a narcissistic and toxic person who liked everyone but my older sister, my father and me. She was beautiful, smart and the life of the party. Everyone adored her. But, at home, my sister and I parented her. My father didn’t orce her because of us (the subject was raised several times and we begged for it not to happen). He was 52 when I was born and died when I was 20 I’ve missed him ever since.My mother died a couple of years ago, aged almost 100. I was the only one taking care of her, emotionally and financially, for the last 11 years of her life. She was difficult till the end. After years of therapy, I came to terms with the way she behaved (I’ve forgiven her, but not forgotten), and was there when she passed away, giving her comfort. I am happy that she didn’t break me the way she did my sister.I am happily married with children, and have given them what I never had as a child: namely, love. My sister lived with my mother for more than 30 years she has never married and doesn’t have children. When I returned to Europe after 30 years abroad, she announced that I had to be responsible for our mother. That was the last time I saw her. She says she doesn’t want to see me again because I remind her of our mother. Therapy helped me realise that my sister bore the brunt of my mother’s behaviour. I feel a lot of love for my sister, and was devastated by her rejection, but hoped that, after the death of our mother (who loved to see us apart), we would reunite. It hasn’t happened and now I know it never will. I have written to her several times, to no avail. Should I give up?I wonder if your sister felt rejected, or even abandoned, by you when you went abroad. I don’t know the circumstances – maybe your sister wanted to stay with your mum or maybe she felt she had no choice. But moving continent was quite a statement to make, although I can see why you did it.What happened in those intervening 30 years? Did you visit? Did you stay in touch with your sister? When did you realise your sister had been “broken” by your mum? It seems to me that you’ve done some work (therapy) and realised a few things, and a part of you seems to think your sister should be on the same page. Unfortunately, she doesn’t seem to be.Family therapist and sibling specialist Sharon Bond also wanted you to think about what “giving up” means to you. What would it look like, and how would you do it?Many people write to me wanting to sever ties with family members (or to stop trying to re-establish contact, as in your case). But it’s rarely that simple, because situations and feelings change in ways that you can’t predict. So breaking contact isn’t usually as finite as people would wish. “How would your sister know you’re giving up?” Bond asked. And I would also ask: is it important to you that she knows?As you seem to align yourself with your father, Bond also wondered if you feel that he didn’t “give up” on his marriage, and if that means you in turn can’t give up on your sister. Perhaps you need to turn it around and ask: why hang on? I wonder if you feel you need to make a big statement (even if it’s just to yourself) in the hope of cleaning up a messy situation. But again I wonder if this would give you what you really want.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

But some landlords described it as “unacceptable” and said they were being left “to foot the bill for government failure”.Renters have been protected during the Covid-19 crisis by a temporary government ban on landlords evicting tenants, announced in March and extended in June. It was due to end on Sunday and courts would have restarted eviction hearings from Monday.The lord chancellor requested the extension of the ban on Thursday and it was approved by the civil procedure rule committee on Friday morning in a meeting that noted the “extremely unusual nature and timing” of the government decision.Landlords in England will also be required to provide tenants with six months’ notice, rather than three currently, until at least the end of March, unless the case involves a serious issue, such as antisocial behaviour or domestic violence. When cases do resume, courts will prioritise the most serious cases involving antisocial behaviour and other crimes, and those where rent has gone unpaid for more than a year and landlords would otherwise face unmanageable debts.The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “I know this year has been challenging and all of us are still living with the effects of Covid-19. That is why today I am announcing a further four-week ban on evictions, meaning no renters will have been evicted for six months. I am also increasing protections for renters: six-month notice periods must be given to tenants, supporting renters over winter.”As states across the world ordered citizens to “stay home” in February, the UN housing rapporteur was unequivocal. “Housing has become a frontline defence against coronavirus,”\u0026nbspsaid Leilani Farha. She called on states to “declare an end to all evictions of anyone, anywhere for any reason until the end of the pandemic.”Four months later, and as parts of the world emerge into the so-called new normal, her successor, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, is\u0026nbspwarning\u0026nbspof an “impending tsunami” of evictions. In the US, a\u0026nbspmajority of states have resumed evictions, leaving as many as 40 million – disproportionately people of colour – vulnerable to homelessness due to rent arrears.Bailiffs are back in business across the channel, too, after\u0026nbspan extension to France’s winter eviction ban\u0026nbspexpired last month. In Paris, the mayor, Anne Hidalgo, has protected social renters by extending the eviction ban on public housing to 31 October – protecting them until next summer by segueing into next winter’s\u0026nbsptrêve hivernale.Some countries are doing more. In Spain, where the leftwing Podemost party are part of a governing coalition,\u0026nbspthe government has introduced an eviction ban\u0026nbspthat will remain in force until six months after the end of the state of emergency. An interest-free micro-loan scheme is open to renters who have lost income due to the pandemic.Strong protections are also in place in Germany, where renting is widespread and\u0026nbsprenters’ unions are well-established and powerful. In March the federal government banned the eviction of tenants who fall behind in rent between April and the end of September, while giving itself the discretion to extend the measure for another six months. Landlords can still take tenants to court to recover lost rent.For millions, though, the situation remains bleak and uncertain. Thousands in poorer countries such as Kenya and Brazil were being thrown out of their homes even as the pandemic raged, Rajagopal reported. He warned that when people are deprived of shelter, they become more vulnerable to COVID-19 “and this heightens the risk of widespread contagion.”“I call upon all States to comply with their human rights obligations and ensure that no one is left in a position of increased vulnerability to Covid-19,” he said.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the “11th-hour U-turn” was necessary. But he described the extension as so brief it “will simply give renters a few more weeks to pack their bags”.“Boris Johnson has been warned for months about the looming evictions crisis, but stuck his head in the sand,” Starmer said. “People living in rented accommodation should not be paying the price for this government’s incompetence.”The move was described by the London Renters Union as “kicking the can down the road”.“We’ve had a series of short-term extensions, and that’s caused enormous misery and stress for renters like me,” said Ghazal Haqani, an organiser with the union. “Because so many of us are in arrears, we have been constantly worried for months that we are about to become totally defenceless against landlords who want to kick us out of our homes. It looks like that could happen all over again in September.”The terms under which the ban will eventually be lifted remain unclear. One source said civil servants and ministers had been considering whether protections could remain in place for people who can show they have fallen behind on their rent because of coronavirus. District councils have said up to half a million people could be at risk, while the housing charity Shelter said by the end of June about 174,000 renters had been warned by their landlords that they were facing eviction. Shelter estimated a quarter of a million renters were in arrears.Doctors, represented by the British Medical Association, also warned of a potential surge in Covid-19 cases if the ban was not extended and homelessness increased, with homeless people more likely to have health conditions that increase their vulnerability.The National Residential Landlords Association attacked the government’s decision.“Landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with significant arrears unrelated to Covid-19, antisocial behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make life miserable for their neighbours and housemates,” said Ben Beadle, the chief executive. “There must now be a plan to support households to pay their bills and to compensate landlords fully for their lost income.”But Alicia Kennedy, the director of the campaign group Generation Rent, said the move was a relief to worried renters, although leaving it so close to the deadline had put people through “untold mental stress”.Generation Rent wants the government to use the coming weeks to develop emergency legislation to restrict the use of section 21 “no fault” evictions, as well as eviction for rent arrears, ready for introduction after parliament returns from summer recess on 1 September.Polly Neate, the chief executive of Shelter, said: “A bullet may have been dodged with this extension, but as soon as parliament returns, it must give judges extra powers to stop renters being evicted because of ‘Covid-arrears’.”Two of England’s biggest private landlords told the  they did not plan mass evictions. Fergus Wilson, who owns hundreds of homes in and around Ashford in Kent, said he was expecting his agents to issue two eviction notices. “One is a poorly organised man and the other downright dishonest,” Wilson said.Andrew Panayi, who runs a business renting out several hundred flats and houses in north London, said: “No eviction notices will be served in the foreseeable future.”The National Housing Federation, which represents social landlords and housing associations, had also said no one would be evicted as a result of financial hardship caused by the coronavirus as long as residents made contact with their landlord to agree a manageable way forward."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f37e51f606ebe7dc66de075ab470ff414822fb/0_137_3579_2148/master/3579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8fac7795af3e501f936f5f0b609a65","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

So it’s frozen.”The downbeat assessments came after two days of talks in Brussels and a private dinner between Barnier and Frost. On Thursday, Frost gave Barnier a fresh draft free-trade agreement in an attempt to break the deadlock. Known as a “consolidated legal text” the document merges existing EU and UK draft texts, in an attempt to speed up an autumn agreement.The British official said they had not expected the text to be discussed this week, but hoped “to inject a spark” in the process. “Really, it’s to make the point that we have been saying that it’s time to move to text-based discussions,” they added.Barnier said the document had been “useful” to understand the UK position, but added that it failed to understand the EU’s red lines on the “level-playing field”, common standards on environment, workers’ rights and state aid to give Britain tariff-free access to the EU single market.Sticking to the EU’s well-established position, Barnier rejected any attempt to fast-forward trade negotiations, ahead of other parts of the talks, such as fishing rights and British hauliers’ rights to deliver goods in the EU.Barnier’s insistence on “parallelism” has long frustrated the British. The EU’s approach “makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress”, said Frost.Frost, who said last week a deal could be reached in September, added there were “significant areas” to resolve. “Even where there is a broad understanding between negotiators, there is a lot of detail to work through. Time is short for both sides.”The EU has said there will be no trade deal without an agreement on fishing, as it insists European boats maintain access to British waters. On the subject, Barnier said: “We have made no progress whatsoever on the issues that matter.”British negotiators share this view, but accuse the EU of failing to understand that the government wants a major change from the status quo. EU member states, which claim centuries-old fishing rights in British waters, want to maintain current access, although Barnier has hinted he is open to compromise.Similarly, the UK negotiators are frustrated by the EU’s wish to bind Britain tightly to European rules on state aid in exchange for a free-trade deal. The EU fears generous subsidies to UK companies could tilt the playing field against EU firms.“Things are focussing down, not necessarily helpfully, on the issues of state aid, subsidy policy and fisheries policy,” said the UK official. “What’s frustrating here is that Michel Barnier said in his press conference just now, ‘Brexit means Brexit’, which is of course correct. They don’t apply that in this area where they want to see us continuing arrangements that are very like those that we’re bound by as members of the EU,” they added.“When the EU realise that that needs to change it will be much easier to make progress.”The two sides also failed to make progress this week on long-standing disagreement over lorry drivers’ rights after Brexit. Barnier expressed surprise about the UK debate about the loss of haulage rights after Brexit, while stressing that any future access would depend on accepting EU standards on hauliers’ working time and other regulations. Citing recent press reports, he said: “We have seen an emotion that surprised me four years after the Brexit vote … the UK has decided itself to lose the benefits of the single market. It was their choice. It was not our choice.”The talks are scheduled to resume on 7 September in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe8e62f4e7da27d243e09993b65f47120c948205/0_187_653_392/master/653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27401e13ce2cb142e629bfb14d0ee1a9","title":"mps call on uk to help whistleblower facing extradition to monaco jonathan taylor dutch firm oil","story":"Jonathan Taylor helped reveal how Dutch firm had paid multimillion-dollar bribes to secure oil industry contractsA cross–party group of MPs is urging the Foreign Office to support a corruption whistleblower who says he is the victim of “political persecution” in Monaco.Margaret Hodge, a former Labour minister, Andrew Mitchell, a former Tory minister, and other politicians are calling on the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to help Jonathan Taylor, a 51-year-old British lawyer who was recently arrested while on holiday in Croatia.He was arrested at the request of the authorities in Monaco. The MPs are pressing the British government to help bring Taylor back to the UK because of the “high-level corruption” he has exposed.Taylor, from Hampshire, has been ordered to remain for weeks in Croatia as he faces extradition to Monaco.Eight years ago Taylor blew the whistle while working for a Dutch multinational firm, SBM Offshore, in Monaco. He helped reveal how the Monaco-based firm had paid large-scale multimillion dollar bribes to secure contracts in the oil industry around the world.His information helped prosecutors in the Netherlands, the US and Brazil to force SBM to pay huge penalties to settle the corruption allegations after admitting its wrongdoing.Three weeks ago, he was arrested at Dubrovnik airport when he arrived there with his wife and three teenage children for a holiday.Croatian legal papers seen by the  show he was arrested at the request of the public prosecutor in Monaco for alleged “briberycorruption” committed in 2013.It is understood that this allegation relates to a complaint from SBM Offshore that Taylor attempted to extort money from the firm when he was negotiating compensation for leaving the company. The firm had alleged that he threatened to inform prosecutors about the corruption unless he was given more money.Taylor denies the allegation, adding that a court in Monaco threw out the extortion claim two years ago. He said he was the victim of “clearly political persecution” by the Monaco authorities in what amounted to “a form of revenge”.A Croatian court has released Taylor on bail but told him to remain in the country while the extradition proceedings are resolved.His case has been taken up by Hodge, Mitchell and other MPs on the all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption and responsible tax. In their letter to Raab on Friday, they called on the UK government to help Taylor who they said was “facing international retaliation”.They wrote: “The public rely on the bravery of whistleblowers but far too often, they suffer from vengeful action by their former employers. To encourage whistleblowers to speak out they must be given the appropriate protection. Failure to do so would make others less willing to come forward to expose serious crimes and so undermine the fight against corruption.”An FCO spokesperson later said: “We are supporting a British man and his family following his arrest and detention in Dubrovnik, and are in contact with the Croatian authorities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b6a113133d80f0f959e27e7164f795c880014e/0_114_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3c290e83bd92378c8c4f5cb50175fab6","title":"colin graves talks up the hundred as he leaves ecb with few regrets cricket","story":"Colin Graves ends five years as chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board with regrets about his occasional use of the word “mediocre” but none regarding the Hundred, insisting its detractors are simply resistant to change.The 72-year-old, vying to become the next chairman of the International Cricket Council, was presented with a signed England shirt by Joe Root on the outfield before his final Test in the job and passes the baton on to Ian Watmore next month.His time in charge of the English game has overseen World Cup victories for the women’s team, in 2017, and the men, last year, as well as the start of a record £1.1bn broadcast deal this summer. Speaking to the broadcast partners Sky and BBC on day one of the third Test, Graves admitted “kicking himself” when he publicly used the word “mediocre” to describe West Indies before a 1-1 draw in 2015, and then again in reference to the T20 Blast in 2016.The Blast comment came when making the case for the new short-form tournament that eventually became the Hundred delayed by 12 months due to Covid-19, he admitted getting the controversial project off the ground was his biggest challenge.“I think people in cricket don’t like change,” he told Sky. “I don’t think they realised we’re trying to attract this new audience – women, children, families – which we never really had coming to cricket. I know that even some countries abroad – India in particular – are looking at the Hundred and have been talking to me about it over the last year.“If we’ve still got Covid-19 next year and the ECB decide to play it behind closed doors the broadcast money will still come in. It would be a challenge but last week the Hundred board was very positive.”The ECB’s group reserves dropped from a peak of £73m in 2016 to £17m in the most recent accounts, with money distributed back to the wider game.

A golden spell of 22 successive points in 14 minutes from 17-10 down allowed Exeter to reinforce their lead at the top of the table, with four tries against the Premiership’s meanest defence.It will be the manner of this victory, as much as the five points, that will delight the Chiefs management. There were periods in the first half when the stricter officiating of the breakdown appeared to be threatening the effectiveness of their multi-phase recycling game and Sale’s physicality and defensive line speed were also a persistent first-half headache.Instead of wilting, however, Chiefs redoubled their efforts and showed the kind of character that distinguishes champions. Despite the presence of heavy-duty international opponents such as Tom Curry and Lood de Jager, there was no holding the revitalised visitors in the second half as their set-piece took an expert grip on the contest and Sale disappeared beneath a welter of penalties, eventually conceding 23 to Exeter’s 14. “We got executed,” said Steve Diamond, the Sharks’ director of rugby. “We couldn’t hold their scrum and their power five metres out.”Even Diamond, however, hailed the Chiefs as currently the dominant force in the land. Luke Cowan-Dickie and Sam Simmonds were again outstanding and the Scotland captain Stuart Hogg added another flying try to his collection. The visitors were sharp with ball in hand from the outset, slicing open the home defence with a magnificent try inside the opening two minutes when Henry Slade’s deft inside pass released a charging Olly Woodburn and the winger put the supporting Sam Simmonds overSale, though, were far from the sluggish bunch beaten at Harlequins last week. Their urgency without the ball was particularly impressive and initially made the Chiefs look slightly hesitant. First a strong-running Manu Tuilagi was allowed to set up a score for the alert Tom Curry before Slade allowed the determined Rob Du Preez to escape his clutches and battle his way over for a second home try.The fly-half converted both and, despite the early loss of the limping ex-Chief Byron McGuigan, Sale were still ahead at the interval. Exeter were faring slightly better on the penalty count but were having less joy in their opponents’ 22. One promising close-range forward drive culminated in a Sale penalty at the crucial moment and Slade was then adjudged to have kicked a penalty to the corner dead with his pack itching for another opportunity to apply their thumbscrew.Fresh energy and more control were required and the Chiefs were back level at 17-17 within eight minutes of the restart. From a tap penalty close to the line the dynamic Cowan-Dickie sucked in the majority of the Sale forwards and the relentlessly committed Jacques Vermeulen showed his South African compatriots the way to the try-line.Even better was to follow with another scything score off first-phase ball, with Joe Simmonds this time the provider to the surging Woodburn who set Hogg free for another confident sprint to the line. A booming penalty from halfway by Joe Simmonds compounded the agony for the Sharks, whose discipline was now starting to fray. Tom Curry was sin-binned for a dangerous hit on Hogg and, with Sale still down to 14 men, Cowan-Dickie smashed over from another close-range tap to secure the bonus point.An airborne Denny Solomona did register a consolation try two minutes from the end but by then the outcome was long since settled on a mild, dry north-west evening. If Exeter can now beat second-placed Bristol Bears at Ashton Gate on Tuesday night they will effectively have a home semi-final sewn up with six games left, allowing them to conserve a fair amount of energy for the run-in. On this evidence, with Johnny Gray settling in seamlessly in the second row and Jack Nowell due back from a hamstring strain for the Bristol encounter, they are regaining ominous momentum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54051c45f32af165d480de2e179f309804265614/0_280_3918_2351/master/3918.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc97f66004ba6dfda6331deeb74b885f","title":"zak crawley england cricket pakistan test match ageas bowl","story":"The 22-year-old England batsman delivered on his huge potential with a coming-of-age innings against PakistanZak Crawley pushes the ball through point for a single. The scoreboard operator at the Rose Bowl clicks another run on to his total. Up in the England dressing room, an analyst logs the run on his laptop, along with its associated metadata: a full-length ball, just outside off-stump, seaming away slightly, played off the front foot, with control. On Sky Sports, a graphics operator adds the run in real time, moving England’s score to 28 for one. Meanwhile on Cricinfo’s live database, Crawley’s innings score and live career average are updated accordingly.These days, cricket can increasingly feel like a game drowning in data. Watch a day’s play on television and you will be beaten into submission by an increasingly elaborate array of graphs and graphics, tables and lists, numbers of significance and numbers of pure irrelevance. Tune into Test Match Special and Andy Zaltzman is cheerily reeling off all the records and milestones that have been ticked off in the last 15 minutes.This is fine. This is normal. Cricket has always been the sort of sport where you can indulge in as much or as little of the number-crunching as you wish. In an often mystifying game, numbers offer the illusion of shape and plot. Some tell entire stories in their own right: 952-6, 501*, 99.94, 19-90.The problem comes when you start to imbue the numbers with a weight and a significance that they are unable to bear. This is particularly true of new or young players in international cricket, for whom the early part of their career can often feel like a mad scramble to identify some pattern in the data. Proposition one: Dom Sibley gets caught down the leg side a lot. Proposition two: Dom Sibley has still only played a handful of Test matches and it’s preposterous to draw those sorts of firm conclusions based on a mere sliver of available evidence. Only one of these really holds any water, and unfortunately for Sibley it’s not the one you can build articles and Third Man analysis segments around.The other main problem arises when you confuse the power to explain with the power to predict. When you confuse evidence with knowledge. When Crawley walked out to bat shortly before 11.30am with England 12 for one, there was nothing in our existing frame of statistical reference to suggest that when he returned to the pavilion that same evening, he would do so with 171 unbeaten runs to his name. His previous highest Test score was 76. He had a first-class batting average of 31, with three centuries in 73 innings. Based on the gloomy overheads, you might have pegged him to a low score. But you wouldn’t have known either way.Crawley is one of those batsmen who dictates situations. Partly this is a function of his height, which drags bowlers off their lengths, narrows their margin for error, minutely shifts the terms of engagement. He pulls and hooks attractively, drives with a big stride, leaves firmly and aggressively. His temperament appears sound for a player of his 22 years. Joe Root describes him as “the youngest 40-year-old he’s ever met”. None of the above is provable, by the way. You can’t justify it with numbers. Which is why, as of 11.24am on Friday morning, Crawley remained all conjecture, all potential, a vessel of hope and promise that needed a big number to give it some heft.Perhaps the most impressive part of his innings was the way he adapted himself to the challenge. He counterattacked against the swing of Shaheen Afridi. Against Mohammad Abbas, he advanced so far out of his crease he was in serious danger of obstructing the field. The early spin of Yasir Shah was driven, driven, driven, and then classically cut for four. Against the pace of Naseem Shah, he stood tall and played the ball at the top of its bounce. As Pakistan tried to tempt him into a false shot, he slowed his pace and left judiciously. As the field went back, he pushed and jabbed for singles. As Pakistan tired in the evening, he cashed in.Those who have seen plenty of Crawley in county cricket have long argued that his talent transcends his numbers. Canterbury is a tough place to open the batting. His breakthrough season in 2018 saw him master some torrid surfaces. Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick both succeeded at Test level despite modest county records. All of this, some will argue, is evidence that Crawley has what it takes to be England’s No 3 for the long term.But in a way, none of this is any more definitive. Anyone pencilling Crawley in for the Gabba or making bold comparisons to Len Hutton or Jonathan Trott is, like everyone else, simply peering into the fog. Cricketing nous and empirical data aren’t a simple binary. Just as talent can’t purely be defined by numbers, you can’t extrapolate a Test career based on a gut feel. As he walked out, Zak Crawley was still an unknown quantity as a Test batsman. All we can really say for certain is that we know a little more about him now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6790b7217a49000d4b6c354c13af873669dd5289/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f5fa0fa278d2f79170da60fd5ca7485b","title":"italians do it better an expert guide to hosting an amalfi inspired dinner party","story":"Giulia Rhodes speaks to some in-the-know Italians about how stunning seafood and verdant produce can add a touch of the Amalfi coast to your next dinner partyFrom authors and actors to designers and directors, the glamorous set has long flocked to Italy’s Amalfi coast. And it’s not hard to see why.A film-set perfect 25-mile ribbon of mountainous coastline, its colourful villages, fragrant lemon groves and deep blue sea form a Unesco world heritage site.And as with all Italian regions, the local food and drink is inextricably tied to the culture which means that even if you can’t actually strut your stuff in Positano, you can cook up a bit of Italian sunshine in your kitchen.Alessandro Savelli is CEO and founder of UK-based Pasta Evangelists, which makes premium fresh pasta and sauces for home cooking – with next day delivery across the UK – in addition to its coveted concession in Harrods, now back open for business following the easing of lockdown restrictions.He learned to make pasta with his grandmother. Step one, he says, is to understand the culture. “I am Italian. I love food. I love pasta. I love cooking. Meals in Italy are when the family comes together to talk and enjoy delicious food. It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year.

In the early days it formed the basis of many a #quarantini – made from whatever we might have left in the cupboard. Since then, the hashtag has clocked up more than 87,000 posts and the term has passed into the popular lexicon. Now, take it a notch higher for the ultimate cocktail moment. With Malfy Gin, you can create the most authentic Italian style aperitivo hour. Try a Malfy Gin Rosa G\u0026ampT by mixing a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with Mediterranean tonic in a copa glass over ice and garnishing with a pink grapefruit wheel. Or, for an added touch of sophistication, mix a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with 50ml prosecco and 50ml San Pellegrino Arraciata Rossa over ice in a wine glass, and garnish with an orange wheel, strawberry slice and sprig of thyme to create a Amalfi Sunset Spritz.Front-room festivalsIf you missed glamping it up at Glasto or living it up at Latitude this summer, there’s nothing to stop you recreating that festival feeling right in your front room. This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out. Pitch your tent in the garden – or indoors if it’s raining – swing open the patio doors, pour yourself a Malfy Gin and tonic, and cue up your festival playlist. Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities. So as the weather warms up, it’s time to cast off your lockdown look and raise a glass of Malfy Gin in style.Locally sourced picnicsWith public transport still only used for essential travel and some of our favourite parks and gardens closed, we’re exploring the green spaces closer to home for a suitable patch of grass on which to spread our blankets.The best-dressed picnic baskets are filled with treats that support local producers, from honey collected by local beekeepers and veg from the farmer’s market, to unique small-batch cheeses and British charcuterie sliced on to artisanal sourdough. Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast. With more food businesses pivoting to offer meal kits designed to be finished off at home for that personal touch, there’s no better time to start enjoying gourmet food delivered to your door (without worrying about it getting cold). For a taste of Italy, Pasta Evangelists offer artisan pasta and sauces via next-day delivery across the UK, which can be whipped up at home in minutes. With dishes inspired by culinary traditions found across Italy, from Venice to Sicily, you can be taken on a foodie journey with all the taste and minimum effort.Growing lupinsSince lockdown began, gardening has shot up in popularity, with garden centres opening some time before other non-essential businesses. From window sills to flower beds, this summer is about attempting to turn green spaces into a riot of colour to rival the rainbows pinned in people’s windows, and the West Country Lupin has been particularly popular. Packed with uplifting colour, lupins are easy to grow and soothing to look at, making them the ideal flower to plant this summer.Virtual destination toursGrounded globetrotters are fulfilling their wanderlust by taking virtual tours of some of the world’s most stunning spots. Choose from tours offering 360-degree views of popular destinations such as Tokyo or Machu Picchu, or watch a live stream from San Diego Zoo or California’s Monterey Bay Aquarium.You can even take a treadmill walk through the Colosseum – made even more authentic by concocting a refreshing gin spritz with Malfy Gin Rosa to take with you on your virtual tour.CottagecoreAnyone not ensconced in a countryside pad with an acre or two of garden attached is currently looking enviously towards the idyllic-looking lockdowns of those who are. As even the most ardent city-dweller wrests with sourdough starters and homemade crumpets, we’re being calmed by a trend that has been dubbed “cottagecore” – an aesthetic oozing with images of perfect-looking pies, vases filled with wildflowers and verdant countryside. Get the look by adding some floral frocks or shirts to your wardrobe.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

They’re called the US Postal Inspection Service and they had authority to arrest Bannon and they did so … Somehow, the deep state launched agents of the US Postal Service to arrest Mr Bannon.”The “deep state” is supposedly a conglomeration of bureaucrats and law enforcement agents which exists to thwart Trump’s agenda. Bannon enthusiastically propagated the theory when he was Trump’s campaign manager in the 2016 election and then a senior adviser in the White House.However, since leaving Trump’s employ he has repeatedly cast doubt on the theory.In Deep State: Trump, the FBI and the Rule of Law by James B Stewart, published last October, Bannon said the “deep state conspiracy theory is for nut cases”, because “America isn’t Turkey or Egypt”.There is a formidable government bureaucracy in the US, he told Stewart, but “there’s nothing ‘deep’ about it. It’s right in your face.”Bannon also described to the journalist Michael Wolff, for his book Siege: Trump Under Fire, advice he gave to a ghostwriter working on Trump’s Enemies: How the Deep State is Undermining the Presidency, a book by Trump aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie.As quoted by Wolff, Bannon said: “You do realise that none of this is true.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5618df491b42efb4645a1ea49464a9e95eb33e6/0_264_5082_3050/master/5082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2dc844fc0a2321fd48b4d8180c1a197","title":"berlin rename mohrenstrasse moor street black philosopher anton wilhelm amo","story":"Campaigners welcome decision after years of protest against ‘Mohrenstraße’ nameBerlin authorities have announced they are to rename  Mohrenstraße (“Moor Street”) in the city’s Mitte district after the country’s first black philosopher, Anton Wilhelm Amo.The decision follows years of protest by postcolonial campaigners, including historians and ethnologists, who had criticised the street name as racist.Campaigners welcomed the decision on Friday, which comes in the wake of a worldwide reassessment of the entrenched legacies of historical racism and colonialism.“Berlin is making history,” said the association Berlin Postkolonial in a statement. “We welcome this decision as an internationally visible signal against racism in the public realm.”The announcement followed a meeting among councillors from Berlin’s Mitte district at which the Greens and Social Democrats voted in favour of the move. They overruled a motion by the leftwing faction proposing the establishment of a naming committee which would have consulted the public over an alternative name.Campaigners are now waiting to see if the city’s public transport authority, BVG, will still press ahead with its controversial decision last month to rename Mohrenstraße on the U2 metro line as Glinkastraße, after the Russian composer, Mikhail Glinka. That name is considered highly problematic because he and many of his works are perceived as antisemitic.Intensive political discussions about renaming the street have gone on for more than 15 years. It was viewed as offensive by many who argued that the name derived from black slaves in Germany in the late 17th century, while others saw it simply as an old-fashioned term not meant to be derogatory.But the recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations gave the row a new impetus. Some protesters renamed the street and metro station George Floyd Street with temporary placards, after the African American man killed during police arrest in May. Others added an “umlaut” or two dots over the “o”, turning it into “Carrots Street”.Opponents of the street name have long since referred to it simply as ‘M-Straße’.The initiative to rename the street Anton Wilhelm Amo came from the association Decolonize Berlin.Amo was brought to Berlin as a child slave from what is now Ghana in 1707 by the Dutch West India Company and had to serve as a so-called Kammer Mohr or “chamber moor” in the Prussian court. He later went on to study in Halle and Jena universities and became Germany’s first black philosopher. He is also believed to have been the first African-born student to attend a European university.Opposition to the renaming came from the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Its MP Martin Trefzer said those in favour of a name change were “sinning against the cultural identity of the city”. Oliver Frederici of the Christian Democrats (CDU) said “we disapprove of the obsession with renaming things”.Mnyaka Sururu Mboro, of Berlin Postkolonial, who has been hosting critical tours on the subject for more than two decades, said: “This is a great day: Berlin is banishing an offensive word from the city, and with Amo is honouring a campaigning scholar from Africa.”Protesters continue to call for the renaming of Onkel Toms Hütte, a metro station in the south-west of the city named after the 1852 novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom’s Cabin, objecting to the racist connotations.

The data suggests that as people mix more freely, there are probably increases in community transmission.“This is to be expected, but highlights the problems in coming out of lockdown, particularly when there are many thousands of active cases in a population,” he said, adding that difficulties in controlling the virus could be aggravated with the onset of winter because fewer people will be willing to meet outdoors.The north-west, London and the south-west could all have R values above 1.0, but the team said the estimates for the latter two regions were not robust because of factors such as low case numbers or a high degree of variability in transmission across the region.Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, an expert in mathematical modelling at University College London, cautioned that when infection levels fall, there is high variability in transmission across the country and disease is spread down to localised clusters, R becomes a less useful figure.Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said local outbreaks were the most important focus, and that the R figures and growth rate did not show a clear trend. “It could be that the epidemic is growing, but it probably isn’t, it’s probably declining, though not very fast,” he said.Weekly data from the Office for National Statistics suggested that the coronavirus infection rate in England was continuing to level off, with around one in 2,200 iniduals having the virus and about 2,400 new cases a day for the week of 7–13 August, down from around 3,800 new cases a day the week before.“There is not enough evidence to say at this point that there has been a fall in incidence in the most recent week, therefore we continue to report that the incidence rate for England has levelled off,” the team reported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d402bd53605955a4190f202e7cb21517dc435ca/46_260_2993_1796/master/2993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=079841c2410be9c1fd8d73a8df28a731","title":"maltas former pm questioned daphne caruana galizia inquiry joseph muscat","story":"Joseph Muscat formally interviewed for first time in connection with investigationMalta’s former prime minister Joseph Muscat has been questioned by police in connection with the investigation into the murder of the anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.Muscat resigned as leader of the EU member state in January after the widening political scandal surrounding the journalist’s death threatened to bring down his government.The interview on Friday marks the first occasion on which he has been formally questioned by investigators in connection with the case.In a statement released after he left police headquarters in the capital, Valletta, Muscat said officers had “confirmed to me on the record that I am not under investigation in connection with the case, which was concluded under my watch”.The decision to question him was prompted by a statement made by the chief suspect, the business magnate Yorgen Fenech, Muscat confirmed.In June, Muscat denied claims made by Fenech that the two men discussed sensitive details of the case, including the existence of secret recordings made by a middleman, on two occasions while Fenech was under investigation.“I have today answered questions by the police regarding a statement made by Yorgen Fenech with regards to Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination, and which according to the media was given only after Mr Fenech was refused a pardon,” Muscat said. “While I am not at liberty to ulge details, the questions regarded points that are already in the public domain and which I also replied to publicly.”Fenech’s arrest last year led to the resignation of Muscat’s chief of staff and two of his ministers, and ultimately to the prime minister’s decision to leave government.Malta\u0027s best-known investigative journalist was killed in a car bomb as she left her home in October 2017.\u0026nbspThree men in their fifties arrested in December 2017 and then formally charged in July 2019 with Caruana Galizia’s murder, criminal conspiracy and the criminal use of explosives.A taxi driver from Birkirkara and suspected middleman in the Caruana Galizia case, he was arrested on 14 November 2019 in a separate money laundering case. He has offered to provide information he says he has on the journalist\u0027s death in exchange for a pardon.A prominent businessman arrested onboard his yacht as a person of interest in the Caruana Galizia investigation\u0026nbspon 20 November 2019. One of the journalist\u0027s final investigations was a leak of data from his businesses. He has previously denied any wrongdoing. On 28 November his lawyers deposited a letter in court to Malta’s president formally asking for a pardon in return for information relating to the case. On 29 November the request was turned down.The Maltese PM\u0027s chief of staff and the tourism minister resigned on 25 and 26 November 2019 respectively. Caruana Galizia reported that they had taken control of secretive Panama shell companies soon after entering office. They deny any wrongdoing. Schembri was arrested on 26 November and released on 28 November. Police said that after an \u0027intensive investigation\u0027 they no longer felt the need to hold him.Malta’s prime minister since 2013, he has been criticised by opposition politicians for allowing Schembri and Mizzi to stay in their posts. Having said on 29 November that he would stay in the job until the investigation into the murder\u0026nbspwas complete, on 1 December in a televised address he announced that he would stay on until a new leader of his ruling Labour party was elected in January. The prime minister expressed “deep regret” for Caruana Galizia’s murder and spoke of the need for a “fresh page”.The businessman, whose interests range from hotels to casinos and a government-sponsored power project, has pleaded not guilty to charges of complicity to murder Caruana Galizia. He has also denied allegations that he conspired to bribe members of Muscat’s cabinet. Those named in connection with the allegations deny all wrongdoing.Muscat led his Labour party to a landslide victory in 2013 after two decades in opposition. His term in office was marked by both economic expansion and political scandal. The country’s property and financial services markets boomed thanks to a lucrative “golden passports” scheme – now being wound down – which allowed wealthy investors from Russia, China and the middle east to buy Maltese citizenship and easy access to the EU.The Labour leader was returned to power in June 2017 despite Caruana Galizia’s revelations that his energy minister and his chief of staff had acquired secretive shell companies soon after entering office. The journalist was assassinated in a car bombing near her home a few months later, in October 2017.Three men accused of planting the bomb were arrested shortly afterwards. Police suspected Fenech’s involvement in the case as early as 2018, when Muscat signed a warrant ordering the tapping of his phone. However, investigators did not move against the alleged mastermind until late 2019, when he was arrested at sea while sailing away from Malta on board his yacht."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aea759176d9d5a0c186726fd4771b28f206337d8/0_190_4942_2965/master/4942.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b0f827c05188fde0220e52c9dc0eca8","title":"uk cheap food could fuel covid 19 spread says who envoy","story":"Exclusive: Cramped work and home conditions may be behind infections in factories, says expertBritain’s demand for cheap food could be fuelling the spread of the coronavirus in factories, a leading health expert has warned, as analysis shows nearly 1,500 cases across the UK.Cramped conditions in some factories and in low-paid workers’ homes, spurred by the UK’s desire for cheaply produced food, may have driven infection rates in the sector, according to David Nabarro, a World Health Organization special envoy on Covid-19.In the early stages of the pandemic, the UK avoided the scale of Covid-19 outbreaks seen in meat factories and other food processing plants in countries such as the US. But a  analysis suggests that reported UK outbreaks of the disease are now increasing in frequency, with examples of cases spreading into the wider community.While there is no suggestion of breaking social distancing rules, factories by their nature involve large numbers of workers under one roof.Unions say most of those working in UK meat, poultry and other mass food production plants are foreign migrant workers who share accommodation and transport. Nabarro, speaking in his capacity as a professor at University College London’s Institute for Global Health, raised the issue of low pay, which may mean employees exposed to the virus feel pressured to keep working. A culture of cheap food was based on driving production costs down – but at a price, he said.“It may well be that in keeping production costs down, we end up with a situation where the people who work in food processing are under very, very tough working conditions and are paid relatively small amounts of money compared with other roles.“So one could argue that this is not so much structural issues in society as a consequence of the perpetual pressure to get quality of food up and prices down. And so a part of this may require thinking carefully about how much to pay for particular kinds of food.”Nabarro said working and living conditions for food factory staff could create a perfect storm for the spread of the coronavirus. “If people are living in very high-occupancy, cramped conditions and they’re sharing transport, that obviously is another way in which transmission is likely.“So, if you add it together, the conditions inside the plants seem to contribute to the spread. The conditions of living and travel seem to contribute to spread. And the way in which money is handled if you’ve got to isolate may also contribute to spread.“So, the hypothesis that I have developed is that, in these cold plants where work is very intense, there are quite a lot of factors that come together that make infection with the virus more likely.”His comments may be seen to echo criticism of fast fashion for driving a culture of cheap clothing.Figures compiled by the  suggest at least 1,454 cases linked to food factories across England, Scotland and Wales.Northern Ireland, whose authorities do not publish specific statistics on the number of workers in the region’s large food processing sector, made food plants secondary only to healthcare when it was considering priorities for its contact-tracing app.In June, Boris Johnson acknowledged the problem in food processing plants, telling the Commons that ministers were investigating, but neither the government nor health officials were able to produce data looking specifically at it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90f525bebfe5fad384516dc0c6180deb6f02d954/0_63_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f8388e53127b1c8529456c645664380","title":"us hurricanes simultaneous tropical storm laura","story":"Tropical Storm Laura currently lies at other end of Caribbean to a separate tropical depressionA tropical storm and a tropical depression at opposite ends of the Caribbean were projected to possibly become hurricanes, major storms which could hit the US simultaneously after drenching much of the region.The US mainland has not been hit by two tropical storms simultaneously since September 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression. Then, a category 3 hurricane hit Brownsville, Texas, while a tropical storm came ashore at Cedar Key, Florida.On Friday morning, Tropical Depression 13 became Tropical Storm Laura as it neared the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico as a disorganized storm with an uncertain future. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it might degenerate, or might blow up into a major hurricane headed for Florida and the Gulf coast.The current forecast track, highly uncertain, would carry Laura just north of Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba, across the Bahamas and then to southern Florida by Monday or Tuesday and the Gulf coast.On Friday morning, it was centered about 255 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands and was heading west-northwest at 21mph. It had maximum sustained winds of 35mph.Tropical Depression 14, meanwhile, was nearing the coast of Honduras. The NHC said it was expected to veer north-west and cut across Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula on Sunday, possibly at or near hurricane force. A hurricane watch was in effect for the strip of coast containing Tulum, Playa del Carmen and Cancún, as well as Cozumel island.From there, the long-term forecast track would carry it to the US Gulf coast, perhaps Texas or Louisiana, by Tuesday or Wednesday – again, possibly, as a hurricane. En route, it is likely to soak flood-prone eastern Honduras, the Cayman Islands and parts of the Yucatán.On Friday morning, it was centered about 160 miles east of the Honduran resort island of Roatán with 35mph winds. It was headed west-north-west at 12 mph.In the Pacific, former category 4 Hurricane Genevieve was weakening and heading further out to sea after a glancing blow to the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, where it caused at least two deaths and knocked out power to a large part of the Los Cabos area.The NHC said Genevieve, now a tropical source, had maximum sustained winds of 45mph and was centered about 145 miles west of Cabo San Lázaro, Mexico. It was heading west-northwest at 9mph."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336128.1598048144!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kildare lockdown we just want to be married and get on with our lives","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDeclan Flynn and Lorna O’Driscoll whose Kildare wedding has been put off for a second time due to Covid-19 restrictions. Photograph: Lorna O’Driscoll. On Friday morning Lorna O’Driscoll and Declan Flynn nervously awaited news on whether Kildare would be released from lockdown. For them the implications were huge - could they get married or not?“This is our second go at it,” Declan explained, hours before the news came down that the county would remain under tighter restrictions for a further two weeks.The Dublin couple, who met four years ago, were due to be married next Thursday. Now everything is up in the air again - the wedding, the honeymoon, the costs. Theirs is just one of many stories of how lockdown disrupts life.“At this stage we have planned and re-planned so many times,” said Lorna. “We don’t know if we need to plan another wedding again. We just don’t know what to do.“I thought I would be worried about silly things like the weather and my hair and now we are worried about, can we get married.”In April, they rescheduled for a smaller service at the end of August and began to look forward to it again. Friends and cousins, removed from the guest list in order to stick to social distancing requirements, understood. Aunts and uncles graciously volunteered to drop out.There is also the unknown financial implications of a possible third attempt - the couple simply do not know what costs they are facing. Earlier this year they cancelled their honeymoon in Greece and now its replacement, a week in Kerry, is also uncertain. Their wedding bands each have the wrong date engraved.Currently refurbishing their first home, they know others who have postponed their nuptials but it is not a course they want to take. But with the extended lockdown announced on Friday, the one certainty is that their planned wedding will not proceed, again.“We just want to be married and get on with our lives,” says Lorna, “to do all of the things that you are supposed to get to do.”‘Fuming’Simon Mooney, general manager of the Moyvalley Hotel \u0026amp Golf Resort on the Balyna Estate where next week’s wedding was supposed to take place says he has had 45 postponements and five cancellations so far this year. His turnover will be cut by at least 70 per cent.“It’s more than a bit of a blow, it’s absolutely devastating. We are fuming,” he said of the ongoing localised restrictions.“We are absolutely disgusted and even more angry now considering the scandal with golfgate which is just a kick in the teeth.”He was, of course, referring to the controversial Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in Galway, the fallout from which consumed the Government on Friday. For many in Kildare, it raised further frustration as to why they should put up with more pain from Covid-19 restrictions.“That event not only should not have taken place,” he said.StigmaLike other hotels, the Moyvalley had stuck rigidly to national guidelines ahead of the three county lockdown, even at the cost of turning away business.“Kildare’s reputation has been completely targeted here, completely affected,” he said. “It’s ruined for the foreseeable future...who wants to stay in Kildare at the moment? There is a total stigma.”It is a sentiment shared by Mary Supple, owner of the Finesse Weddings shop in Rathangan who says people lose interest when they hear they are Kildare based. A planner and decor provider, she has moved 130 weddings into 2021 and 2022.“The diary list filtered out within a matter of weeks,” she said. “We have a small amount of weddings hanging in for the rest of the year. The uncertainty is a big thing for couples.“I don’t blame them postponing until next year, how can you make a plan?”The renewed restrictions mean the content of her showroom - flowers, linens, table centrepieces - will remains behind closed doors, unavailable for inspection by potential clients.As for the Galway controversy: “I was angry...it makes a mockery of Irish people who have stayed at home and adhered to the guidelines.”Sorcha O’Neill, a Kildare-based civil celebrant for the last four years, has also seen many weddings rescheduled.“Most of my bookings that have tried to push out for later in this year have gone to 2022 because it’s impossible to find anything,” she said.“They are praying that they can get something in the same venue. Usually the venue means something to the clients.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Activist says ongoing denial about scale of crisis contrasts with urgency of Covid fightEvaluation suggests using ecosystem thresholds to develop policies is not best approach\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study finds"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 target"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThere have been a further 79 cases of coronavirus confirmed in the State, it was confirmed on Friday evening. No new deaths were reported.There have now been a total of 1,776 Covid-19 related deaths here along with 27,755 confirmed cases of the virus.Of the latest cases notified 73 per cent are under 45 years of age.Some 30 are confirmed to be associated with outbreaks or are close contacts of a confirmed case while 21 cases have been identified as community transmission.In terms of where the new cases are located 43 are in Dublin, nine are in Kildare, six in Cork, six in Tipperary and the remaining 15 cases are in Clare, Donegal, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Mayo, Roscommon, Wexford and Wicklow. Earlier the Government announced a new package of financial measures to businesses in Kildare after agreeing to extend the lockdown in the county by two weeks due to the high number of Covid-19 cases.The lockdowns of neighbouring Laois and Offaly has been lifted, while the restrictions will remain for Kildare based on the advice of the State’s National Public Health Emergency Team.The local restrictions in Kildare “are working but they need more time,” Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said as the Government extended the county’s lockdown.He said schools would reopen in Kildare as planned, despite the extension of restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of infections from food plant outbreaks.He said that the number of new Covid-19 cases in Laois and Offaly has fallen in the past week and while new cases in Kildare have stabilised, the number of infections “is still high” and the number of new daily cases, at 40, is about twice as high as it was two weeks ago. The State’s acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said he was hopeful that the number of cases in Kildare would begin to decline but that the county needed “a little bit more time now to turn the corner” and reduce cases in line with other counties.“I would be cautiously optimistic that we are going in the right direction,” he said. Mr Donnelly told a press briefing at Government Buildings that the total number of cases per 100,000 people stood at almost 200 in Kildare compared with a national figure of 27.Dr Glynn said Kildare accounted for one third of all cases in the country last week.The minister said the people of Kildare, Laois and Offaly has shown the country that “targeted measures can suppress this virus” and how to “avoid more aggressive restrictions.”“I know this is difficult news for families, businesses and communities across Kildare but make absolutely no mistake: your efforts are working, your efforts are saving lives and your efforts are preventing the sort of measures being needed that we all lived through earlier this year,” he said.Dr Glynn said that a high number of new cases continued to be reported daily in Kildare with infections widely distributed across the county. The seven- and 14-day incidence rates have been at “several multiples of the national average,” he said.There was “cause of cautious optimism” in Kildare given that the rate of unexplained community transmission was not out of line with national levels and that the numbers being treated in hospitals and critical care units remained low, he said.“This indicates that measures appear to be working but due to the overall volume of active cases, more time is required to reduce the number of cases in Kildare,” he said.Mr Donnelly said he was “very aware” of the anxiety of parents with schools reopening but that a “huge amount of work” has been done to prepare for a safe reopening.Dr Glynn said that international evidence is that children do not commonly transmit the virus to each other or to adults in schools and that schools do not drive community transmission.He said that four key workplace clusters in the county and a number of clusters in direct provision centres “do seem to be largely brought under control” but the measures were being extended in Kildare to stop the virus spreading more widely into people’s homes.Asked whether he was worried that the public anger over the flouting of Covid-19 guidelines by Oireachtas members at a golf society dinner in Cliften would undermine requests to adhere to public health advice, Dr Glynn said: “Perhaps I am naive but I am not concerned.” “Public buy-in” had been at the heart of the public response and he felt there was an understanding of the importance that people had to protect themsleves and their families, he said.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar said earlier that further assistance would be provided to Kildare businesses following the decision to extend restrictions.“I realise how disappointing today’s news will be for the people of Kildare. It has been a devastating few months for business owners, their staff and families,” he said.“By extending these restrictions now, we will avoid further, more damaging measures later on. We must do everything we can to protect people. The people of Kildare are making a sacrifice on behalf of the entire country. I recognise that and we are redoubling our efforts to help businesses.”The local lockdowns of the three counties, introduced two weeks ago in response to a surge in Covid-19 cases linked to outbreaks in meat processing plants and food companies, were the first regional restrictions to be introduced by the Government during the five-month pandemic.Infections have remained high in Kildare during the two-week lockdown of the counties.Dr Ronan Glynn, the State’s acting chief medical officer, said on Thursday night there had been 455 Covid-19 cases in Kildare over the past 14 days compared with 81 in Offaly and 41 in Laois.Following the decision of Cabinet to lift restrictions for Laois and Offaly and to extend the lockdown for Kildare, Mr Varadkar announced the additional supports for businesses.The supports include large financial grants, greater assistance from the local enterprise office in Kildare, additional marketing grants and prioritised applications from Kildare for all schemes.“I’m particularly concerned about small businesses and those in the hospitality sector. I have asked the Local Enterprise Office to make a list of recommendations for further measures that Government can take to help businesses in Kildare to maximise trade over the next two weeks,” said Mr Varadkar.He said that the Government “will do everything we can to help.”It comes as another 20 people in Northern Ireland have tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Department of Health, bringing the total in the region to 6,576.No further deaths with Covid-19 have been reported.Figures calculated by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) using information from death certificates, shows the total number of Covid-19-related deaths registered in the region to August 14th was 863. The departmental figures are based on patients having previously tested positive for the virus.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336123.1598046161!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish hotels federation was awaiting clarification on new guidelines at time of golf dinner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Station House Hotel in Clifden where the golf dinner was held said  it “wouldn’t do anything to jeopardise the hotel or the people dining”.The Irish Hotels Federation has said it was awaiting clarification from the Government on updated guidelines for the hosting of functions in hotels announced last Tuesday at the time a controversial dinner was hosted by the Oireachtas Golf Society in a hotel in Connemara on Wednesday.The IHF indicated it believed that the event, which led to the resignation of the Minister for Agriculture, Dara Calleary, complied with Government guidelines under a protocol agreed with the Department of Tourism.In a statement issued on Friday, the IHF said current guidelines around capacity at an indoor event were “clear” and permitted a maximum of 50 people at any one time including hotel staff and other event support workers.Although that condition pertained at the time the event was first organised, stricter guidelines were announced by the government on Tuesday which stated that “no formal or informal events or parties should be organised” in hotels, with the exception of weddings.The Oireachtas Golf Society’s 50th anniversary dinner at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, Co Galway was attended by 81 guests split between two rooms separated by a partition with 45 diners in one room and 36 in the other.The IHF said it had sought clarification on the updated measures announced on Tuesday from Government officials.The organisation said it had advised its members at the time that the “status quo” in terms of operational procedures remained in place until further notice as part of an agreed protocol with the department with responsibility for tourism.“Multiple gatherings are allowed in venue facilities provided they are in separate defined spaces and there are systems to prevent intermingling in common spaces like entrances, exits and toilet facilities,” the IHF said.The IHF said it was the responsibility of inidual hotels to ensure compliance with published operational guidelines.“We encourage all hotels to ensure that they are fully compliant with the operational guidelines,” it added.The federation said it was expecting additional guidance on “urgent points of clarification” next week.It observed that the guidelines which were developed by Fáilte Ireland were “detailed and complex and evolve with changing public health advice”.The IHF said there was an established process that the Department of Tourism circulated guidelines following the announcement of any changes to existing restrictions.The federation did not respond to a series of further questions put to it by The  seeking further comment on its attitude to the use of partitions to circumvent the limit on numbers attending single events.A person staying at the hotel with his family told The  he saw no evidence of social distancing when he witnessed the attendees arriving.“No masks. No distancing,” said the witness who asked that his name not be used.One of the attendees at the Oireachtas Golf Society event, a county councillor, said he had personally asked the hotel’s manager about arrangements and had been informed that the function was in compliance with Government guidelines.“He said they have been reassured by the Irish Hotels Federation that everything was OK,” the councillor said.He added: “If we had a whiff that we were not in compliance with the guidelines, there would have been a rush out the door.”The councillor insisted that only “three to four per cent of the partition” was open between the two rooms, while the only people passing through it were a few recipients of prizes.According to the Station House Hotel, its management liaised with the IHF prior to the event and were advised to ensure that there were no more than 50 in a room at any one time.“We would never try to exceed the guidelines. We wouldn’t do anything to jeopardise the hotel or the people dining. This is not something we take lightly,” it added.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335766.1598015236!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"golf dinner reaction attendees should leave public life says gabriel scally","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Station House Hotel in Clifden – venue for the golfing dinner Politicians and public figures among more than 80 people attending an Oireachtas Golf Society dinner during Covid-19 restrictions “should leave public life and do something else”, a leading public health expert has insisted. Dr Gabriel Scally, president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine in London, said he was shocked and saddened over revelations about the large gathering at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, Co Galway, on Wednesday. Attendees appeared to be taking the attitude “do as we say, not as we do”, he said, adding: “This is absolutely wrong.”Dr Scally said it was not enough for leading political figures to resign and lie low for a while over the affair, with the hope of resuming office again in a few years. “They should leave public life and do something else,” he said. Speaking on RTÉ’s Today with Sarah McInerney show, Dr Scally said the Irish public had made extraordinary sacrifices in the battle to curb the spread of coronavirus and were being let down by those in power. Young people were being singled out by the Government over gatherings that were flouting official restrictions to control the pandemic. “Then they see this group of auld fellas out together,” he said. Dr Scally said a “clear and consistent message” is necessary and the onus is on Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly to urgently develop a clear strategy on cutting the number of new cases to zero. Labour leader Alan Kelly said those who organised and attended the golfing dinner “have let Ireland down in one of the toughest periods in our history”. “This should never even have been contemplated,” he told The . “It was against all the regulations. It was against the previous regulations and the new regulations.”Mr Kelly said EU Commissioner Phil Hogan and Supreme Court Justice Séamus Wolfe – both of whom were in attendance – would need to be having “very strong conversations” on Friday about their role in public life. “I think the standard set by Dara Calleary’s resignation applies across the board. It was a massive misjudgment, it was totally wrong. People saw what was going on there, and, even if they weren’t aware beforehand they should have left.”Mr Hogan’s response, in a tweet, that he had been assured the event complied with Government guidelines was a “laughable excuse”, said Mr Kelly. “He didn’t even offer an apology,” he added, suggesting Mr Martin could express no confidence in the commissioner to the EU if he were not to resign. “If Séamus Wolfe was still the attorney general, I don’t think his position would be tenable either,” said Mr Kelly. “The Chief Justice may very well think the same. I’d be surprised if there isn’t a very strong conversation along those lines today.” The revelations have left the Government’s Covid-19 message in “tatters” while frontline health workers and those driving the public health response to the pandemic have been left “insulted”, the Labour leader said.“It is taking them for granted and it shows a level of arrogance, that the people who attended believe there is a two-tier system in Ireland, where there is one rule for an elite and different rules for everyone else. It’s abhorrent,” said Mr Kelly. It is “very difficult” now for politicians to ask the public to adhere to health guidelines, he added.

Photograph: Frank Miller A dinner following a golf outing has seen the Fianna Fáil deputy leader resign from Cabinet, Ireland’s European commissioner carefully explain his movements since returning from Brussels, and the judgment of a Supreme Court justice called into question. The Garda is also investigating. What is going on? What exactly are the rules now for gatherings in hotels? Under phase three of the so-called roadmap to reopening Ireland, indoor gatherings of more than 50 people have been banned since the end of June.Earlier this week that restriction was further tightened by the Government. On Tuesday, the day before the Oireachtas Golf Society’s dinner, it was announced that indoor gatherings must be capped at six people. The only exceptions are weddings and cultural events, such as plays, concerts and shows, where up to 50 people are allowed to attend if strict distancing and hygiene controls are in place. As for restaurants, including hotel restaurants, a maximum of six people are permitted at a table. However, the Irish Hotels Federation said the pre-existing rules apply until updated “operational guidelines” are published, likely next week. Gardaí are investigating any potential breaches of Covid-19 laws that occurred. Does this mean the Oireachtas Golf Society breached both the old and the new rules?More than 80 people attended the dinner at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, Co Galway, including the then minister for agriculture Dara Calleary, who has resigned from Cabinet over his attendance, and Seanad leas-cathaoirleach Jerry Buttimer, who has stepped down from his position. The table plan for the event, according to the Irish Examiner, listed 82 people for the dinner, with up to 10 at some tables. If you include staff, which the restrictions say should be factored in when calculating maximum numbers, the gathering was attended by many multiples of the latest recommended number permitted and comfortably more than the previous cap of 50.What have those who attended to say for themselves?Former TD and Senator Donie Cassidy, the president of the society, apologised “unreservedly” on its behalf , and said “it was not our intention to disregard Government or health authorities’ advice”. “I have been legally advised not to make any further comment at this time. I confirm that I will fully co-operate with the Garda investigation,” he added.Former RTÉ radio presenter Sean O’Rourke also apologised for attending the dinner. “I don’t have a defence. I was invited to play golf and I really didn’t consider it beyond that, other than to assume whatever was happening would be acceptable from a public health point of view.”Independent TD Noel Grealish, captain of the society, said he was assured the event was in line with the latest public health guidelines, but he now realises attending was an error of judgment. He sincerely and unreservedly apologised, as did a number of Senators and councillors who attended.Mr Calleary apologised to the country, Taoiseach Micheál Martin and the Government for having “undermined” the national effort to combat the spread of Covid-19. Mr Buttimer admitted he had made “a serious lapse of judgment”. Wasn’t someone who works in Brussels there?EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan was in attendance, but insists this is not a resigning matter for him. The former Fine Gael minister said he self-isolated in Co Kildare after returning from Brussels last month and then attended a medical appointment in Dublin before convalescing in Kilkenny for a period and later attending the society’s dinner in Galway. He said he only went to Clifden “on the clear understanding that the organisers and the hotel concerned” had been assured by the Irish Hotels’ Federation that the arrangements in place would comply with the Government guidelines. Mr Hogan on Friday night apologised for any distress his attending the dinner had caused and the EU Commission has stood by him. A spokeswoman said “with hindsight, had he known it would not be in compliance with rules and guidelines established by the Irish authorities, he would not have attended it because it is important for him to act responsibly in matters regarding Covid-19”.And what were those assurances from the Irish Hotels’ Federation?In a statement on Friday the federation said it advised all its members that the “status quo” remained until further notice, allowing a maximum of 50 people at indoor events, including hotel staff and any other event support workers. “Multiple gatherings are allowed in venue facilities provided they are in separate defined spaces and there are systems to prevent intermingling in common spaces (e.g. entrances, exits and toilet facilities),” it said, adding that it was down to “each inidual hotel” to comply with the rules. It is understood that the room was ided into two by a partition during the dinner with fewer than 50 people at either side. Sources say the partition was pulled back for speeches.Was a senior judge there too?Yes. Supreme Court judge Mr Justice Séamus Woulfe was present. He was attorney general earlier in the pandemic when the original restrictions were being drawn up. The judge said he was not aware there was to be a dinner after the game of golf, but on learning about it, it was his understanding “that the organisers and the hotel had satisfied themselves that they would be operating within Government public health guidelines”. He said he would never disregard public health advice, and that “I do apologise for any unintentional breach of any of the new guidelines on my part”.Dr Anthony Staines, professor of health systems at Dublin City University, labelled the actions of attendees as “reckless and dangerous”, and said Mr Woulfe had “serious questions to ask himself” in his role as a senior member of the judiciary."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Decision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335611.1598033102!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"alexei navalny gets go ahead to be evacuated to germany","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlexei Navalny: Fell ill on a flight on Thursday. Photograph:  Mladen AntonovAFP via Getty ImagesAlexei Navalny is set to be airlifted to Germany for specialist medical treatment as Russia’s most prominent critic of the Kremlin remains in a coma after a suspected poisoning.The decision to allow for his evacuation after repeated denials came at the end of a day of intense lobbying by his family and supporters. They argued that remaining in a Siberian hospital was a threat to his life and was being ordered by Russian authorities who did not want the substance that had caused his illness to be discovered.President Vladimir Putin’s best-known critic ending up in hospital after drinking a cup of tea at an airport has underscored the threats against opposition activists in Russia. It has sparked demands by global leaders for a full investigation, following contradictory statements from the doctors treating him.Anatoly Kalinichenko, deputy chief doctor at the hospital in Omsk in southern Siberia where Mr Navalny has been in intensive care since Thursday, told reporters that they had found no traces of toxic substances in his system, and that he was “demonstrating a positive trajectory” and was “quite stable”.“The diagnosis of poisoning will remain at the back of our minds. But we don’t believe the patient was poisoned,” Mr Kalinichenko said.But earlier on Friday, Ivan Zhdanov, head of Mr Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, said a police officer had told him Mr Navalny was poisoned with a substance “that poses a threat not only to him but to those around him” and that those treating the activist were required to wear protective equipment.Appeal to PutinApproval for Mr Navalny to fly to a Berlin hospital on a plane provided by private donors was granted late on Friday, after Mr Navalny’s wife Yulia made a public appeal to Mr Putin. The European Court of Human Rights said it was considering a special plea to permit the journey.Mr Navalny (44) had been in western Siberia meeting opposition candidates for local elections next month and filming video for one of his viral anti-corruption investigations on YouTube.He fell ill on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow on Thursday and collapsed in the plane’s bathroom, where he groaned in pain before passing out and falling into a coma. The plane made an emergency landing in Omsk.As doctors continued to reject appeals for him to be granted permission to take the flight to Germany on Friday, Mr Navalny’s family said they feared the delay could harm his health or be part of a cover-up to make it impossible to determine what substance caused him to lose consciousness.“We think they are doing it so that the chemical substance in Alexei’s body disappears and there isn’t a trace left - that’s why they won’t hand him over. He’s not in a good condition and we obviously can’t trust this hospital,” said Ms Navalnya.German doctors who arrived on the plane were allowed to see Mr Navalny and told Kira Yarmysh, Mr Navalny’s spokeswoman, that they believed he was in a stable condition and could safely handle the flight.‘Medical decision’Dmitry Peskov, Mr Putin’s spokesman, earlier on Friday denied that the Kremlin was aware of any impediment to transporting Mr Navalny, except that it was “exclusively a medical decision”.Police prevented Mr Navalny’s team from speaking to the German doctors when they visited the hospital, after which the Siberian doctors claimed they had mutually agreed Mr Navalny was not fit to travel.The apparent poisoning would be the sixth such attack on Russian opposition activists in the past five years. Police refused to investigate all of the incidents, while doctors were unable to determine what was allegedly used to poison the activists.The EU expects “a swift, independent and transparent investigation” and that if poisoning was confirmed, “those responsible must be held to account”, bloc spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said in a statement.Mr Navalny’s exposés of official corruption on YouTube have earned him a wide following and a string of powerful enemies among Russia’s officials and oligarchs.As the price of his activism, Mr Navalny has been jailed 13 times for protesting against Mr Putin, sentenced to a lengthy prison sentence that judges abruptly commuted the next day after it sparked a rally outside the Kremlin, and harassed around the clock by trolls allegedly working for St Petersburg businessman Evgeny Prigozhin.In 2014, his younger brother Oleg was jailed for three years in a case Mr Navalny described as “hostage-taking” in retaliation for his activism.BlindedLast year Mr Navalny claimed he was poisoned with an unknown substance that provoked a severe allergic reaction while serving one of his many short jail sentences for protesting against Mr Putin. In 2017, a pro-Kremlin activist attacked Mr Navalny with a chemical that left him partially blind in one eye.The EU and UK expressed concern over Mr Navalny’s health on Thursday, while French president Emmanuel Macron said France and Germany would offer “all necessary assistance to Navalny, in terms of healthcare, asylum and protection”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Mindaugas KulbisAP Belarusian politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who has led the biggest challenge to Alexander Lukashenko’s 26-year rule of Belarus, said in an interview aired on Friday that she would not run for the presidency if the country holds new elections.Tsikhanouskaya, who became Lukashenko’s opposition rival in the contested election of August 9th, in which he was declared the victor, has fled to neighbouring Lithuania. She emerged from obscurity to take the place of her husband, Siarhei Tsikhanouski, in the election campaign after he was jailed in May.“I’m not planning to run myself,” Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview with Belsat TV when asked if she or her husband, a well-known video blogger, would run for the presidency if new elections are held as the opposition has sought.“More than enough,” Tsikhanouskaya, who led some of the biggest protests against Lukashenko since he came to power with the fall of the Soviet Union, replied when asked if she had enough of politics.ProtestsMass protests broke out against Lukashenko, accusing him of rigging the election. He denies the allegations.Tsikhanouskaya said the release of political prisoners is one of the demands of protesters and “new fair transparent elections can restore justice”.The 37-year-old former English teacher was never supposed to be the leader of popular resistance to Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm boss. But when her husband was jailed and other candidates were barred from running in the election, Tsikhanouskaya became the prime challenger to Lukashenko, whose claims of a landslide victory were disputed by the opposition.Earlier this week, Tsikhanouskaya had said she was ready to lead Belarus, a country of 9.5 million, and had called for the creation of a legal mechanism to ensure that a new fair presidential election could be held. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Saudi minister says \u0026lsquopeace must be achieved\u0026rsquo on the basis of international agreementsOne found guilty, three acquitted in UN-backed tribunal into killing of former Lebanese PMCourt rules there is no proof Syria was involved in Hariri\u0026rsquos assassinationFour low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335819.1598019749!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joe biden s hour five takeaways from the democratic convention","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential nominee Joe Biden and California senator Kamala Harris, his running mate, at the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention in Delaware. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesThe Democratic National Convention came to a close on Thursday night with Joe Biden’s speech accepting his party’s nomination for president. The balloons and ticker tape may have been absent this year, but the high point of the election calendar still packed a punch.Here are some of the highlights:The virtual conventionThis convention was like no other, as organisers were forced to design and implement an online-only gathering. The result? A surprising success. For two hours each night, millions of Americans tuned in to the virtual-only event. The curtailed timeframe forced speakers to keep to their allotted time, while the absence of applause, cheers and interruptions kept things moving. Technically, there were remarkably few hitches. The content was slickly produced, and included stylish musical contributions from stars like John Legend and Billie Eilish.‘We the people’\u0026nbspOne effect of the Covid-era convention was to elevate the voice of ordinary Americans. A highlight was the traditional “roll call” when states cast their votes. The result was a Eurovision-style whirl across the 50 US states and seven territories. From the blue-skied expanses of Montana, to the flashing lights of the Las Vegas strip, the montage showed America in all its richness and ersity. On Thursday, 13-year-old Brayden Harrington spoke about how Biden had helped him with his stutter – one of the many personal stories that stood out during the week.The Bernie brigadeThe last time Democrats gathered for their convention four years ago, the event was overshadowed by tensions between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. This time, all efforts were made to ensure that differences between the progressive and centrist wings of the party were kept under wraps. But there was unrest. Supporters of left-wing congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known as AOC, asked why she was given only one minute of speaking time – particularly when Republicans such as John Kasich, former Ohio governor, spoke for longer. Biden too made minimal references to more left-wing policy perspectives during the convention, no doubt disappointing Republicans eager to paint him as an empty vessel for the “radical left”. While mumblings of discontent over AOC were kept in check, the demands of the progressive flank of the party will likely resurface post-election.The ObamasAlmost four years since Barack Obama left the White House, America’s first black president and his wife Michelle still have star quality. Their speeches this week show why. Michelle Obama’s opening night address distilled the essence of her appeal to millions of people – a no-nonsense, relatable person (“you know I hate politics” she said at one point) who nonetheless remains hopeful about the innate goodness of all Americans. Her tone of restrained exasperation with the presidency of Donald Trump, coupled with an urgent appeal to Americans to vote, captured the mood of many in the country.Her husband delivered his speech from Philadelphia, the birthplace of the constitution, on Wednesday night. It was former president Obama’s most direct attack to date on his successor. Trump, he said, had “shown no interest in putting in the work no interest in finding common ground no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends”.Like his wife, his speech also contained an instruction to the millions of Americans watching – to exercise their right to vote in November. Such was the power of Obama’s oratory that he arguably overshadowed vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris who spoke directly after him. Reportedly, Obama had been slated to close the events, but insisted that Harris be given the final slot.The BidensJill Biden may be known to many Americans having served as second lady, but her appearance at the convention will have endeared her to many more. In an innovative take on the traditional convention speech, she delivered her address from an empty school in Delaware.“When I taught English here at Brandywine High School, I would spend my summer preparing for the school year about to start filled with anticipation, “ she began, looking deep into the camera. “But this quiet is heavy. You can hear the anxiety that echoes down empty hallways. There’s no scent of new notebooks or freshly waxed floors,” she said, instantly connecting with millions of parents around the country.But it was her husband who ultimately was the stand-out contributor. So much was riding on Joe Biden’s speech. He rose to the occasion.Less a convention speech than a presidential address, the content and his delivery quietened those who doubted his mental acuity and ability. The challenge in the next 10 weeks will be to ensure that he continues to reach the bar he set on Thursday night.Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"can learn boriss sojourn scotland","story":"They sought him here they sought him there. Was Boris in Tuscany? The Caribbean?Neither, it turned out. The Prime Minister, his girlfriend Carrie Symonds, baby Wilfred and dog Dilyn were enjoying a humble holiday in Applecross, on the western Scottish coast, overlooking the Isle of Skye, in a three-bedroom cottage with a little bell tent in the nextdoor field.The field, it turns out in classic, chaotic, Carry On Boris style, belonged to an irate farmer - who wasn’t happy with Boris pitching his tent and lighting a fire on his land. Now their cover has been blown, Johnson and his family have fled back home three days early.The characteristically unkempt Boris was photographed grimacing outside the hillside cottage, sporting a black beanie hat and a seersucker shirt. The hat is a useful touch on the Scottish coast, whatever the weather. This year is a record year for midges, the wee beasties that eat you alive on northern waters.The cottage costs £1500 a week in peak summer season. That isn’t surprising in Covid-hit Britain, where foreign destinations are subject to sudden quarantine imposition, and seaside cottages are gold dust – with tales of gazumping and prices doubling overnight.Still, however much domestic cottage prices have soared, this Scottish cottage is some departure from Boris’s Christmas getaway with Carrie, when he stayed in a £40,000-a-week villa in Mustique. Little wonder then the internet chatter has been ablaze with musings over whether this cottage was a mere foil: were he and Carrie really staying at the much more luxurious Fairmont in St Andrews, local gossips mused.Boris did not disclose to the press where he was staying for his holidays. The showman journalist of yesteryear was never backwards in coming forwards. But, since he became Prime Minister last year, he has shown an uncharacteristic taste for privacy. He has preferred not to talk about his four children from his marriage to barrister Marina Wheeler, or his child from another relationship.The same shyness applies to his holidays. Foolishly, in light of his curtailed holiday, Boris didn’t go for the public photocall previous prime ministers opted for, in exchange for privacy for the rest of their holidays. This was a mainstay of the David Cameron years, when he was photographed every year in Ibiza or Cornwall, having a snack in front of the cameras. There was no fakeness in the Cameron holidays in Cornwall. They love the place so much that, after he left office, he bought a holiday home there.Do we have a right to know where our senior politicians take their holidays? As a journalist, Boris would accept we do even if he’s in no hurry to tell us where he’s going. And it’s true that the choice of destination does reveal a lot about our various leaders.In his unflashy holiday, Boris was harking back to Prime Ministers of the old days. Harold Wilson always went with his family to his beloved Scilly Isles bungalow. The three-bedroom bungalow was built for the Wilson family in 1959, and was used by his widow Mary Wilson until her death in 2018, aged 102. Last year, it went on the market for the first time, at £425,000.Margaret Thatcher wasn’t really one for holidays – she loved work too much. In 1984, her two-and-half week summer holiday in Austria and Switzerland was crammed with meetings – from visiting a chipboard factory to dining with Austrian Chancellor Fred Sinowitz. She also fitted in appointments with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and former UN secretary-general Kurt Waldheim, and dinner with ambassadors. Gordon Brown, too, was not a natural, fun-loving holidaymaker. More recently, we were treated to the sight of Mrs May walking off her troubles on hiking holidays in Wales and Switzerland.The king of the flash freebie summer holiday was Tony Blair. With wife Cherie and young family, he took full advantage of the fabulous Tuscan 1,300-acre estate, Fattoria di Cusona, in the family of Prince Girolamo Strozzi since 1524. As Boris himself wrote at the time in the , “The Tuscan palazzo of Girolamo Strozzi was where Tony Blair forged one of New Labour’s few hard-edged ideological positions: he was pro-sciutto and anti-pasto.”In that same 2008 article, Boris said it was completely fine that Prime Ministers should stuff Skegness and take their trunks in search of southern sun. It fits with his libertarian instincts that no one should be forced to holiday anywhere they don’t want to.The classicist Boris (his holiday reading in Scotland was the Roman philosopher Lucretius) is particularly keen on holidays in Greece. His father Stanley has just got into hot water for visiting his family villa in Greece during lockdown, in order to “Covid-proof” the property for holiday lettings. Boris also got into hot water as Mayor of London during the 2011 London riots, when he was trapped with his family on holiday in the Canadian Rockies, touring its remote peaks in a campervan with a dodgy mobile phone signal.To be fair to Boris, he is completely used to the discomfort of the British countryside. He spent childhood summers on Exmoor, on the family farm bought by Stanley Johnson‘s father. The farm stars in the new book about austere holidays, British Summer Time Begins – the School Summer Holidays 1930-1980, by Ysenda Maxtone Graham.Rachel Johnson showed Maxtone Graham a photograph of Boris and the family in the farmyard in 1970. Maxtone Graham writes, “They all look happy, but the children look quite grubby, with muddy knees and unwashed, unbrushed hair, clearly wearing any old rugged, stained item they’d found on the floor and managed to pull on. It was all gumboots, dirty gym shoes or bare feet on the scrubby ground.“Rachel Johnson said of the Johnson summer holidays on Exmoor, “’Neglect’ doesn’t do it justice. We were hungry all the time. We eat stale digestives that have been put into the Aga. It didn’t make them fresh. It just made them taste burnt.“Other highlights of Boris‘s childhood cuisine were three chief recipes: rice salad with tinned tuna and roughly chopped onion, apple crumble and Carnation-milk ice cream made by “mixing Carnation with cocoa powder and putting the mixture into a pewter-coloured ice tray...it was basically milky ice with jagged shards.”And, if the Johnson family compound in Somerset is tough in summer, there’s not much cold comfort in winter either. One guest describes snow falling on her head at night – in one of the farm bedrooms.It is this old-fashioned, austere childhood that explains Boris’s approach to clothes, cuisine and comfort – he is indifferent to all three. As someone of his generation, born in 1964, that sort of deprivation was completely standard. Yes, he went to Eton and Oxford and was in the shamelessly plutocratic Bullingdon Club (as, I must confess, so was I), but he was never a rich kid on pampered holidays, effortlessly whisked from Continental hotspot to Caribbean hideaway by private jet.He would have been completely at home in the rugged beauty of the Scottish coast. He would even have taken pleasure in any vigorous gales sweeping through Britain in the aftermath of Storm Ellen. As his holiday clothing so far revealed suggests, he is not one for dedicated wet-weather gear – cagouls, Gore-Tex and the like. Even after suffering a near fatal bout of COVID-19 earlier this year, he is perfectly happy in a beanie hat and yesterday’s pants.Twenty-four years Boris’s junior, Carrie Symonds was brought up in an entirely different Britain. She was born into a world of unbelievable comfort – duvets, air con, central heating and cheap flights to exotic locations. Social media photographs show her in a skimpy bikini, piloting speed boats through tropical waters.She won’t have found much use for a bikini on the Scottish coast - although, if she wrapped it around her head, it might just have kept the midges off her ears.Harry Mount is author of The Wit and Wisdom of Boris Johnson (Bloomsbury)More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive manchester teen joined islamic state twin sister held","story":"A woman from Manchester who joined Islamic State (IS) as a teenager alongside her twin sister is alive and being held with her young son in a controversial camp run by Syrian Kurdish forces, sources in northeast Syria have confirmed to The .Salma and Zahra Halane were 16 when they fled their home in Chorlton in June 2014 to travel to Syria, but their fate has not been known since IS lost the last of its territory in fighting against Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in March 2019.Zahra was recently caught trying to escape from the sprawling Al Hol camp, where she had lived for 16 months, and was transferred last week from a women\u0027s prison to a new high-security extension to Roj camp, where humanitarians worry the most dangerous IS supporters are being moved, sources in the camps said. Salma’s whereabouts is unknown but she is also believed to be alive. Dubbed the terror twins in the media, Zahra and Salma remain committed IS supporters, according to women in Al Hol.The fact that their presence went unreported and that at least one of them attempted to escape illustrates the danger of leaving tens of thousands of jihadists under the guard of a militia in a war-torn country, experts say.The Halane twins, who moved to Manchester at a young age from Denmark, crossed into Syria in July 2014, shortly after IS declared a caliphate.The twins, whose elder brother had reportedly travelled to Syria the year before, moved to Raqqa, the caliphate\u0027s capital, and soon married Islamic State fighters.Their youth and apparent enthusiasm for life under IS attracted widespread attention, and their journey to jihad was later copied by the Bethnal Green trio - teenage girls from an academy in London of whom only Shamima Begum is known to have survived.By early 2019, the once sprawling caliphate was reduced to a small pocket of territory outside Baghouz in eastern Syria. While tens of thousands of IS supporters like Ms Begum surrendered to the Western-backed SDF, many remained missing.Ms Begum’s classmates Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana are believed to have died, but others without identification documents entered the camps, where there was little to stop them giving partial or incorrect biographical information.Last month Russia Today Arabic aired an interview with a woman The  has identified as Zahra after she was caught trying to escape from Al Hol, where some 10,000 foreign women and children live in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions in an annex separate from over 55,000 Syrian and Iraqi citizens in the rest of the camp.“I want to go back home,” the woman says, speaking Arabic.A network of corrupt guards and drivers using hidden compartments inside water tankers has developed to traffic people from Al Hol into Turkey.The cost is about £12,000, according to researcher Vera Mironava, and is often sent by relatives abroad via informal money transfer systems. A Turkish woman who escaped from Al Hol said she knew the twins in the Islamic State and afterwards in the camp.“I\u0027ve known them for over five years,” the woman told The , speaking anonymously. “We visited each other”.“I don’t know where the other one might be honestly but they left together,” she said, referring to Salma and their escape attempt. The  has also reviewed screenshots of messages purportedly from other women in Al Hol confirming the twins are alive. They know Zahra by her nickname Umm Zubair and Salma as Umm Abdurrahman. Zahra has a four- or five-year-old son named Ismail, while Salma’s son was reportedly killed in fighting at Baghouz. The government is believed to have revoked the twins’ residency and subjected them to an exclusion order, meaning they would be unable to reenter the UK. A Home Office spokeswoman said: “We do not comment on inidual cases.” The twins have told camp authorities they are Danish and are believed to want to return there.“They want to go to Denmark because it\u0027s likely that they will be free there, unlike in Britain,” the Turkish woman said. Denmark\u0027s foreign ministry said it does not comment on inidual cases or provide specific numbers concerning Danish nationals in northeast Syria.Relatives in the UK indicated to The  that they know the twins are alive. Speaking at the family’s home in Manchester, their mother Khadra Jama said: “They have been banned from the UK.”Speaking through a translator she added: “The UK government did not help me when they left. They were 16 years-old when they left, they have been away for six years and they left from the airport and nobody helped them.”She declined to comment further, as did other relatives contacted by The . Leaving thousands of IS supporters like the twins in insecure Syrian camps undermines efforts to prevent a resurgence of the group, said Shiraz Maher, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King\u0027s College London.The SDF and the US-led coalition against Islamic State have repeatedly called on governments to repatriate their citizens.“The best disposition option for detained foreign terrorist fighters is for home countries to repatriate, prosecute, and, where appropriate, incarcerate them,” said coalition spokesman Capt Matthew Morris.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"itv declares news bulletins going nowhere swipe bbc claim face","story":"The death of the television news bulletin has been greatly exaggerated, ITV has said, shooting down the BBC’s suggestion that they will disappear within a decade.Fran Unsworth, the BBC’s head of news and current affairs, said the News at Six and News at Ten programmes will soon be redundant as viewing moves to iPlayer.But Ms Unsworth’s opposite number at ITV, Michael Jermey, disagrees. In a letter to today’s , Mr Jermey said: “The death of the television news bulletin on the main national channels has long been predicted by some.“Twenty or more years after I first heard the suggestion, the evening bulletins are still in place. Television is the main source of news for most Britons and millions value the curated news programmes that sit alongside entertainment and drama.“Many people want to be well informed but don’t want to search for news. This will be a case for a long time, and high quality, accurate and impartial news will remain a key part of the mainstream schedules - on ITV, at least.”Mr Jermey, director of news and current affairs at ITV, was editor of the channel’s News at Ten bulletin from 1990-91 and has also run its regional news operations.Ms Unsworth made her predictions in an interview with the , when asked how television news will change over the next five or 10 years.She said: “I think TV journalism will still be around because of the power of pictures to tell a story, but it won’t necessarily be received in quite the forms it currently is. So I still think, ultimately in 10 years’ time, we probably won’t be consuming linear bulletins exactly. I mean, I might be wrong about that. I doubt it,” Ms Unsworth said.“We have to think creatively about what the product is, but that’s the direction of travel and I don’t think that’s changed.”The BBC is “transitioning to a different model for young people, which is all around the smartphone and the tablet”.Asked if the News at Ten might survive, but not the News at Six, Ms Unsworth replied: “Possibly, or maybe the other way round.”The two BBC One bulletins are regularly among the day’s most-watched programmes, behind the regional news.Audiences have doubled for some editions during the pandemic, with the News at Six often drawing eight million viewers and the News at Ten pulling in six million.But the BBC is chasing younger viewers, and research shows they prefer to access programmes online and at a time of their choosing.In her interview, Ms Unsworth also indicated that the busy newsroom at New Broadcasting House, seen in the background during the bulletins, will become much less-populated as the pandemic has proved newsgathering staff can work from home.Encouraging people to work from home could cut down on the need for expensive office space and make it easier for young journalists on relatively low incomes to work for the BBC without having to endure a lengthy commute.She said: “There are aspects of it that aren’t ideal, but there are aspects of it which actually make people’s lives much better - especially in big metropolitan areas where the commute is long and expensive and quite arduous.“So I do think we need to look at how we can make use of what we learned here, in order to make the working environment better for people, more efficient,” she said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mercy statisticians pandemic","story":"Just as the assassination of JFK was the first global event to take place in the age of rolling TV news, Covid-19 is the first pandemic to happen in the age of daily statistical bulletins. We have become glued – or perhaps imprisoned – by the endless onslaught of figures for deaths, new cases, hospitalisations.Our lives can be thrown upside down when they move in the wrong direction – any country that starts registering more than 20 new cases per 100,000 people can expect to be put on Britain’s quarantine list. Last week, the whole of Auckland was sent into lockdown after the New Zealand government announced four – yes, four – new cases in the city.Only belatedly are we coming to realise that the statistics fed to us do not always mean what we think they mean. Until last week Public Health England was counting as a Covid death anyone who had died after testing positive for Covid 19, even if that was months ago, they never showed any symptoms and went on to be run over by a bus.This morning it transpires that the statistics for hospitalisations were compiled in the same way – anyone who went into hospital and tested positive for Covid 19 was counted as a Covid case, even if they had fallen off a ladder. By the same token, the common cold could be made out to be consigning to emergency wards and killing many tens of thousands of people in Britain every year.There’s another statistical oddity we need to be aware of, too. In recent weeks Spain has become the seat of what has been called Europe’s ‘second wave’. Recorded new cases have leapt since bottoming out in June, with 35,582 of them being recorded in the last seven days – constituting a peak nearly as high as that in April. Yet if so many are catching Covid 19 why aren’t they dying or going to hospital?While there has been a small rise in hospitalisations in recent weeks it is nothing compared to what was happening in the spring. In the past seven days, 1407 have been hospitalised with Covid 19 and 122 have died – compared with nearly 900 deaths every day at the height of the epidemic. While you would expect a lag between new recorded cases and deaths, in the spring there was only a gap of seven days between peak new cases and peak deaths. The ‘second wave’ in new cases has been evident for seven weeks now.It is only when you look at the small print in the Spanish health ministry’s daily dispatch that you realise something amiss. Up until 10 May, Spain was only counting in its daily tally on new cases people who had tested positive in PCR tests – the ‘do you have it?’ test which detects traces of the actual virus in swabs of the nose and mouth.From 11 May, however, Spain started adding to the figure people who had tested positive in IgM tests, assuming they had also displayed some symptoms. The IgM test is the ‘have I had it?’ test, which looks for antibodies in the blood. This doesn’t start picking up cases until around 14 days after infection. In other words, Spain is counting in its daily total people who had the virus weeks ago.Sooner or later we are going to have to have an inquiry into the role of statisticians in the Covid 19 crisis. They will have to be put in the hot seat and grilled as to whether they contributed to the sense of panic which has gripped so many people and disrupted normal life for so long.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national trust plans better manage carbon impact visits","story":"The National Trust is planning to discourage visitors from making lengthy journeys to its country properties, according to a briefing document seen by the .Under the proposals, the trust is seeking to “reduce journey times and increase non-car access” to its vast portfolio of stately homes and gardens. In doing so it hopes to “better manage the carbon impact of visiting”.The document said there will come a need for a “shift from a reliance on days out to more flexible community use”.The plans, contained in a 14-page briefing document entitled “Towards a 10-year vision for places and experiences”, will raise eyebrows amongst some of the National Trust’s most loyal members for whom a day out by car to a country property is one of its great joys.Written by Tony Berry, the heritage charity’s visitor experience director, the document was drawn up in response to the lockdown which it says has accelerated “some tricky choices” for the National Trust over “which activities to stop, start and continue”.The National Trust, which has six million members, is proposing 1,200 redundancies to make up for the financial shortfall caused by the pandemic. It employs 15,000 staff and 70,000 volunteers across its huge estate of historic houses and castles. It is not clear how the Trust could achieve more localised visits when so many of its properties are away from urban centres in rural areas hard to reach without a car.It complains that “its current visitor model puts a disproportionate load on peak times” and that the “outdated mansion experience” largely serves “a loyal but (by 2030) dwindling audience”.Mr Berry instead promotes a new vision over the next decade by “building long-term, deep and sustainable relationships with people who live close by. That will allow us to better manage the carbon impact of visiting, by reducing journey times and increasing non-car access”. Critics of the National Trust’s current management will raise concerns that the charity plans to raise more money by increasingly hiring out stately homes for “specialised experiences”.The charity has been accused in recent years of ‘dumbing down’ and under its current proposals to save money its national specialists in areas including textiles, furniture and libraries face redundancy.Dr Amy Boyington, an architectural historian said: “This again feeds in to the whole ‘dumbing down’ of history within the NT, where it believes that to be accessible to everyone it needs to make history flashy, punchy and Disney-esque.”Dan Hicks, author and curator at Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, said: “As well as just houses and gardens, the National Trust cares for nationally significant collections of objects, archives, photographs, and more – so the prospect of losing expert librarians, archaeologists and curators is deeply worrying.”In a statement, the National Trust said: “The Trust document on a vision for places and experiences was an internal discussion document to look at possible ways forward as we emerge from the coronavirus crisis. It is not a strategy.“We remain committed to, and passionate about, the country house and arts and heritage. And we will not dumb down.We will always welcome the enthusiasts and the specialists and provide them with experiences that are tailored for their interests, such as at places like Kingston Lacy and Petworth – where we ensure those treasure houses are presented to the highest possible standard.“But we also want to ensure there is something for everyone in our houses, taking visitors from their first encounters with our heritage and onto discovering ever-greater treasures from different houses. “We accept that the presentation of some of our houses can be improved and we need to make sure they are meaningful and relevant for the 21st century. We want to move away from a one-size-fits all model and to focus on the ersity of our places and ensure we make the most of our collections.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"opposition belarusian politicians questioned alleged attempts","story":"Two prominent Belarusian opposition figures on Friday spent hours being questioned by prosecutors over alleged attempts to “seize power” from President Alexander Lukashenko amid weeks of unprecedented protests.Maxim Znak, attorney for a former opposition presidential candidate, and Sergey Dylevsky, a worker from the Minsk Tractor Works who has emerged as an unofficial blue-collar leader, were interviewed the day an investigation was launched accusing them and other opposition figures of plotting to topple Mr Lukashenko.Mr Znak and Mr Dylevsky told reporters outside the investigators’ offices that they had to sign a non-disclosure clause, barring them from going into details of the case.They have not been charged.Both men were earlier this week named as members of the Coordination Council, an ad-hoc body formed by the opposition to oversee what they believe is an imminent transition from Mr Lukashenko.The European Union called for the criminal probe to be dropped.The Belarusian leader of 26 years earlier this week appeared to be facing an inevitable fall from power. Protests have been smaller in recent days, though larger rallies are expected this weekend. On Friday evening, several thousand people poured out into the central streets of Minsk to form a human chain, waving national flags in defiance of the government crackdown.Passing cars honked in support.Mr Lukashenko was awarded a landslide victory at the Aug 9 presidential election, which was widely perceived as brazenly fraudulent. Subsequent anti-government demonstrations were brutally crushed by riot police, who spent the following three nights chasing unarmed protesters, firing rubber bullets and throwing stun grenades. Nearly 7,000 people were detained across the country.The opposition’s rally of 200,000 last Sunday has been described as the largest in the country’s history.Opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya Friday made her first public appearance after fleeing Belarus the day after the election and surfacing in Lithuania. She urged more workers to join crippling industrial strikes. A visibly distressed Tsikhanouskaya told the news conference that she would come back to Belarus only when she feels safe, but refused to say if she had been intimidated into leaving.The wife of a blogger who was barred from running in the election earlier this year and subsequently jailed, Mrs Tsikhanouskaya called on Mr Lukashenko to step down and said that the brutal crackdown has destroyed his legitimacy forever.“The violence has to stop, political prisoners need to be released and a new, free and fair elections need to be held,” she said.“The people of Belarus will never accept Lukashenko.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"parts britain seeing higher infection rates one four european","story":"The North West of England has a higher coronavirus infection rate than over a quarter of European regions where returning Brits must quarantine for two weeks, the latest data shows.The region has had 46 new infections of Covid-19 per 100,000 people in the two weeks to August 16 - higher than in  95 regions across 11 European countries which have been or are about to be removed from the government\u0027s list of safe travel destinations, according to the most recent data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).  This includes 17 of the 21 regions of Croatia, due to be removed from the safe list at 4am on Saturday, and 13 of the 18 regions of France, which was taken off the list last Saturday.Croatia\u0027s ambassador to the UK said he regretted that the Government here had not taken a regional approach, instead of enforcing quarantine for people returning from any part of the country.Igor Pokaz told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: In Croatia we have, as I said, witnessed these spikes in certain areas - for example in Zagreb in the capital and maybe among the young population.But in Dubrovnik, its surroundings and the islands there were very, very few cases. And I deliberately mention Dubrovnik and the islands as that is where most of the British tourists go. Parts of the North West of England - including most of Greater Manchester - are still under lockdown, with measures including a ban on socialising with other households in indoor venues and visits to friends or families in care homes.So too is Aberdeen, which had restrictions such as the shutting down of pubs and restaurants extended on Wednesday by the Scottish government. The city lies in the region of Grampian, which has the highest regional infection rate in the UK at 60 cases per 100,000, higher than over 112 of regions of blacklisted European countries. Across 401 regions in Europe ning 30 countries, the average rate of new infections in the two weeks running to August 16 for those in a country on the UK\u0027s air bridge list is 13 cases of Covid-19 per 100,000, according to the ECDC data.That compares to 59 cases per 100,000 for  regions in countries where returning Brits are now required to quarantine for two weeks, which will also include Austria as of Saturday.Over half of the top ten worst infected regions in Europe are in Spain. Aragon, the region of city Zaragoza and to the west of Catalonia, is the region with the highest infection rate at the moment, with 336 cases of coronavirus per 100,000 - over 25 times worse than the current UK regional average of 13.Not far behind is Madrid\u0027s autonomous region, where there are 257 cases per 100,000.The region of Guyane is the worst infected in France, with fortnightly cases standing at 245 per 100,000.Several Romanian regions are also among some of the worst hit, with Arges, Vaslui and Prahova seeing infection rates of 182, 179 and 160 respectively. Regions data is based on the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) published in the European Centre for Disease Control\u0027s weekly release.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands highlands overwhelmed rush staycation tourists","story":"Remote communities in the Scottish Highlands and their public facilities have been overwhelmed by a rush of tourists thanks to complete incompetence by SNP ministers, it has been claimed.As more tourists opted for staycations thanks to the risk of being forced to quarantine if they went abroad, businesses across the north of Scotland have reported an influx of visitors from other parts of the UK.Accommodation is fully booked for weeks in parts of the region and facilities such as toilets remain closed, with trowels being left in laybys on the popular North Coast 500 route to help holidaymakers go to the toilet.Recent visitors to Ben Nevis compared it to a rush hour trip on the London Underground and hoteliers have described having to turn families away due to a lack of space, leaving them to sleep in their cars.Locals have reported a significant rise in sports cars and motorbikes on the North Coast 500 route, along with superyachts.These include The £150 million Le Grand Bleu, which was spotted in the Moray Firth. The yacht was owned by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, until he lost it in a bet to Russian-American oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler.Boris Johnson and fiancée Carrie Symonds joined the influx this week, holidaying in a remote three-bedroom cottage on the coast.A teepee-style canvas tent was pictured yesterday near his hideaway home, appearing to confirm reports he spent a few days camping.But, while some businesses are delighted after months of lockdown saw their income dry up, the downside is that some areas are failing to cope with the numbers of visitors.Sir Edward Mountain, a Conservative MSP and convenor of Holyrood’s rural economy committee, attacked SNP minisers for being completely incompetent in providing a strategy to manage the influx, even after Nicola Sturgeon urged Scots to book ‘staycations’ rather than travelling overseas.“As it is, things are rapidly degenerating into a complete shambles. There is no record of who is coming into these rural areas. There are not enough facilities. Many campsites and toilets are still closed or partially closed, he said.“Campervans have nowhere to dump their wastewater - I have been lobbying for some time for the Cairngorms National Park to open a greywater facility in Grantown on Spey but there is currently nowhere in that area and, regrettably, some of the vans are dumping the contents of their toilet tanks in laybys.“People are camping in small village lay-bys, overlooking people’s homes. I have constituents who phone me regularly saying their bedrooms and gardens are being overlooked by campervans. Nobody wants that.Teacher Janet Morrison found Ben Nevis as crowded as “a rush-hour tube train” on a recent trip with her husband and sons.“As a last hurrah before going back to school, we threw camping gear in the car and headed for Ben Nevis,” she said.” It was a great idea but it also occurred to half of Glasgow.“Honestly I’ve been in rush hour subway stations less crowded. As for Covid exposure, I expect that we might as well have been licking an empty glass from a pub in Aberdeen.”Much of the available accommodation from the luxury hotels, to holiday cottages and the few open campsites has been booked solid for weeks.Karen Twist, of the Kinlochewe Hotel in Torridon, Wester Ross said felt guilty after turning away groups of 13 people desperate for a bed for the night.She said: “They probably ended up sleeping in their cars, or maybe in a tent at the side of the road. These are people who don’t know the Highlands - they can’t go to their favourite beach in Spain so they have come up here, thinking they will be able to find somewhere to stay. People are getting angry with the tourists but  it ‘s not their fault, they just want to get a break.”Frustrated locals have set up groups on social media to express dismay at the problems brought about by the influx and a rise in ‘dirty camping’.Peter Crane, head of visitor services at the Cairngorm National park, said: “We are trying to get people to have a plan B and move to a less popular area if there is no parking at their first choice. We have recruited eight rangers to deal with the situation.A Scottish Government spokesman said: “The majority of people visiting Scotland’s scenic sights do so responsibly and this brings huge economic benefits to Scotland’s rural communities.

In Singapore, the virus was transmitted from person-to-person across several clusters before being contained.An expert told Reuters this week that mutations in viruses may be a good thing.

I don\u0027t need to take these other precautions\u0027, he said, saying his agency believed social distancing and self-isolation of the sick were much more important.While he admitted there was no study showing that face masks did in fact reduce adherence to other guidelines, he pointed to the trajectory of cases in countries that have mandated them.There is now a continuous and even increased spread in a number of countries who implemented face masks,  he said.There is a belief that if you just have face masks, you can forget about everything else, you can run your subway with full trains and so on.Norway last week recommended the use of face masks on public transport in Oslo, and Finland on public transport nationwide, putting Dr Tegnell\u0027s agency under growing public pressure to follow suit.Scientific Forum Covid-19 Sweden, a group of 45 Swedish researchers critical of Sweden\u0027s strategy, argued last Sunday in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper that masks should be worn even by students and teachers in schools.The scientific data is clear at this point, with most studies  showing that face masks do limit the spread, and to my knowledge not a single study showing they increase the spread, so why are they so stubborn? said Lena Einhorn, an author with a PhD in virology, who is part of the group.But Jonas Ludvigsson, professor of clinical epidemiology at Stockholm\u0027s Karolinska Institute, who on Monday attacked the group for cherry-picking and misrepresenting studies, said that the different approach Sweden had taken was best explained by the unusual independence of its government agencies.In the other Nordic countries, politicians often have a stronger role than the experts at public health agencies. Frode Forland, Dr Tegnell\u0027s Norwegian counterpart, told the  he believed Dr Tegnell had a valid argument against face masks.We\u0027ve been stressing that it\u0027s still much more effective to keep distance than to wear a face mask, he said. If you keep one metre\u0027s distance, the reduction of risk of infection is about 80 per cent, but if you wear a face mask it\u0027s about 40 per cent.He estimated that even with the rising number of cases Norway is currently experiencing, about 70,000 people would have to wear a mask for a week to prevent a single infection.  On Wednesday, Johan Carlson, the Director-General of the Public Health Agency and Dr Tegnell\u0027s boss, appeared to soften the agency\u0027s stance, telling a press conference that the issue over face masks is not at all dead, and that the agency was working on a review of the available evidence before issuing a list of recommendations to Sweden\u0027s government on September 1st.But Dr Tegnell said the agency was unlikely to recommend face masks to the general public across Sweden, unless the rate of infection increases dramatically.There might be a role for face masks if you have increased incidence in a limited geographical area and you want to do everything to stop it as quickly as possible, he said.But he said that Sweden was seeing a downward trend in most regions of the country. If that changes then of course we need to think about more measures, but its a bit unusual to install more measures when you are in a downgoing trend. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wont people run thenational trust trust nation","story":"The National Trust: could an organisation want a better name? To be national and to be trusted is the ambition of every major British charity, institution, business and political party*. Since its foundation in 1895, the National Trust has, on the whole, lived up to its name. It is the most successful heritage organisation in the world. That is why it has more than 600,000 acres and nearly six million members.It is interesting to recall the trust’s full name. It is The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. This title links buildings with gardens, landscapes and coastline. Whenever people within the Trust have tried to break that link, there has been trouble. Whenever they have strengthened it, there has been success.Historically, there has always been a tension between what a great former supporter, Sir John Smith, called “the Lilies and the Boots”. The Lilies were the aesthete curators who cared about the collections and fabric of the more than 200 historic houses. The Boots were the land agents who wanted to make the estates work and preferred the great outdoors.This tension was usually more creative than destructive. The relationship between what is built by man and what is grown by harnessing nature is a glory of the British landscape. The National Trust has maintained this relationship, and sometimes improved it. That is what ensures its appeal to people of all classes and widely differing tastes. Members understand that it is all one thing – what Beatrix Potter, inventor of Peter Rabbit and Tom Kitten, called “a noble thing”. Because she believed this, she bequeathed the trust 4,000 acres of the Lake District. Its current headquarters is called Heelis – her married name – in her honour.But in recent years, something else has entered the fray. Now Covid-19 has brought it out into the open.This week, two documents have found their way into the public domain. The first, from the NT director, Hilary McGrady, introduced a “consultation” on the “Reset Programme”. In plainer English, she means job cuts. The trust is losing £200 million this year, caused, she says, by the coronavirus.There is the usual patter about bioersity and carbon footprint, ersity and inclusion, “community”, Equality Impact Assessments, “unconscious bias” and “how the collections came to be” (which I take to be a coded reference to the profits of slavery). But in essence, the paper is lists and charts of lost jobs and new ways of working, mainly by centralisation. Food, for example, will come from “Whole Trust Delivery Teams”, not from the land and gardens the trust owns.Although the curators – the trust’s unique knowledge bank – will be cut by less than some areas, their expertise will diminish. Instead of being experts on one big thing, such as paintings, furniture, or textiles, they will be allocated to cover everything in a single century. This makes no sense when great houses have usually developed architecturally, and in their collections, over centuries. Blickling Hall, in Norfolk, for example, is Tudor, Jacobean and 18th century, with 19th-century alterations as well.Behind Ms McGrady’s 41 pages lies an implied admission that the trust has overreached, nearly doubling over ten years. It has been the Cecil Rhodes of heritage colonialism, grabbing too much, too fast. Now it has suffered a non-fatal but worrying cardiac arrest.The other document is called “Towards a 10-year Vision for Places and Experiences. Version 2.1”. It is written by Tony Berry, the Trust’s Director of Visitor Experience. The first thing to note about the Berry plan is its visuals. There are pictures of children building sandcastles, a family travelling in a driverless car playing with screens through a futuristic urban landscape, robots, wheelchairs, and a mock-up of the Houses of Parliament being flooded by global warming. Nowhere is there an identifiable picture of a trust property. There is no photograph of a trust house at all.That last point is presumably intended, since Mr Berry says that the “outdated mansion experience” has to go. He wants “revolution”, not “evolution”. Out goes the “asset-led approach (our primary role is to present the English country house as a distinctive part of our heritage).” In comes the “audience-led approach”: houses should no longer be presented as “country house former homes” but “repurposed as public space in service of local audiences”. “Everywhere… we will move away from our narrow focus on family and art history.”As for gardens, they will not just be beautiful places of tranquillity and “heritage”, but places of activity “where issues like climate change are acknowledged and tackled”. Perhaps some ingenious horticulturalist like the chap who produced the loganberry should develop a fruit called the berryberry in honour of Tony and his visitor experiences. It would be green at all times, and run through one’s system with frightening speed.If Mr Berry’s ideas were to be pursued, several things would happen. First the donor families, many of whom inhabit part of their former house, or a house on the estate, would rebel. If their gift was being “repurposed as public space”, why should they continue, as many do, to lend its contents to the trust, or, on death, to transfer them to it as “acceptance in lieu” of tax, instead of selling them on the open market?Second, the Berry vision might break the great National Trust Act of Parliament of 1937 specifically designed to rescue country houses for the nation. It would also call into question the unique privilege granted to the trust by its original Act of Parliament of 1907, which states that no property once given to the trust can be taken away from it except by the will of Parliament. Why should the trust be allowed to keep buildings whose historic interest it disregards?Finally, National Trust members are usually fascinated by the family stories in its properties, as part of the human dimension and historical context. They do not see most of the properties as neutral backcloths for entertainment, let alone for lectures about the environment. They like their romance and their narrative. Mr Berry loves using the word “narratives”. He says people are searching for “narratives to define their own identities”. Yet he never mentions the great common historical, social and geographical identity in all these places – the word “Britain”.It should, in fairness, be said that the gleam in Mr Berry’s eye is not the agreed policy of the National Trust. Ms McGrady has hurried to point this out. But his views are not untypical of those who talk of “visitor experience” and “interpretation”, yet seem actively to dislike the real experience of a place with a history – a history which, all too often, they seem proud not to know.This is a problem much more widespread than the National Trust – a problem in schools and universities and parts of the public services and the BBC. It is a culture – or rather a lack of culture – which needs to change.Here is the full sentence from Beatrix Potter from which I quoted earlier. “The Trust,” she said, “is a noble thing, and humanly speaking – immortal. There are some silly mortals connected with it but they will pass.”*Footnote: The National Trust covers the whole of the UK except for Scotland. The Scottish National Trust is a separate (and much less secure) body.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"abyssal spider trailer watch poster plot release date","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘Is 2020 not bad enough?’The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

My two biggest fears are spiders and the ocean. I wish this movie luck and success because I will never be able to see it ever,” someone else wrote.Another person chimed in: “WTF is this – since when did someone get into my nightmares and produce a film ?!”The movie generated so much chatter that screenwriter Nelson Yan waded into the conversation, writing: “We can’t tell too much about the monster in this film at this moment but I can promise you guys that we have both small and giant spiders.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Kieran Smith, the creative director at Bake Off’s production company, told Broadcast, “So many people rely on Bake Off for work that we knew we had to work out a plan.”   Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAll contestants and judges lived together at a South East location in July. They were joined by 80 members of the production team, 20 hotel staff and approximately 20 children, as well as multiple chaperones and dog walkers. The strenuous measures began even before that with the team having to self-isolate for nine days and take three Covid tests prior to moving into the South East location. Smith called the six-week shoot a “gruelling” experience, working on a “two days on, two days off” basis.In order to avoid the use of public toilets, transportation from the baking tent to their nearby accommodation also had to be arranged. “It was a massive operation,” said Smith.The creative director revealed that during the filming there was one Covid scare, which turned out to be a false alarm.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a moment that had been a long, long time coming, and when it did Kamala Harris grasped it with both hands.On a night freighted with history, the senator from California officially accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination to be vice president, the first woman of colour thus selected by a major party, and only the sixth woman in total in the US ever added to a ticket.In a speech that spread over more 15 minutes, and perhaps representing the de facto keynote address on the third night of the convention despite top billing going to Barack Obama, her words were at once warm and hopeful, yet firm. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe paid respect to the political pioneers that had gone before her, breaking the ground that would help allow a black American woman of South Asian heritage, build a career such as hers. And she paid tribute to her family, particularly her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who came to the US at the age of 18, and raised Kamala and her sister after their parents orced. She died in 2009. Ms Harris said that when her mother gave birth to her, aged just 25, at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California, she may have struggled to see just what lay in store for her daughter.DNC 2020“On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America,” she said. Ever since Joe Biden indicated in March of this year that were he to secure the nomination he would choose a woman as his running mate, there had been widespread anticipation he would select a woman of colour. Such a strategy appeared all the more vital and fair, following the killing by police in Minneapolis of an unarmed black man, triggering protests for racial justice that swept not just across the US, but around the world.In selecting the 55-year-old former prosecutor, Mr Biden said his main priority had been to find someone who could step into the job on day one, not merely a sound bite for a 77-year-old man, who will be the nation’s oldest president by far should he defeat Donald Trump in November.In her comments, Ms Harris noted that this week marked the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th amendment, which gave some women – white women – the right to vote.“So many of the black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification. But they were undeterred,” she said. “Without fanfare or recognition, they organised, testified, rallied, marched, and fought—not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And these women inspired us to pick up the torch, and fight on.”She named several female civil rights and political leaders — “Mary Church Terrell and Mary Mcleod Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm”. Ms Chisholm was both the first black congresswoman and the first black woman to make a run for the White House, back in 1972.“We’re not often taught their stories,” she added. “But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.”Trump’s strategy for dealing with the DNC is about to backfireMichelle Obama to hail Biden’s ‘grit and passion’ Why I can’t shake my disgust about being forced to vote for BidenMichelle Obama’s keynote speech at DNC expected to be major hitHer comments followed by an equally impassioned and hard-edged address by Mr Obama, who probably for the first time in four years in public, criticised Mr Trump by name. He said he feared for the state of the nation’s democracy should he secure a second term.“I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care,” said Mr Obama. “But he never did.“If Mr Obama’s speech was heavy, and sombre, Ms Harris was able to inject a fair degree of energy into her words. Joe Biden will be relying on this verve to drive his campaign in the final three months, across a country beset by anxiety, economic hardship and the challenge of combatting the coronavirus pandemic. “Years from now, this moment will have passed,” said Ms Harris.  “And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and they’re gonna ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? And we will tell them, not just how we felt – we will tell them what we did.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In fact, I wonderin some ways we’ve ever had it so good.In football, the Leeds, West Brom and Fulham fans among us have the precious memories of heart-stopping promotion moments to cherish for ever.Similarly, while Liverpool fans would have preferred to have partied with their team, none of them will ever forget the evening Cha did them a favour and the title was theirs. And the intensity of Watford and Bournemouth fans’ misery at relegation will have been no less keenly felt without them being present.In fact, let’s be honest, under the circumstances they might well have been far better off at home anyway.Whether we were there or not turns out not to have mattered quite as much as we thought it would.Watching at home, we even got used to the crowd noise sound-effects. They seemed like the daftest idea ever at first, but so skilfully was it done that I was quite at home with it by the end of the season.I’ve loved the cricket too. I can’t tell you how much I normally enjoy being there for these matches, they’re the greatest joy of the sporting summer. Hordes of inebriated, sunburnt fans howling on their teams, whether I’m one of them, or watching at home, are all part of it. But watching the West Indies and Pakistan Test series unfold even without the mayhem of the crowds has been wonderful.Will, for example, Chris Woakes’ performance in the first Pakistan Test live any less long in our fondest memories for having been played out behind closed doors  Will Chris himself be any less delighted with it  Will his grandchildren care as he rocks them on his knee and tells them about his four fabulous days at Old Trafford in the weird summer of  Actually, you could forgive Chris for not being desperate to have crowds coming back. He played out of his skin behind closed doors in Manchester, and saw his football team, Aston Villa, save themselves from relegation in another deserted stadium days earlier.As for the snooker, pandemic or not, spectators in or out or a bit of both, we were still captivated.As it happens, I watched the Fulham v Brentford play-off final, and some of the snooker, in a sports bar in a hotel in Dubrovnik, Croatia, while an absolutely apocalyptic electric storm raged outside. I sat there with a handful of other Brits, riveted to the screens even as the roof of the place proved unequal to the task of keeping out the rain. What I can only describe as a waterfall soon started cascading into the middle of this bar. And yet we watched on, intently, as teams of Croatian hotel staff rushed around us with mops, buckets and a big kind of water Hoover thing. Nothing could tear us away. Even when something fused and it all went dark, we just filed on to the terrace and watched the storm with one eye, while with the other we watched data from the snooker and football flash up on our phones. Pandemics, floods and whatever  — bring on the plague of locusts — nothing, but nothing, can stop the sport getting to us, and us getting engaged with the sport.And nothing, ever, can stop Ronnie O’Sullivan being Ronnie. First he said the players were being treated like lab rats, then he said a lot of his fellow lab rats were hopeless snooker players anyway. And then he goes and wins the thing. You can’t keep a good bad mad man down, can you Why has sport still managed to grab us by the scruff of our necks in these troubled times  I think there are three reasons: Firstly, we missed it so much when it wasn’t there at all. We loved it before, but we really didn’t know how much until it was completely taken away for us.Secondly, without the crowds, though they are missed, what we’ve been left with is the naked, untrammelled intensity of sporting endeavour. There’s no noise and fervour in the stadia to detract from the purity of the contest.And thirdly, most importantly, the bond between sport and us, between those who play it and those who watch it, is so strong that nothing, but nothing, can ever break it.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we can do everything possible to ensure our kids never miss a lesson again.”THE Chinese government’s horric treatment of Hong Kongers and Uighur Muslims violates every human rights law in the book.So we’re pleased that British ministers and royals are plotting to snub the rogue state by boycotting the  Winter Olympics.We know it’s just a gesture. But it’s an important one.

I can excuse the caution of Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson deciding it was better to be safe than sorry in the early days of an unknown pandemic.But as the weeks turned into months and Generation Corona effectively lost a school year, I will never forgive the militant teaching unions for keeping them shut regardless of the social cost.It was a partisan play designed to damage a Tory government at a time when politics should not have mattered one iota.Unfortunately, the A-levels mess this week was depressingly inevitable from the moment the school gates slammed shut.A knee-jerk decision to cancel all exams without waiting to seethere was a way they could be sat in a socially distanced manner meant the current crisis was unavoidable.This situation CANNOT ever be repeated — but I’m fearful it’s already happening.Coronavirus is now being used as an excuse not to provide anything slightly dficult or complicated in all areas of our lives.But when it comes to education, the costs of that lazy caution are too great.I don’t know about you, but much of the development I experienced at school was down to my social interactions and extracurricular activities, rather than solely what was taught on the blackboard.Yet many schools are intending to use Covid- to justy axing breakfast and after-school clubs, banning music lessons and school productions, and stopping sports.It breaks my heart to see these opportunities indefinitely wrested from our youngsters with no scientic evidence to back up why.But it is being caused by a desire from adults to avoid ato normality.A King’s College London study this week revealed a majority of the public are supportive of our nightmarish “new normal”, with  per cent believing employees should be able to keep working at home until a vaccine is discovered and administered.This is cloud cuckoo land thinking. While the progress in Russia and at Oxford University looks positive, there is no guarantee we are going to have a vaccine at all.  So here’s an unpleasant newsflash: Covid is going to be part of our lives for many years. After all, smallpox is the only infectious disease to ever have been eradicated.Selfish adults can ruin their own lives by giving in to irrational hysteria, but they shouldn’t be allowed to destroy the fair education of our kids.The fightback against militant education unions, box-ticking bureaucrats and cruel social distancing regulations for students must begin today.MUCH media attention this past week has been focused on Labour MP Dawn Butler’s dubious claim that London cops are institutionally racist because they pulled over her and a black mate, even though they were driving in a vehicle with tinted windows, meaning the officers had NO IDEA of their colour.What’s far more disturbing is the release of new figures showing violent assaults on Met officers have increased by  per cent in the past three months, coinciding with a period of social unrest sparked by coronavirus and Black Lives Matter protests.Our police are under attack from all angles.They are filmed by baying members of the public desperate to show discrimination but unable to release their own body cam footage.They are accused of racism simply for arresting criminals.Andwe’re not careful, they will give up trying to stop many crimes because the potential repercussions aren’t worth it.DISTURBING news for celebrity lovers: The stars you probably think are nice are usually utter horrors in real le and those with bad reputations publicly are often delightful off camera.That’s my experience after two decades reporting on the entertainment industry both here and in Hollywood.So I’m fascinated to see a celebrity not being nice is now an offence that can see them be “cancelled”, becausethat goes on, there won’t be many left on the telly.This week, in one of the biggest celebrity reporting injustices I’ve ever seen, Nadia Sawalha was hit by claims she is nasty behind the scenes.Believe me, I saw it all over ten years working at ITV Daytime, but can vouch that the Loose Women star is one of the kindest and most genuine people I have ever met in the toxic world of showbiz.To suggest she is some sort of fake is beyond the pale.Nadia is adored by everyone backstage, her best friend is one of the broadcaster’s make-up artists, and she cares deeply about the folk she works with.While some TV stars don’t know the names of crew members they’ve worked with for years, Nadia befriends most of them.The vulnerable, self-deprecating, caring and honest-to-a-fault list you see on Loose is the real woman I know and adore.FIRST the US broadcaster HBO axed Gone With The Wind, before introducing a so-called “trigger warning” to the start of the classic film.Now it has sparked further outrage by doing the same thing to the Mel Brooks classic Blazing Saddles.If this woke attack on our culture continues, soon virtually every old film favourite will come with a sombre introduction by a liberal university professor outlining the social ills you’re about to witness.That got me thinking about what will end up being said before my three favourite films of all time :Grease: Contains ious examples of toxic masculinity, with Kenickie inappropriately invoking rape culture when he asks DannySandy “put up a fight”.The Wizard Of Oz: The scarecrow uses make-up to change the colour of his skin in an early example of blackface.The Sound Of Music: Glamorises a handsome young Nazi soldier called Rolf and features emotional abuse by the captain of his children, including the use of a whistle for discipline.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Office for National Statistics data showed footfall at all retail locations is up to  per cent from a low of around ten per cent in early April.Shopping centres and High Streets are back to  per cent of last years levels of visitors.Ninety-three per cent of businesses are back open. Seventy-seven per cent of firms said there was no risk or a low risk they could go bust.Goods vehicles are once again clocking up their usual mileage. And overall road traffic is just nine per cent lower than before lockdown.Tonight, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “It’s great to see people back out and about, using our roads to boost business and drive our economic recovery.Sun readers will be happy to see that we’re setting out plans to spend £billion on improving our roads — reducing congestion, pollution and journey times. And we aim to cut through red tape and get projects done faster.”But while many drivers are getting back on the roads, commuters are still shunning trains and buses.Train passenger numbers are only at  per cent of last year’s levels. And bus usage is at just  per cent of what it was.In London, where millions of office staff are still working from home, Tube passenger numbers are  per cent the level of last year. The capital’s buses are only  per cent full.A third said lockdown had not aff­ected their turnover for this year. But half said they had seen a decrease.Just one in eight of the workforce remains on furlough.Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s Eat Out to Help Out Scheme to boost restaurants, cafes and pubs was used  million times last week. Data up to Monday of this week showed road traffic just nine per cent lower than the equivalent Monday in February. Britain’s White Van drivers are back to  per cent of pre-Covid- rates.ONS senior statistician Chloe Gibbs said: “Road traffic data shows the number of car journeys is ing to normal levels as people venture out to shops and travel to work.”But many huge firms are still telling workers to stay home and it is having a major knock-on effect on rail, Tube and bus commuter numbers and the wider urban economy.It is a huge blow for cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester. Their centres became ghost towns during lockdown.Cafe chains including Pret a Manger have announced job cuts as a result of having fewer customers.Rail usage has slumped to  per cent of last year’s levels, the Tube at  per cent and buses at  per cent.NEWS that Britain is bouncing back to normality is music to our ears.Last month, behavioural scientists worried that nervous Brits might let the economy tank rather than come out of hibernation. But they underestimated our resilience: High streets up and down the country are bustling once again . . . and ever-dependable White Van Man is back out on the road.We caution, though, against getting lulled into a  sense of security.New ONS data reveals that a whopping  per cent of employees are STILL on furlough, proving the extent to which the job retention scheme continues to prop up the economy.As the scheme tapers off, it’s inevitable that thousands of hardworking and blameless employees will be let go.We’re concerned too about the future of offices — and the cleaners, shop owners and transport workers who depend on their survival for work.On the Continent, the vast majority of city workers are back behind desks. But in the UK, business districts are ghosttowns as white collar employees find they like the work-from-home lestyle.It would be churlish not to celebrate today’s good news. But celebration must be tempered with pragmatism: The scarring effects of lockdown will be felt for months,not years, to come.For a full recovery, we must all make a concerted effort to shore up the economy by going out to work, pubs and the shops.  Tonight Tory grandee Iain Duncan Smith warned: “Office workers, civil servants, those in big companies are really being shown up by the self-employed and small businesses who are all getting back to work and are thus helping the economy.“Its down to these businesses and their office workers to recognise their responsibility, and get back to the office so they can help all the smaller businesses, the cafes, restaurants and bars in the centre of our towns and cities, so they are able to prosper again.”A No spokesman said: “This data shows our economy and society have reopened successfully — and it is hugely encouraging this has happened without a resurgence in the virus.”WE all faced tough times during lockdown and only when it was right did Prime Minister Boris Johnson give the green light for our shops to reopen.But customers have stayed away in droves, leaving the retail landscape looking like a series of ghost towns.Figures from the Office for National Statistics estimate that around , people in England currently have the coronavirus — less than . per cent of a population of around million.And while our neighbours in Europe have flocked backed to their offices, we’ve been more wary over here.Around  per cent of French white-collar workers are back at their desks,  per cent of Italians and  per cent of Germans.Here, it is just  per cent.That has a knock-on for those city centre businesses that rely on those workers for trade, such as sandwich shops and dry cleaners. Not forgetting trains and buses that ferry workers around.Already the job losses are piling up, with Marks  Spencer announcing it is shedding , staff over the next three months.I fear it could get a lot worse with many more thousands of jobs lost across the High Street.Pre-Covid, there was the hustle and bustle of happy shoppers thronging the stores while office workers were spending in their breaks.It breaks my heart to know that shoppers are staying away in their millions and thousands of staff are losing their jobs, with countless businesses being brought to their knees.But it’s not just down to the public, we need action right from the very top of government.People need to have their confidence boosted, and while everyone appreciates we are in unprecedented times and it is tough, it is also the responsibility of the Government to show the way back, just like our counterparts have done in EuropeWe need support for entrepreneurs with low rents in new or abandoned units.

In the Iowa caucuses, the first electoral contest of the campaign to become his party’s candidate, the -year old finished in a humiliating fth place. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch,” Biden declared after the disastrous result. One commentator on the news outlet CNBC was even more scathing: “His presidential hopes are finished.”Yet today, Biden stands on the threshold of the Oval Office. Victory is in his grasp. Having clawed his way back into the primaries and won the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump, he could soon be the most powerful man on Earth. It is certainly his fight to lose. Some nationwide opinion polls put him no less than  points ahead of Trump, whose popularity has taken a battering because of the coronavirus crisis and the consequent economic recession. This week’s Democratic convention, including his own powerful, well-crafted speech last night, will have done nothing to undermine his lead.But with some worrying signs of mental decline, Bidens coronation could mean the reigns of power are actually handed to the hardline leftists around him - rather than to the ageing politician himself.What makes Biden’s comeback all the more remarkable is that his two previous attempts to reach the White House failed so miserably. In  his campaign fell apart after he was exposed plagiarising one of the speeches made by Neil Kinnock during the British General Election the previous year. Some of the passages were lted almost word for word. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to go to university ” asked the Labour Leader.“Why is Joe Biden the first in his family ever to go to university ” asked the Democratic Senator. It does not say much for either Biden’s creativity or his judgement that he had to seek secret inspiration from a socialist mediocrity widely known at Westminster as the Welsh Windbag.In  Biden did even worse, dropping out after a woeful performance in the Iowa Caucuses, where he gained just one per cent of the total vote. During the campaign, he regularly put his foot in his mouth, most notoriously when he described his rival Barack Obama as “the first African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy”.This year, after Iowa, his chances seemed to be heading in the same sorry direction.But then, in the following months, he gradually emerged as the front-runner. This was mainly because the other leading candidates were seen as either too extreme or too unlikeable. Senator Elizabeth Warren was a hard advocate of toxic identity politics who unconvincingly claimed to have Native American blood. Bernie Sanders was North America’s answer to Jeremy Corbyn, complete with revolutionary economics and brutish tax plans. Peter Buttigieg was a sanctimonious mayor of a small city in Indiana, without any experience of the national stage.In contrast, Biden had not only been a Delaware senator for  years, but had also served as Vice-President throughout Obama’s time in the White House. Through these roles, he had built up a reputation as a moderate, helped by his image as an ordinary, down-to-earth guy rather than a member of the Washington elite.The son of a used car salesman, he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the place where the US version of Ricky Gervais’s comedy The Office was set. His popular appeal was further enhanced by his personal story of having to cope with agonising grief, which he spelt out in raw, emotive terms last night.The catalogue of anguish includes the loss of his first we and daughter, killed in a car accident in  and the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in . Yet none of this can hide a disturbing reality about Biden, one that makes him profoundly unsuited to be the leader of the free world or the commander-in-chief of the US military.It is something that the Democrats have desperately tried to downplay, along with much of the media. But, the fact is that Joe Biden is in steep mental decline. Already by far the oldest Presidential candidate in history, he shows all the signs of advancing senility. He might be able to read effective from an autocue, as he showed last night, but in other settings, away from the podium, he regularly stumbles over his words, confuses facts, loses his train of thought, and lapses into coherence. His supporters say that he has always been “gaffe-prone” and that is true, but the problem goes much deeper. In the past, Biden could be sharp, even witty, as he showed in his triumphant  Vice-Presidential debate against the Republican Paul Ryan.Today, when speaking off the cuff, he struggles to string basic sentences together.Without the help of a teleprompter, this is a man who mixes up his we and sister, gets the names of countries wrong, and keeps repeating the same phrases. In one bizarre outburst in Iowa, he called a female reporter “a lying, dog-faced pony soldier”. In another contribution, he declared that he will “choose truth over facts”. With a delusional grasp of arithmetic, he has said that million women will be put back to work by his tax credit plan, that million Americans have been killed by guns since , and that million have died from Covid-. That is why, throughout the campaign, his minders have tried to keep him in his Delaware home, almost like a hostage. Major interviews have been banned, public appearances strictly rationed. It is a strategy that his team cynically justy by claiming that they want to protect the -year-old candidate from Covid-. But the determination to shield the potential next President from any accountability makes a mockery of democracy.It might seem bizarre that the Democratic party should march under the tattered standard of such a weakened general. But from the viewpoint of political operators on the left, his decline actually makes him an ideal candidate.His senility might have to be concealed from the public, but it can be ruthlessly exploited in private. Broken and bewildered, Biden is a puppet whose strings can easily be pulled by his hidden masters. Behind the thin veneer of his supposed moderation, the radicals can seize power and enact their hardline policies, like defunding the police, imposing financial reparations for slavery, rewriting American history, confiscating wealth, promoting transgender ideology, extending public ownership, and widening the scope of affirmative action. Precisely because he is now an empty vessel, a Biden Presidency would mean the ruthless enforcement of woke dogma. In fact, its unlikely that he will last a full four-year term. Therefore his Vice President Kamala Harris, an ambitious operator can start preparing for her reign.But perhaps she should not be too hasty. The Democrats’ opportunism could backfire badlyvoters become alienated by the idea of an enfeebled President.After all, the American political structure – in contrast to our Parliamentary system – is built on the concept of a strong executive headed by a powerful, elected head of state. Already Trump, never one to pull his punches, is running adverts that highlight concerns about the “cognitive decline” of “Sleepy Joe”. The commercials seem to be having an impact. Almost  per cent of Americans do not think that Biden will serve a full term, while other polls show the race narrowing. Trump could also be boosted by revulsion at the radical Democrats’ agenda, especially the collusion with urban violence.In  widespread unrest fuelled by the civil rights movement enabled the Republican Richard Nixon to defeat the Democrats under Hubert Humphrey. Famously, Nixon said that the “silent majority”, ignored by the media, had spoken. Today the same public mood could give Trump a second term.It would be no more than the Democrats deserve for their eagerness to hide the real Joe Biden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has scrapped caps on student numbers but many universities are still grappling with finding enough space for the number of kids who met the terms of their offers. Universities admissions body UCAS found that an extra , students now have the grades to get into their first choice uni.Ms Donelan said in a letter to vice-chancellors: “Where possible, try to prioritise those from disadvantaged backgrounds for admission this year.”The failed algorithm for deciding A-level grades was ditched earlier this week in a massive Government U-turn, meaning more students met their university offers. But universities are concerned about litigious middle-class parents who might take up legal actiontheir kids dont get a place and have to take a gap year, according to The Times.Watchdog The Office for Students has backed the move to give priority to poorer school leavers. Chief exec Nicola Dandrige said:“While it is for universities to make inidual admissions decisions, students from disadvantaged backgrounds must not be allowed to slip through the net as admissions decisions are made.”But one admissions head has said universities may not follow the instruction, which does not set out how disadvantaged should be defined. There is a range of criteria normally relied on to decide who is from a deprived background - including those who lived in particular areas or attended schools where fewer people go onto higher education, as well as those from low-income families or ethnic minority backgrounds.The admissions head said: “In hard choices like these they would normally look at GCSE grades or parts of the personal statement. “I fear that many may already feel they have met their targets for disadvantaged children getting into university this year so have done enough.”Head of the Higher Education Policy Institute Nick Hillman, said it was not a simple decision. He said “If I was a vice-chancellor, or running admissions, I would worry that the wording is open to all sorts of challenges, even legal ones.“Do they have sufficiently robust information to make that fine judgment  Is it based on parents’ salaries, or ethnicity, or other characteristics  It is open to interpretation. How do you satisfy this without opening yourself up to potential legal challenges  No one is against giving an extra leg-up to people from very under-represented groups but there are a lot of litigious middle-class families out there and schools are very keen to ensure their progression rates are good this year.”Head of UCAS, Clare Marchant told BBC Radio  it was the right thing to do to prioritise poorer kids who are less likely to be able to take a gap year. She said: “I think it is absolutely the right intention. I think we know from all of our survey work that those from most disadvantaged backgrounds really, really worry about money. And sothey are deferred for a year, or asked to defer for a year, we’re likely to see a drop-off. And so that’s the real intent behind that.She added: “I think what I would say is that universities are very inidual, they make inidual decisions, but all of them, having spoke to a number of them at Universities UK over the course of the last days and weeks, are looking to be as super flexible — they want students to come to them.”The Office for Students is fighting off demands from campaigners that disadvantaged children should be given compensationthey have to take a gap year. Durham University has gone a step further to free up places and tried to convinced students to take a gap year by offering them a bursary.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Recent changes in transmission are not yet fully reflected in these estimates because the data used to calculate R and growth rate reflect the situation from a few weeks ago. It is also important to recognise that these are estimates, and there is a high degree of uncertainty with them. They added: For this reason, Sage does not have confidence that R is currently below  in England. We would expect to see this change in transmission reflected in the R and growth rate published over the next few weeks as we gain more certainty of what is currently happening.Meanwhile, experts have issued caution over the accuracy of the R rate estimate when cases are so few.Prof Keith Neal said that local Covid clusters can also push the R rate up for an entire region when it may just be one small area.The epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham said: “Making estimates of R with small number of cases becomes increasingly dficult and inaccurate.  Hence the wide range of the estimates.It comes as the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics published today suggests that new coronavirus infections have levelled off.An average of , people per day in private households in England were estimated to be newly infected with Covid- between August  and .This is lower than the previous estimate of , new infections per day for the period August  to .However the ONS said there is not yet enough evidence to say for definite that there has been a fall in new infections in the most recent week, and therefore we continue to report that the incidence rate for England has levelled off.A Government spokesperson said: The very slight movement in the R number reinforces the importance for all of us of staying alert to control the virus and save lives.“But the number is an estimate with a high degree of uncertainty due to areas with lower case numbers or iabilities across the UK. It is only one indicator of how the UK is faring – ONS statistics also published today suggest that infections have levelled off.“We are in a far better position to deal with this virus than at the start of the pandemic but to continue to keep us all safe we must remember to wash our hands, cover our faces, keep our distance and get a testwe have symptoms, so that NHS Test and Trace can keep the virus under control.Earlier today, an intensive care specialist said that he is seeing fewer patients needing critical care for Covid-.Dr Ron Daniels, a consultant in the West Midlands, suggested it could be because those who are most vulnerable to the disease have already died, while a spike in Covid cases could be among young people going out more.He told BBC Radio s Today Programme: I think there are considerations around the positivity rates, but were not looking at the case fatality rates and we’re not looking at hospital admissions.Weve seen cases go up since the beginning of July, and still our hospitals are relatively empty of patients with this condition. We’re seeing very few patients admitted to hospital, let alone requiring intensive care.Experts say that the rise in the R rate is to be expected as the country eases out of lockdown - and warn that the virus is still spreading.Dr Yuliya Kyrychko, a mathematician at the University of Sussex, said: “The latest estimates of R number appear to indicate that in all regions of England, the estimates of R number have either remained the same or have grown in the space of one week. Most worrying about this is the possibility that in several regions, including London, South West and North West, the R number exceeds , suggesting a possibility of a substantial growth in new infections in these regions in the near future. With ONS data estimating around , new infections in England and Wales in the week - August, this means that the infection is still very prevalent across all of the UK, hence it is of paramount importance that people continue to follow the guidance on protection and social distancing to prevent major local outbreaks.The list is based on the percentage of the population with symptomatic Covid- from data submitted by more than . million app users in the UK.Here is this weeks full list...These latest figures were based on the data from , swab tests done between August  to August . Dr Michael Head, a senior researcher in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “We are seeing increases in new daily cases, and now we have an R number estimate that is approximately at the . threshold. The data suggests that as people mix more freely, there are probably increases in community transmission. This is to be expected, but highlights the problems in coming out of lockdown, particularly when there are many thousands of active cases in a population.Suppressing COVID- is extremely dficult. We know that most cases are transmitted within the indoor environment.It’s currently August, and so outdoor meetings are possible, but as we head towards the winter, fewer people will be inclined to meet outside. That raises dficult questions about how best to handle social contacts across the winter months, particularly with the increased potential for transmission from younger populations, who usually have relatively mild cases, on to vulnerable populations where the consequences can be more serious.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politicians have repeatedly let us down, their lack of clarity is baffling and there still appears to be no coherent plan.I’ve watched as people cared for the sick and mourned their dead, and at times, like many of you, I’ve been overwhelmed by dread.Then I look at my friend and colleague Kate Garraway, who has had to bear the burden of her husband Derek being ambushed by Covid- in April.Kate has been extraordinary, which is why I am furious with those who have criticised her for ing to work, when they have absolutely no idea of what she has been going through. She has decided to step back from GMB for a while to concentrate on Derek and their children and those who have criticised her should be ashamed of themselves for making things even more dficult for the whole family. Derek may now be free of the virus but the after-effects have been catastrophic.The poor man has been in an induced coma, and although now more aware of his surroundings, he is still extremely ill.Kate’s mantra “where there is le, there’s hope”, has kept her going, and I reckon on some level Derek is aware of how much she and their children, Darcy, , and -year-old Billy are willing him to make a recovery.Kate has been astonishingly brave and positive throughout this whole ordeal, although she was tearful this week when talking about Derek’s recent birthday. His family sang Happy Birthday to him via Facebook, which must have been bittersweet for all of them.She has had to maintain a brave face for her children and give them some sort of stability for the past five months.To try to further give their lives a bit more normality, Kate went back to work last month.In fact, she was actively encouraged to do so by doctors who felt it was essential for her wellbeing, and frankly, she has to make a living because she has two children to take care of.I know coming back to presenting duties on Good Morning Britain wasn’t easy for Kate, and there have been a few wobbles when she has given updates on how Derek is doing, but all of us are so proud of the way she has coped.That’s why the nasty, malicious carping from moronic trolls is so upsetting. How dare they have a go at Kate for hosting the show and having the “audacity” to smile and laugh at funny items with her co-hosts. It’s sickening, and no matter how much anyone tries to ignore such malevolent cretins, Kate will have been deeply hurt.I had a horrible feeling this might happen, but thankfully the vast majority of viewers wish her nothing but the best, and would be overjoyed to see Derek on the road to recovery. All of us admire Kate’s courage and honesty and know that even in the darkest of times, it’s vital to hang on to positivity and yes, to even have a giggle at something silly or absurd.Watching their mum back on TV gave much needed routine and stability to Darcy and Billy, especially seeing her smile and having fun. They knew it didn’t mean she is not worried sick about their dad, but were well aware he would want her to continue working and providing for the family.As a journalist, Kate has amassed so much knowledge about Covid- and she has also been tested to her very limits.Typically, she wants to pass on that knowledge to help others and is planning to write a book about her experiences and what she has learned during this tough time. It was always her plan to do a self-help book and she had begun it before the pandemic, but now her wise words will be even more relevant and helpful than ever. I can’t wait for the day when Derek is back home, growing stronger every day and the whole family is finally reunited, and I hope she is back at work with us very soon.Happy Birthday Madonna –  years old, mad as a box of frogs but looking utterly radiant surrounded by her children at a party in Jamaica.She can be infuriating and even downright bonkersbut there’s no one quite like her.She’s a trailblazer, was always a staunch ally for the LGBT community before it was trendy and has always paddled her own canoe.Long may Her Madge continue to reign, especially as right now we need some light relief wherever we can get it. I’M not in the least bit surprised that “dad bods” have become so popular among women of all ages. These are the bodies belonging to men who proudly show off rather cute little pot bellies and love handles.Becoming softer round the edges usually happens to blokes after the birth of a couple of kids, when they start to comfort eat due to lack of sleep and stop being obsessed with going to the gym.These boys trade top-of-the-range bikes and tight Lyrca cycling gear for comfy joggers while pushing a pram, and are all the better for it.Having a dad bod is also seen as a sign of confidence, being happy in your own skin and showing that you enjoy le and that having a weekend pizza and a couple of beers is more than OK.I reckon there’s nothing more off-putting than a man with a ripped six-pack who is no stranger to the mirror and exists on steroids and just steamed vegetables.They are usually dull, self-obsessed and not in the least bit alluring.Dad bods are far less intimidating and much more fun to cuddle. Like a lot of men, famous stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron have developed the Dad Bod during lockdown and have been roundly showing off their new physiques.I think they are far more sexy and desirable than when their cheekbones could cut through a home-made loaf. You have to get the balance right, though. When it tips over into a very large balcony hanging over “the nursery” then that’s no longer a Dad Bod but just a big old beer gut and it shows a man who has simply given up and is on a fast track to obesity and a heart attack. BRITNEY Spears is a grown-up woman with two teenage sons, a hugely successful music career and an adoring fan base. But the -year-old has less freedom than an impoverished girl in a Jane Austen novel.Since her much-publicised meltdown in  – when she went into a beauty salon and shaved her head, looking like a little lost deer caught in the headlights – Britney has had very little control over her le.Her father Jamie has legal “conservatorship” over his daughter, basically deciding where and how she lives her le and conducts her career. He also keeps hold of the purse strings.Last year he stepped away from the role, citing health problems of his own . . . and Britney doesn’t want him back.Thirteen years ago she was clearly suffering with mental health issues and needed her father’s help.But now Britney understandably wants control of her own destiny.This week she decided to fight back and took to the courts to have her human rights and civil liberties restored.But her bid was unsuccessful and she will need to wait until February  before taking further action.She is a fragile woman and obviously needs support. But looking at it from the outside, the kind of control her father exerts over Britney’s le seems way too much.Surely some kind of compromise can be reached, with the situation regularly revised to ensure Britney isn’t left feeling trapped like a songbird in a very gilded cage.I SIMPLY cannot begin to imagine the pain actor John Michie and his family are going through right now.This week, the man who supplied the drugs that killed John’s daughter in  had his manslaughter conviction quashed.Louella Fletcher-Michie had gone to a music festival with her boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, who gave her the hallucinogenic C-P drug and filmed her tripping for hours. Belatedly realising she was in real trouble and crying for her mum, he phoned her family. They rushed to the scene but were too late to save her. Crucially, he did not at any point take her to a medical tent or seek expert help.This week a High Court judge decided that evenhe had called for paramedics, it was not clear Louella would have survived – so Broughton’s appeal against his sentence of eight and a half years was upheld. Broughton has to live with his actions but not from behind bars.Meanwhile, John and his family – who have maintained a dignied silence through the most recent twist of the kne in their tragedy – continue to mourn their lost Louella.For them, it is a le sentence of heartbreak and pain.JUST when you thought reality telly’s Below Deck couldn’t get any better, they go and set a whole series in Tahiti.There are all the usual shenanigans. Entitled and demanding guests, the crew squabbling one minute and at it like rabbits the next and Captain Lee sailing above it all while coming out with hilarious one liners like: “I’m madder than a p***ed-on chicken”, which I plan to use as often as possible in my daily le.Meanwhile, all the action takes place amid the amazing sunrises and stunning sunsets of the South Pacic.It’s no exaggeration to say that this utterly ludicrous, vacuous and extremely daft series has kept me sane during these scary times.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We stutter.”Video of the inspiring two-minute speech has obtained more than .million views on Twitter.The courageous boy added: It was really amazing to hear that someone like me would become vice president.He told me about a book of poems by Yeats he would read out loud to practice.He showed me how he marks his addresses to make them easier to say out loud. So I did the same thing today.Brayden praised Biden for making him feel better about his speech disorder.He told his audience: “I’m just trying to be a kid. And in a short amount of time, Joe Biden made me feel more confident about something that’s bothered me my whole le.Joe Biden cared. Imagine what he could do for all of us.“Kids like me are counting on you to elect someone we can all look up to.Braydens speech prompted widespread support from social media users.Pam Keith, a Florida Dem nominee, tweeted: I want to say this to Brayden Harrington .Young, Sir: You humble me. I am in TOTAL AWE of your courage. You have a titanic spirit and unshakeable will.You made the worst bully look pathetic, ridiculous and so very small. I salute you.Another Twitter user wrote: I’m an adult who gets nervous talking to a group of  people I know. Brayden Harrington is a  year old struggling with a stutter who spoke to millions of people.I can’t even comprehend that kind of courage.Journalist Dan Rather wrote to Twitter: Brayden Harrington, the -year-old boy with a stutter.Pure, unnished, courage.Last year, Biden opened up about his lelong struggle with a speech problem.His reveal came after Donald Trumps former press secretary appeared to mock him for stuttering.Sarah Huckabee Sanders faced backlash after posting about the former US Vice Presidents delivery during Thursdays Democratic debate.In a since-deleted tweet, Sanders wrote: “I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I hhhave absolutely no idea what Biden is talking about,” as the debate was wrapping up.Biden had been discussing children who suffer from speech impediments when he made the stumble.He later took to social media to talk about his battle with the speech disorder.Biden tweeted: I’ve worked my whole le to overcome a stutter. And it’s my great honor to mentor kids who have experienced the same. It’s called empathy. Look it up.Stuttering and stammering - both considered the same thing - refers to a relatively common speech problem in childhood which can persist into adulthood.A stutter can present itself in a few ways it can cause the person to repeat syllables, make words sound much longer or sometimes words can get stuck and not come out at all.It can y in its severity in dferent people, some who are barely affected at all while others can find the condition debilitating.It’s hard to say what causes children to start stammering but the NHS reassures parents that it won’t be caused by anything they have done.ltgtAccording to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Common Disorders, approximately three million Americans stutter.The NIDOCD explains: Stuttering affects people of all ages. It occurs most often in children between the ages of  and  as they are developing their language skills. Approximately  to  percent of all children will stutter for some period in their le, lasting from a few weeks to several years.Most children outgrow stuttering. Approximately  percent of children recover from stuttering. For the remaining  percent who continue to stutter, stuttering can persist as a lelong communication disorder.They add that the development of speech is complicated and depends on many factors and that problems can occur when parts of this developing system aren’t quite coordinated.There are two types of stuttering, developmental and neurogenic.Developmental stuttering is the most common type and occurs in young children while they are still learning how to talk.Neurogenic stuttering is the type that could show up in the aftermath of astroke, head trauma, or other type of brain injury, according to the NIDCD.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way.

But many forces do not publish data for misconduct.One recently retired officer said: “Until all our police forces come out and provide figures the public will believe we are happier hiding the reality of police corruption than dealing with it.“No wonder shows like Line Of Duty are so popular. We should be using its success to encourage more openness.But instead, many forces are battening down the hatches, trying to push the subject off the public agenda.”As fans hang on for season six of the hit drama — and catch up with re-runs — here are some cases of police corruption where real le was stranger than fiction.IN Line Of Duty, “H” is the codename for a senior officer, or possibly a group of officers, who control bent coppers on behalf of an organised crime gang.Real-le corruption has reached the upper ranks of the police also.Met Commander Ali Dizaei was jailed in  for perverting the course of justice, using his position to frame a man.He became the most senior copper in  years to be given a prison sentence.That represented a spectacular fall from grace for a man who had been in charge of , officers across West London.A few years ago, I tracked him down and persuaded Dizaei to meet me. He insisted HE had been framed by corrupt, racist officers afraid he would spill the beans.It was hard to work out whether this was a smokescreen orhe really had been caught up in something so toxic it had cost him his career.CAREER-crook Hunter, played by Brian McCardie, spread murder and mayhem through Line Of Duty’s anti-corruption unit AC-.But his crimes pale beside those of real-le bank robber and cocaine baron Mickey Green, who had close links with corrupt police here and in Western Europe in the Eighties and Nineties.The West Londoner employed a stable of bent coppers to stay one step ahead of the law. It is alleged he got corrupt detectives to frame his criminal rivals too.Green is believed to have bribed his way out of a drug-smuggling charge in Spain. He already had links to Italian Mafia and Colombian drug cartels, pulling off huge cocaine deals with the world’s most dangerous drug baron, Pablo Escobar.One ex-detective believes Green had enough evidence of corruption to bring down many senior officers in the South East, making him untouchable.IN series three, DC Arnott Martin Compston is accused of being the gangland informant and corrupt cop known as “The Caddy”.Arnott also finds himself framed for the murder of Lindsay Denton.In real le, officers working to expose corruption risk facing trumped-up charges because they are considered “rats” by colleagues. . . sometimes even including law-abiding officers.They know these allegations come with the territory.One of my sources told me that, in the summer of , an anti-corruption officer on one force was accused of sexually abusing his niece.It later emerged she had been pressured by criminals to make the complaint.The case was dropped when the niece withdrew her statement to police.That came after her father was recorded referring to the accusations as . The father later admitted he had convinced her the abuse had taken place.“That manshould have been prosecuted, at the very least, for wasting police time,” the same detective believed.“But the officer in question begged his superiors to drop everything – all for the sake of his family.”The officer never recovered from the ordeal and was eventually moved from the anti-corruption unit to a desk job.The same detective added: “He split up with his we and his kids can’t get what he was accused of out of their heads. Poor b*****d.”ZEALOUS Ted Hastings Adrian Dunbar heads up Line Of Duty’s AC- unit.I have encountered a handful of Hastings types over the years but one stands out.I first met “Bfo” in the mid-Seventies, when he was chief of detectives at a suburban police station and I was training as a journalist.Bfo wore his heart on his sleeve, was softly spoken, respectful to women and prepared to talk over a pint with the “enemy”, as journalists were considered by police at the time. There is no way Bfo was on the take. Like Hastings, he earned incredible loyalty from his detectives as he was ready to put himself on the line for them.Bfo later headed an anti-corruption unit in a notorious period in police history.“No one  wanted the f***ing job,” he told me. “But I saw it as a challenge and I knew the bosses would keep well away from me. Most of them hated my guts and wanted me to screw it up.”Like Hastings, Bfo was brilliant at getting inside the heads of his colleagues.“I know instinctively when something’s wrong,” he said. “I don’t get angry with people who lie to me. I keep it gentle, low-key.“Then they usually tell me the truth. You can’t run an anti-corruption unit on fear. You need to pull togetheryou’re to smoke out the bad apples.“I can see a lot of me in Hastings. But he needs to watch his back. He’ll be sacricedhis superiors get twitchy.”A FORMER policeman I have known for more than  years, nicknamed “The Grinder”, makes Line Of Duty’s corrupt John Corbett – played with such force by Stephen Graham – appear relatively harmless.Grinder has always claimed he is NOT corrupt and that he was only labelled as such by scheming colleagues.That came after he infiltrated a gang of renegade crooked officers in a bid to help his superiors bring them to justice.Instead, those officers claimed HE was the corrupt one. Most of that group took early retirement before any charges were brought, so it is impossible to know for sure who was telling the truth.When I visited Grinder at his villa last year, I could immediately see that he had earned a lot more money over the course of his career than most ordinary police officers could claim to.Behind the wrought-iron gates was a substantial property with a long driveway, swimming pool and tennis court.There were CCTV cameras dotted around, while two rottweiler guard dogs bounded out of the back door.Grinder, now in his seventies, said: “I don’t deny I had to pull a few stunts back then.“But I wasn’t a bent copper like they all tried to make out.“The ‘rules’ of the game were very dferent back then.“You had to do certain things in order to put the bad guys away.”A GANG similar to Line Of Duty’s Organised Crime Group was led by Liverpool hood Curtis “Cocky” Warren.After being acquitted of drugs charges in , Warren crowed at customs officials: “I’m off to spend my £million from the first shipment and you can’t f***ing touch me!”Having police on the payroll was crucial to his criminal empire. Among them was Elmore Davies, a senior copper with Merseyside Police who was jailed for trying to get one of Cocky’s acquaintances off a firearms charge. Cocky also used corrupt officers to help him land huge shipments of cocaine from Colombia.A former Liverpool detective said: “Cocky made sure a lot of his bent coppers joined him on actual dealings with the Colombians. That meant they couldn’t wriggle out of involvement. They were completely incriminated, just the way Cocky wanted.”Warren was jailed in  and is still behind bars.Some in the Liverpool underworld fear his eventual release will spark a gang war with corrupt police at its heart.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Stay safe and look out for each other.He said a widespread economic lockdown would have been wrong. and would have needlessly closed businesses down when they werent a factor in spreading the virus.A spokesman for the Greater Manchester Authority said: Greater Manchesters leaders main objective this week was to avoid a local lockdown in Oldham so we are glad we have been able to agree this with the Government.Our second objective was to ensure areas with consistently low infection rates were taken out of the restrictions so the decision on Wigans restrictions being lted is a welcome one.We have all been concerned about the situation in Oldham and this is why we have sought to work in partnership both with the local council and the Government to agree the most suitable and effective measures, as set out by Oldham Council.Increased measures to restrict the mixing of households are a much more sensible approach than local lockdown. We are pleased that the Health Secretary has listened to what leaders said in their letter to him yesterday.Meanwhile Wigan, Rossendale and Darwen are to be released from the new rules after a drop in cases.Jake Berry, the MP for Rossendale and Darwen, said hed just spoken with the Health Secretary Matt Hancock and it was really welcome news for our area.He told constituents in a video on Facebook: Were taking a much more targeted approach.Because of the huge effort, Rosendale and Darwen will be coming out of the increased restrictions that we have seen over the last few weeks.Where we live here is going to be covered by the normal national restrictions.Some parts will be unable to visit friends and family from other households - even in the park or at the pub now.Previously they were only banned from meeting inside their homes and gardens.However, the other half of the area will see restrictions lted completely after a drop in cases there.The following areas of Blackburn with Darwen remain areas for intervention and the new restrictions on household gatherings and socialising will apply:Areas in Blackburn with Darwen where all restrictions have been lted are:Cases of COVID- are rising quickly in Birmingham, the Department said this lunchtime, with . cases per ,.They have added Birmingham to the areas of concern watchlist but for now they will to face any additional restrictions.. per cent of people are testing positive - and half of cases are among young people aged  - .

It was due to end in England and Wales on Monday. Mr Starmer welcomed the extension, but said it should be extended further.He said: The government’s eleventh hour u-turn on the evictions ban was necessary - but such a brief extension risks offering only short-lived relief to tenants.The ban must not be lted until the Government has a credible plan to ensure that no-one loses their home due to Covid. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has now confirmed the four-week extension. But Sir Terence Etherton, Master of the Rolls - Englandaposs second most senior judge - confirmed the extension in a letter this afternoon. He said Justice Secretary Robert Buckland had written to him yesterday to confirm the extension. He wrote: The CPRCmet earlier today. It considered the extremely unusual nature and timing of the letter of direction from the Lord Chancellor but by majority considered that it was bound to follow the direction. He aded: This -week extension to the stay relating to housing possession cases, will allow for further work to be done to prepare for the stay to be lted which in many respects can be welcomed. The Housing Law Practitioners Association also said it had been confirmed to them, tweeting: We have now had official confirmation that the stay on possession proceedings will be extended to  September. Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps hinted a u-turn was on the cards. He told LBC radio: I know that getting that balance right between the renters and the landlords is something that my colleagues in the housing ministry are working closely on, and I think they will make further announcements about it shortly, which Iaposm not privy to right now.Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said:   “The government has today recognised the very real danger that tens of thousands of renters are in. It is right for the government not to lt the ban when it risks exposing people to eviction and the threat of homelessness with no means of defence. “The government must use this short window of time wisely to put proper safeguards in place for renters. People are still falling behind on their rent – , private tenants since March - leaving them vulnerable when the ban does end. And we all know even more economic storm clouds are gathering. “A bullet may have been dodged with this extension, but as soon as Parliament s, it must give judges extra powers to stop renters being evicted because of ‘Covid-arrears’.   Facing eviction this Christmas, is not a present anybody wants.” But the National Residential Landlords Association did not welcome the news.  Ben Beadle, CEO of the National Residential Landlords Association has said:“A blanket extension is unacceptable, especially so close to the deadline.   “An enormous amount of work as gone into finding a balance between supporting tenants who have been affected by the pandemic and preventing signicant financial harm to landlords, in accordance with the Government’s promise. This announcement satisfies no-one.  “Landlords have been left powerless in exercising their legal right to deal with signicant arrears unrelated to Covid-, antisocial behaviour and extremely disruptive tenants who make le miserable for their neighbours and housemates.   “Private landlords cannot be expected to foot the bill for government failure. There must now be a plan to support households to pay their bills and to compensate landlords fully for their lost income.  “Only this will give both tenants and landlords security and reduce the risk of widespread tenancy failure.” "},{"url":null,"title":"michael goves department alone spent","story":"NewsMichael Goves department alone spent £m on consultants and marketing during Covid- crisisEXCLUSIVE: The Mirror found a string of government contracts signed by the Cabinet Office for \"consultancy services\", \"intelligence\" and \"media analysis\" related to the Covid- epidemic from May to August ShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG News \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Many deals were handed out without any competition, under urgent procurement arrangements to react to the pandemic. London-based start up Signal AI was paid almost £, to perform media analysis on the Governmentaposs Covid- communications, while accountancy giant Deloitte was paid £ million for urgent consultancy services. Another urgent contract saw the taxpayer fund a £, survey of the people of Tunisia about their attitudes to the coronavirus pandemic. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: As part of the British Embassyaposs work in Tunisia small scale research was commissioned into attitudes and behaviours to COVID- to inform the Tunisian Governmentaposs public health communications.

US firm Efficio was paid £, to give advice on the provision of consultation for the effective management structure operating model of a large, complex Covid- contract. Rachel Reeves, Labouraposs Shadow Cabinet Office Minister said: Spending millions on media work won’t make up for political incompetence or mixed messages from ministers.No amount of spending on public relations will undo the damage Dominic Cummings did by challenging the sense we were all making sacrices together.All too often the Government’s approach to procurement has been shambolic or questionable in its decisions and so we need more robust checks and balances put in place. Another contract was handed to Tussell Ltd, a firm owned by Angus Tugendhat, the cousin of Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, and former Tory minister and peer Lord David Young. They were paid £, for an analysis of Government contracts handed out in relation to Covid-. The firm has a system which aggregates contracts and invoices from multiple data sources across government and provides analysis of spending by all departments. Mr Tugendhat told the Mirror his cousin had no input into the business. He added that the contract had been awarded directly because his firm offered a service the Government needed, and no other company could provide.  It was revealed earlier this month that Topham Guerin, the firm of political campaigners behind the Toriesapos  digital campaign strategy, were handed £m without competition for campaign coordination services.The firm is understood to have been behind the decision to rebrand the partyaposs Twitter account as a fake fact checking service during election debates. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “Topham Guerin were awarded a contract to help advise and generate social media content to support coronavirus communications.“This has been published on  gov.uk  in the normal way, in line with transparency rules. “This work has helped to ensure that vitally important public health messages are effectively communicated to the public.” Theand Open Democracy yesterday revealed departments across Whitehall had spent as much as £ million purely on Covid- ‘consultancy’ contracts.PA Consulting services were handed £ million for “consultancy support” on a project to design and build mechanical ventilators.

Lulworth coastguard said the swimmer got into trouble in choppy seas at Durdle Door, Dorset, on Thursday afternoon. The man, believed to be in his s, apparently tried to swim back to the shore but was stopped by mph winds and enormous waves that rose well over his head. Another man who ran into the sea to try and help him also got into dficulty before dozens of people on the beach came to the rescue. More than  people linked arms to enter the sea and successfully brought the two men back to shore. They withstood being buffeted by the waves and an eye-witness said she feared for multiple casualties, but miraculously everyone emerged unscathed. Witness Emily Foote said: The foam was like a washing machine and at one point I thought we were going to end up with  casualties in the sea rather than just one.  With every attempt they got a little bit closer and were finally able to reach him. The whole beach applauded when the two men got back and they didnapost need any help from paramedics or anything like that. Iaposve never seen the beach like that and full credit has to go to everyone who risked their own lives to save the swimmer.  Jeanette Warren, from Portsmouth, Hants, said: He was confidently swimming for some time until an awful gust came and literally swept him so far out. He was actually very good, staying calm and then giving it his all to swim with the waves. A small crowd quickly became a very large crowd and people on land began to realise he was in distress. A statement by Lulworth Coastguard Rescue team said: With the large waves and spring tides of late, we strongly discourage sea swimming and playing around in the surf, especially on exposed beaches such as Durdle Door.

The denim perennial has been in production since  and is a favourite of Hollywood stars and manual workers alike. Second place went to the s-defining Mary Quant-style miniskirt, while Leviaposs denim jackets, UGG boots and Fred Perry polo shirts completed the top five. The poll of , UK adults saw Barbour wax jackets, Ray-Ban Wayfarers and Hunter wellies also feature on the list. Thomas Berry, director of sustainable business for Farfetch, which commissioned the study as part of its drive to raise awareness of sustainable fashion, said: Now more than ever, customers are interested in making considered purchases that will stand the test of time. From pre-owned denim to iconic designer pieces, customers are willing to seek out and to invest in pieces that are conscious, durable and also timeless, regardless of trends. Nearly a fth of those polled named Christian Louboutinaposs famous red-bottomed shoes as an iconic statement piece. Although in terms of memorability, the classy designer shoe only came one place above the gardeneraposs favourite - Crocs. It also emerged that at some point in their lives,  per cent of adults have owned a classic Ralph Lauren polo shirt, and one in six have worn some iconic Nike Air Max trainers.  Half of those polled would still wear any of these memorable trends from years gone by, and three in  have hunted in a charity shop or vintage store to find one specic piece of clothing. Many of the items in the list have been handed down to Brits, who didnapost quite realise what they had, as three in  got rid of items given to them by older relatives, only to regret it later. But just under six in adults now say theyaposd rather have fewer quality pieces in their wardrobe, than lots of cheap items which wouldnapost last as long.  The average adult spends about three hours, and £, a month in charity or vintage clothing stores, with a third actively enjoying aposthe huntapos of finding the perfect garment. More than one in  have even spent a DECADE or longer searching high and low for that one mythical item which will complete their wardrobe.And  per cent agree that fashion is cyclical, and what was once trendy will become trendy again in the future.Despite the desire for more long-lasting clothing, only eight per cent of Brits say they aposalwaysapos shop sustainably, although  per cent apossometimesapos manage to.# The research, conducted via OnePoll, also found  per cent have cut down on clothes shopping in general to reduce their carbon footprint, while  per cent buy from stores which have good green credentials. While a further four in  will be sure to clear space from their wardrobe by giving away old clothes, before buying anything new.Following the findings, Farfetch have created a aposfashion footprintapos tool which gives people the chance to consider the environmental impact of their shopping. Thomas Berry added: The tool allows consumers, when choosing to make a purchase, to consider which materials can reduce the environmental impact of their purchases, and to see the environmental savings of incorporating pre-owned products into their wardrobes. To remind people of the iconic items and test their knowledge, Farfetch have created the ultimate quiz for fashionistas to try out. The top  most iconic fashion items of all time . Leviaposs s .

Saaba Mahmood, , pocketed state benefit handouts on behalf of her aunt and uncle over a five-year period - even though she knew they were living in their native Pakistan. But when she was caught, Mahmood, of Heald Green near Stockport, Greater Manchester, said she did not realise she was unable to claim on the behalf of relatives who lived abroad. She also claimed she lacked skills in understanding how to live in society as a responsible adult and added that she did not realise her offences were not victimless crimes. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Mahmood admitted four charges of failing to disclose information to make a gain and one offence of fraud but was given  months jail suspended for  months. Prosecutor Julian Goode said: These are cases relating to benefit claims on behalf of her aunt, uncle, and mother. She acted as an appointee for them and in that capacity and she had a duty to disclose changes in circumstances that would impact the claim. She claimed Disability Living Allowance on behalf of her aunt between January  and September , and Employment Support Allowance between February  and October . She was acting as her auntaposs appointee and as a result both benefits were paid directly into her bank account. There is evidence to show her aunt left the UK in January  to go to her daughteraposs wedding in Pakistan but fell ill there and did notto the UK until  October . The defendant did not disclose this and continued to receive those payments in her behalf between February  and October . These payments totalled £,.. Her uncle claimed Disability Living Allowance between November  and October  and Employment Support Allowance between October  and October . The defendant became his appointee in July . She got the credit into her bank account, but he was out of the country between November  and October  and again between October  and June  and June  and December . The defendant failed to report the change and the overpayment was £,.. The defendant became an appointee for her mother in July  and on  August  she said her mother was able to care for her uncle and received Employment Support Allowance. On  October  she reported the change that her mother had stopped caring for her uncle. The overpayment in this case was £. The total overpayment was £,.. The defendant was interviewed on  February last year and confirmed her aunt had been living in Pakistan between  and . She said she did not know she needed to reportsomeone was abroad. She said she had reported that her uncle was in Pakistan in September . She said she completed forms between June  and November  in which she failed to mention he was in Pakistan. A breach of trust was involved. At an earlier hearing a lawyer for Mahmood said she would benefit from programmes to help her understand these are not victimless offences. They added: She lacks skills in understanding how to live in society as a responsible adult. At Thursdayaposs hearing in mitigation defence lawyer Isobel Thomas said: She is genuinely remorseful and has repeated this on a number of occasions to let the court know how sorry she is. She pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Only one of the claims was fraudulent from the outset and that claim was worth £.  Immediate custody will have a signicant harmful impact on others. She has eight children aged between one and  who have to go into foster care as her husband has schizophrenia and is unable to care for them. Her youngest two children are very close to her and sleep by her. One of her daughters has been assaulted in the past and appeared as a witness at a Leeds Crown Court trial. She is nervous of men and other people. Her husband gets very distressed when she isnapost there and may have to go to hospitalshe were sent to prison. She is a carer for her aunt who has dementia, hepatitis C and kidney failure. She has never troubled the courts before and no longer claims benefits. She would comply with all requirements of a suspended sentence. Mahmood was also ordered to complete  rehabilitation requirement days and  hours of unpaid work."},{"url":null,"title":"new data shows surge new","story":"NewsCoronavirus surge in Swindon - new cases in week as Bury and Stoke infections on risePublic Health England data released today reveals  local authority areas have rates of  new cases per , or higher, with  showing an increase in seven daysShareCommentsByDave BurkeIan Jones:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-numbers-uk-deaths-rise-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

He is merely resting, avoiding those who would give him the last rites. Last week’s decision to close the Bradley surface mine in Co Durham was greeted as the death knell of the fuel that made Britain prosperous. But the obituaries are premature. Big open-cast mines and tiny underground collieries are still in production and a new deep pit is planned in Cumbria. We have dug coal since Roman times and our love affair with burning “black diamonds” in our hearths is not over yet. Despite virus problems, coal mer­­chants insist they have “plentul stocks for everyone to enjoy on their solid fuel fires for many years to come”. Good news for those who like to watch the flickering flames and gassy spurts of fire. The Government has set a deadline of  for a carbon-free UK and  for phasing out coal-fired power stations. Already, weeks go by without it being used for electricity generation. But coal is still needed for making steel and cement. And fireclay, found in the same seams, is vital for brick making. The last big deep mine, Kellingley in North Yorkshire, closed in . However, more than  surface mines continued operating at the end of that year and replacements are in the pipeline. Eight million tons of coal were used in the UK in . Two-thirds was for pur­­poses other than electricity generation – and % was imported from countries such as the US, Russia and Colombia, arguably with a bigger carbon dioxide footprint than home-produced coal. And that’s important because environmentalists insist, correctly, that coal is earth’s number one pollutant – though our contribution to global CO from coal is minute compared to China and India. That doesn’t stop campaigners fight­­ing to scrap the planned Woodhouse under­­­sea colliery in Cumbria which would extract . million tons of coking coal a year for  years – mainly for export to European steel works. The site, close to Cumbria’s last deep pit in Whitehaven, which closed in , would create  jobs. But despite West Cumbria Mining insisting it will be very dferent from th-century pits, opponents demand: “Leave The Coal In The Hole!” Had these campaigners been around a century ago, when King Coal employed . million men and women, they would have been laughed off the muck-heap but local politicians are nervous in the face of the well-­organised and funded Green lobby.  Back in the North East, Bradley, near Dipton, is closing with the loss of a dozen jobs after an application to extend its operations was rejected. Gavin Styles, boss of owners Banks Mining, says: “I am angry, frustrated and sad to have to tell my highly skilled and loyal team, most of whom live in surround­­ing communities, that we will no longer be able to employ all of them even though there is signicant demand for the coal and fireclay they produce. “While British industry still needs coal it is obvious that it is better for our climate and for our jobs to mine it here rather than exporting our jobs and increasing global greenhouse gas emissions by relying on coal imported from thousands of miles away.” Durham and Northumberland were the heartlands of the coal industry. The earliest record of mining is in  and by the th century it was the staple industry of the North East. At its peak after the First World War mining here employed more than , – my family among them. I should ­declare an interest: my great-great-greatgrand­father Joseph was manager of Ryhope colliery, Sunderland, in the s. What’s more, he was the joint inventor of the Routledge and Johnson miners’ safety lamp. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, tree huggers. I can’t imagine what old Joe would say about the timidity of politicians too frightened of the eco-warriors to approve even surface mining. But I suspect it would be forthright.  There are not enough jobs in the North East to sneer at the prospect of skilled and well-paid employment. There are still pockets of mining in the Forest of Dean, where “free-miners” have a ,-year-old birthright to dig coal, ore and stone.This has so far escaped the attention of eco-disrupters, who have been much in evidence recently, protesting at the burning of woodpellets in the Drax power station inNorth Yorkshire.The fuel is made from trees felled in Mississippi which is taken to the eastern seaboard of the US, shipped to Liverpool and brought over the Pennines by train. #AxeDrax, a coalition of Extinction Rebellion and others, wants to end Drax’s “tree-burning and its train of destruction”.Ironically, the power station was visible from the pithead gear at Kellingley colliery and burnedits coal before moving on to what it calls “the largest decarbonisation project in Europe”.But you don’t have to burn the stuff to get the most out of coal. It is a key chemical feedstock. The Nazis even made petrol out of it. Scientists insist there is a future in gasication of coal, with the right investment.

The couple were spotted arriving at the castle ready for a relaxing countryside break with Eugenieaposs grandparents. Photos shared on social media show them looking happy and relaxed in casual outdoor wear, with Eugenie carrying a large orange box with a black bow. Both the Queen and Prince Philip celebrated birthdays in lockdown, so it may be a late present for their special day. The Monarch spends every summer at Balmoral, and dferent members of the family come to stay over the warmer months. Her youngest son Prince Edward and his family were among the first to visit, and were seen walking around the grounds with the Queen last week. He was joined by we Sophie and kids Louise and James, but there is a change that theyaposve now ed home as Louise picked up her GCSE results yesterday. In order to stick to social distancing rules, all royals visiting the Queen this summer will stay in separate accommodation this year rather then sleeping in the main house.  They will also make sure all their family activities are safe, and the visits are expected to feature lots of walks and outdoor time. The Queen and Philip ended months of lockdown in Windsor when they flew to Balmoral at the start of this month, and theyaposre expected to stay there until at least September. They were driven from Windsor to RAF Northolt in London this afternoon, where they then boarded a plane heading to the ,-acre Aberdeenshire estate.  The couple sat side by the side in the car, and the Queen had her trademark black handbag resting on her lap. They are joined in Scotland by whataposs been dubbed their aposBalmoral Bubbleapos, a small team of key staff who will look after them during their stay. It includes master of the household Vice-Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, the Queenaposs private secretary Sir Edward Young and Paul Whybrew and William Henderson, her pages. The Queen was living at Buckingham Palace when the pandemic began, but was whisked to Windsor before lockdown was introduced.Speaking at the time, a source said: She is in good health but it was thought best to move her. A lot of her staff are a bit panicky over coronavirus.“The Palace hosts a constant stream of visitors including politicians and dignitaries from around the world.

An outbreak linked to the Greencore Factory, which makes sandwiches for the upmarket retailer, will see staff and members of their households having to isolate for  days. The Department of Health said that local testing data and analysis from the Joint Biosecurity Centre had shown a spike in cases in the area to be almost solely down to the outbreak at the Northampton factory. The site employs , people and initially did not close its operations despite reporting dozens of cases. The department said: The factory will close voluntarily from today and employees and their direct households will be required to isolate at home for two weeks. The Health Secretary will introduce regulations to ensure that this self-isolation period is legally enforced. Anyone who leaves isolation prior to the two-week period ending without reasonable excuse will be subject to fines. The outbreak saw Northampton upgraded to an area of interventionapos due to the spike in infections. While Birmingham has a coronavirus infection rate of . per , people, Northamptonaposs rate is far higher at . as it is a much smaller place. In all intervention areas bar Northampton, possibly because the outbreak is so localised, restrictions have been imposed, while enhanced support zone councils have received more backing and mobile testing units have been dispatched. The Department of Health said Health Secretary Matt Hancock would bring in regulations to ensure that this self-isolation period is legally enforced and warned that anyone who does not abide by the rules without a reasonable excuse could be fined. Director of Public Health Northamptonshire, Lucy Wightman, told the BBC: The factory will close voluntarily. Most employees and their direct households will be required to isolate at home for two weeks.  Northamptonaposs incidence rate has hit . per , people, in the week ending  August. Mrs Wightman said the current situation is fragile in the East Midlands town. She said: If we donapost keep continuing to work together to reduce the transmission of the virus there is a very real possibility that further and stricter intervention measures and a possible local lockdown will follow. A message sent to staff at Greencore, and shared with the BBC, states the company has decided to put all colleagues working at the Northampton siteon a period of  days self-isolation.  It adds: We know this will come as concerning news for all our colleagues. We will therefore send further updates to you on the action you need to take shortly. Please stay safe. A spokesman for Greencore said the company had taken the decision to temporarily cease production at its Northampton facility from the end of today as a result of the ongoing COVID- outbreak in the Northampton area and at the site. This decision will allow all remaining colleagues at the site to self-isolate as a precautionary measure, and has been taken as part of the regionaposs ongoing efforts to reduce the spread of the virus and keep our colleagues safe.

The TV survival legend has agreed to spearhead a new drive to get hundreds more female recruits to become frontline troops in just a few months time. Grylls, , has secretly agreed his organisation Be Military Fit will join up with recruiting giant Capita to improve applicants’ fitness levels. Capita has hit recruitment targets over the past two years, but wants to help the MoD create a more gender-inclusive Army. It follows a high drop off rate in female recruits applying to join up and then either falling short on fitness or not going to basic training for other reasons. As much as  per cent of all candidates signing up to join the Army are females, after new gender inclusion rules now mean women can fight alongside male soldiers. But as many as  per cent of them have fallen slightly short on strict fitness tests which are just as gruelling as those undertaken by male candidates. This comes despite Army commanders noticing that females who do join the Army very often out -perform their male colleagues in toughness. Bear Grylls – joint owner and figurehead of BMF - told the Daily Mirror exclusively: “Be Military Fit has the military expertise, nationwide reach and a community fitness for all philosophy that ideally positions us to support Capita and the Army. “The goal is simple: to improve physical performance and readiness of potential recruits. “Our instructors and members come from a broad range of backgrounds which enables us to provide anyone who wishes to join the Army with the best possible chance of passing the Armyaposs entry standards. “Weaposre hugely proud to be part of this initiative and in collaboration with the Army and Capita we look forward to making a positive impact to our Armed Forces. “Women have proved to be some of the best recruits weaposve had lately in the Army and have proved time and time again to be just as strong as men.” "},{"url":null,"title":"student travel firm sta ceases","story":"NewsStudent travel firm STA ceases trading in UK putting hundreds of jobs at riskThe company, which has more than  stores in the UK, said it had no choice but to cease trading due to the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemicShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsSTA Travel has ceased trading, it announced this evening \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Tragic Matthew Mackell, , was found dead in a park on May . Now Matthewaposs dad Michael Bond, , says his son, who loved maths and dreamed of becoming an accountant, achieved an A in Finance, his favourite subject. Mr Bond told Kent Online: Itaposs a bittersweet feeling because Iaposm proud and I congratulated him at his grave but I just wish he was here. I donapost know about any of his other subjects yet. Matthew was in his first year of sixth form at Skinnersapos Kent Academy in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. In a note found in his school diary, the teen had expressed how lockdown made him anxious about his exam results and what it meant for his future. Mr Bond added: He was worried about his results and he was scared he was going to be in a dead-end job and he didnapost know where to go with lockdown. He lost his job too because of the virus and it all had a knock-on effect. As students across the county found out their GCSE results, Mr Bond is urging anyone who may not be happy with their marks to speak up and seek help. He added: My advice is go and sit with a teacher and talk to them because they are still there to help. Just because schools are closed doesnapost mean thereaposs no-one to talk to.

Police and paramedics went to the scene but he was pronounced dead. Mr Bond said the last time he saw Matthew was when he asked himhe wanted his room hoovered before he left to go for a walk at around pm. The Skinners Academy student said not to bother as he would do it himself when he got back but he tragically never ed home. Speaking after his sonaposs death, Mr Bond added: I just canapost believe itaposs happened. He left a message on his mobile phone screensaver saying aposHi youaposve found me. Tell my family I love them and to be there for each other. Iaposm struggling through le.apos I knew he was a popular lad to be around, always making people laugh, but Iaposve found out how strong he was. He didnapost have any problems in the world but in his mind he had too many - especially with the lockdown.

Before Mrs Mullan was taken to hospital, she went round thanking rescuers for their efforts.

Our thoughts and prayers in the first instance have to go to the we and mother of the children and to their extended family who now have to go though this grief and bury their husband and children. Itaposs horrendous.The Sinn Fein councillor added: There was very, very inclement weather at that particular time. There was very heavy rain, fairly high winds, compounded by the fact that there was an extremely high tide.He was told that waves were breaking over the sea wall onto the road.

Former Prince’s Foundation vice-chair Eileen Guggenheim, now dean of the New York Academy of Arts, is claimed by a former student to have introduced her to Epstein, who later abused her. Lawyers for Guggenheim have vehemently denied the accusations. Maria Farmer, , alleges she flew to his New Mexico ranch in  for a study trip where she was encouraged to flirt with him as he was a big NYAA donor. She claims she and her younger sister, Annie, were later abused by him and his alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell. A report by the NYAA insists Guggenheim, , played “no role” in introducing the Farmers to Epstein, concluding there was “no evidence to credibly support” her claims.  Another student who went to Epstein’s Zorro Ranch in Santa Fe in  said the young women were pressured to play games that involved “sexual objects” with Epstein and Maxwell. Guggenheim denied being present. Three ex-students confirmed the meeting, one calling it the “weirdest dinner party I’ve ever been to”. Guggenheim had denied ever being in the ranch. When Farmer, Ursula Ruedenberg, and one other went public with their claims, Guggenheim said she saw the property under construction but “did not visit any home there or have a meal there”. Her lawyers said: “Ms Farmer’s claims with regard to the ranch are inconsistent and have changed over time. “Ms Guggenheim’s visit was very brief she took a tour of the grounds with the former students and left shortly thereafter. That explains her initial failure to recollect having ever travelled to the ranch.  “It was only after seeing a photograph which depicted Ms Guggenheim, Ms Farmer, and three former students during the daylight... on the grounds, that she recalled her brief visit. She does not recall being inside any building on the property, anything out of the ordinary occurring, nor any of the students reporting an incident to her. “Ms Farmer has said she found her visit unsettling, which she has attributed to the presence of Epstein and Maxwell. Notwithstanding her explanations long after the event, in the context of how events transpired, she subsequently accepted a job with Epstein.”  Guggenheim said: “Had any student expressed to me their personal discomfort over actions by Mr Epstein I would have immediately addressed the situation and offered my support. At that time neither I nor anyone at the NYAA had any knowledge of Mr Epstein’s predatory behaviour.” Farmer claims Guggenheim “asked me to sit on his lap and flirt with him... ‘Do it for the academy, Maria’.” Guggenheim’s lawyers said: “The allegation Ms Guggenheim encouraged Ms Farmer to flirt and sit on Epstein’s knee is categorically denied and completely baseless.It is denied Ms Guggenheim had at the material time any knowledge of Ms Farmer meeting Epstein.” In a report commissioned by the NYAA, lawyer Jim Walden – who was previously the Academy and Guggenheim’s personal lawyer – found there was no evidence linking Guggenheim to any of Epstein’s abuse.

But the health chief has called on the world to unite as success depends on finding a vaccine.The Ethiopian biologist and WHO official told a briefing in Geneva: And in our situation now with more technology, and of course with more connectiveness, the virus has a better chance of spreading, it can move fast because we are more connected now. But at the same time we have also the technology to stop it and the knowledge to stop it. So we have a disadvantage of globalisation, closeness, connectedness but an advantage of better technology. So we hope to finish this pandemicless than two years. He urged national unity and global solidarity.That is really key with utilising the available tools to the maximum and hoping that we can have additional tools like vaccine.  More than . million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally and , have died, according to Reuters.Some scientists have suggested coronavirus could follow a similar pattern to the deadly Spanish flu, which swept the globe in three waves, claiming about  millions lives.It broke out in March  and mainly affected the elderly and infirm during the First World War. By August , it was hoped the pandemic was coming to an end, but the death spiked again in September to November. But the virus had developed into a new strain, and this hit young, healthy people.  The president elect of the Royal Society of Medicine Professor Roger Kirby said in July: The winter is coming and almost certainly a second wave of this virus is coming. What we saw in  was the virus change and the second wave was dferent from the first wave and it affected a dferent group of people - particularly younger people. Pandemic experts fear Covid- could go through a similar aposW curveapos as the Spanish Flu - the deadliest pandemic in history. The Spanish Flu first saw a aposU curveapos - two major spikes in deaths among the very old and very young. But this became a aposW curveapos - as death rates spiked among healthy  to -year-olds. Doctors in America are also said to fear death trends will be similar to those documented in the Spanish Flu. Dr. Raul Vasquez, CEO of the Greater Buffalo United Accountable Healthcare Network, said in July that the Spanish Flu came in three waves, with the aposU curveapos representing the first two waves.But in the final wave, the curve on the graph became a W shape as a third demographic of those aged  to -years-old saw disproportionate deaths, and not just the old or very young.  In the Spanish Flu pandemic, it was all over by the summer of . The brutal reality then was that everyone who had caught the virus had either been killed, or had developed immunity to it. While some countries have managed to reduce transmission of COVID-, Dr Tedros today warned that progress does not mean victory. He referenced several countries which had experienced new outbreaks, saying: These countries are a cautionary tale for those that are now seeing a downward trend in cases.” Much more research is needed on the impact of mutations in the coronavirus, WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said today. She said: A special working group has been formed to identy mutations ... and weaposre looking at how we can better understand what the mutation means and how they behave. India neared the million mark for coronavirus cases today, while Latin Americaaposs death toll passed , as the region reported more than , fatalities a day over the last week. The reproduction aposR rateapos number of infections in the United Kingdom has risen and may now be above , indicating a risk the overall epidemic is growing. Spainaposs equality minister has asked regions to order the closure of brothels to try to prevent new outbreaks, as daily infections rise to ,. Sweden plans to allow more spectators at cultural and sporting events. Poland reported  new cases, its highest daily increase.

Then, the day before, we had to train indoors because the undersoil heating hadn’t been switched on and I ended up breaking my leg.“I had been so high and was then so low.“My debut turned out to be against Dundee away.“I had been on the bench before and people had been saying: ‘You are going to get your debut.’#I thought: ‘Oh no, don’t say that because I will be a nervous wreck.’“I was just a wee, skinny boy“Then I got the call and we were winning - at the time.“There was then a counter-attack and they scored to make it -. I was like: ‘Oh no, I can’t concede two goals in  minutes.’“Thankfully, it finished - and after the game I was celebrating but the other lads were saying: ‘We just scraped it.’#For me, it was brilliant.”INTERVIEW: Out of favour under Robbie Neilson and out of love with football, Dundee United#s Cammy Smith has new lease of le under Micky Mellon\" title\"#INTERVIEW: Out of favour under Robbie Neilson and out of love with football, Dundee United#s Cammy Smith has new lease of le under Micky Mellon# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-cammy-smith-robbie-neilson-micky-mellon embed # secretYUfQSdqJ\" data-secret\"YUfQSdqJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It was naivety and the wrong decision at that time to leave.”Championship-winning defender Dave Rogers says departing Dundee in  for Ayr United was one of his biggest regrets of his career.The bubbly Scouser arrived at Dens Park ahead of the   season and played  times as the Dark Blues won promotion back to the big time and lted the First Division trophy.He would leave the following year, however, after an injury-hit campaign in the top flight.And the former centre-back revealed to the Walking Down The Provie Road podcast that the decision to join the Honest Men was a poor one.Rogers said: “I was offered a new contract by Dundee but I was misinformed and badly advised to go back and sign for Ayr United. I take a lot of blame myself as well.“But when I look back, it was the biggest mistake because I loved the city, loved the fans. It was naivety and the wrong decision at that time to leave.“Ayr wanted to make me captain, be their leader and get promoted, like Dundee just got promoted.“There was talk of a new stadium so there was a three-year contract with this leadership role and ambitions to get up but I was very naïve.“I listened to the wrong information and in hindsight it turned out to be the wrong decision. I don’t blame anybody, I take responsibility.”Now head coach at an ambitious American side FC Arizona, Rogers would only play  times for Ayr in Division One before a spell on loan at Partick Thistle in Division Two followed.The former Everton kid would go on to have a successful time in Ireland, winning three league titles with Shelbourne.But it’s his time at Dens Park as a -year-old he looks back on with most fondness.He said: “You’d be driving and stop at traffic lights and hear a horn go. It would be Dundee fans, showing their tattoos and everything. I love that. That’s passion. Genuine fans.“It was so rewarding to win the First Division that season and I’ll never forget the following we had at Raith Rovers that day. That’s why Dundee is still in my heart and always will be.“I look back on it and it was the best decision I made . What a squad of players and what a club to come and play for.”Described as a Dundee cult hero in some quarters, Rogers rejects that tag, saying there are more deserving ‘heroes’ for fans at Dens Park.“I’m a modest guy, I’m no cult hero for Dundee,” he added.“Bobby Cox was a legend and a hero. I remember when I signed the great man came along to training one day. Bobby came over to shake my hand and it sticks with me.“He said ‘Scouse! Welcome to the club, mate, great to have you!’ then he added ‘but you’ll never have a left foot as good as mine!’“To hear that from an actual legend, to make me feel welcome the way he did and the way everyone did, it’ll live with me forever.”And seeing the fans flock to Stark’s Park on April , , where Dundee only needed a point to clinch the First Division title with four games to spare, was one of Rogers’ best recollections in a memorable time at Dens Park.“We knew we had a squad of players capable of winning the league,” he added.“We knew the expectations, the fans and the club needed to be back in the Premier League. We knew we had what it took but we never let ourselves get carried away.“We got to Raith Rovers and only needed a point – I think the celebrations went on for four days after that! It was phenomenal and great memories.“We saw the support that day and were thinking to ourselves ‘let’s put it to bed, do it today’ after seeing the support behind the goal.“We got the point and sent everybody back over the Tay Bridge celebrating. It was an unbelievable experience.”Rogers found the net just once in his time in dark blue but he admits the penalty to win against Airdrie in October proved costly – and not just because he did his hamstring.“There was a little bit of rivalry between Airdrie and ourselves.“We got the penalty in the rd minute, I slotted it in and went running round the dog track towards all the fans and my hamstring went!“To kill a bit of time, Cowboytook me off. Walking past their bench, there was a bit of mouthing and me, being a Scouser, mouthed back at them.“In the altercation, I tripped over by accident and after the game I naively said Big Doddystuck his leg out and tried to trip me up.“It was tongue-in-cheek but the next day I’m all over the back of the newspapers! Alex McDonald was brilliant, he accepted my apology.“It was a lesson learned – keep the mouth shut next time and you won’t be fined four weeks wages!”Despite a change of manager from McCormack to Jocky Scott, the camaraderie among the players that season drove the club on.Rogers said: “The team spirit was phenomenal. It’s the best club, the best team spirit and the best squad of players I’ve ever been involved with.“I’ll never forget when big Rab Douglas signed – I thought we’d signed Ivan Drago from Rocky!“Rab was a phenomenal goalkeeper, his shot-stopping was amazing and to have a presence like that behind you as a defender is a relief at times.“You knowyou are under the cosh, the big fella was there.“You had Barry Smith, a great leader, and Brian Irvine at the back, Maddygetting up and down the left and not to forget the Cobra, the mad fellaAdamczuk would catch pigeons up and down the right-hand side.“Then there was Iain Anderson, a game-changer, Darren Magee in midfield with Jimmy McInally and Eddie Annand. We had a quality squad.”Now a highly-qualied coach, Rogers has travelled the globe since his playing days ended in , having coached in the Liverpool International Football Academy in Europe, India and South Korea as well as being assistant manager to the Indian national side.Now in Arizona, the -year-old is keen to continue learning his trade and has ambitions to manage back in the UK.Asked whether that might be at Dundee, Rogers replied: “Never say never! The manager James McPake is doing a great job and I hope the fans get behind him.“It’s tough times and like what happened with Barry Smith, I know the fans will get behind him.“One day I do have aspirations of being manager at highest level.“Would I love to come back to Scotland or the UK as a manager  Absolutely, but only for the right club.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Of those,  were in the NHS Grampian area, compared with  in Tayside,  in Greater Glasgow and Clyde and four in Lanarkshire. No new deaths had been recorded in the last  hours.At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon described the position in Aberdeen as “an improving situation” and said there was “no evidence” of transmission into Aberdeenshire or Moray.Ms Sturgeon said that when the local lockdown is reviewed on Sunday, the government would look at bringing Aberdeen into line with the rest of the country on some aspects of coronavirus policy, such as casinos and bingo halls reopening.We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”Nicola SturgeonElsewhere in Scotland, such venues are scheduled to come back into use on Monday. Previously, Ms Sturgeon has indicated that she would look at reopening Aberdeen’s non-licensed cafes on Wednesday.“On Sunday… we will review the lockdown restrictions in Aberdeen again,” Ms Sturgeon said. “And at that time we hope that we will be able to set out a firm timetable for the lting of these restrictions.“At that point we will also set out whether some of the changes that were announced more generally for the country yesterday – for example, the reopening of venues like bingo halls – will also apply in Aberdeen.”She added: “We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”The first minister added that there was “no evidence to suggest there had been wider transmission” beyond the city of Aberdeen.“That is something that has been looked at very carefully, particularly around Aberdeenshire, particularly given some of the travel patterns and proximity of communities there,” the first minister said.Ms Sturgeon said the cluster associated with those who gathered in the city’s pubs was now under control. But there was an “ongoing concern” about cases not associated with the cluster, but things were improving. In total,  cases have been identied in the Grampian Health Board area since the July .Of those,  were associated with the pub-linked cluster, and , contacts have been identied from those  cases. In the last  hours, there had been an additional seven cases not associated with the original cluster.Earlier this week Aberdeen City Council leaders expressed frustration that the city had not been allowed out of its three week lockdown earlier, warning that , jobs were at risk as a result of the coronavirus.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing said: “Of course we have to be mindful of public health, but we also have to be mindful of the economic implications, which could have an impact on public health as well.#It is about balancing competing harms. Economic damage could harm public health through unemployment and poverty. That’s why we thought, in line with the incident management team, that restrictions on travel, household gatherings and hospitality could have been lted earlier.”At her briefing, Ms Sturgeon repeated her warnings about house parties, saying indoor social gatherings were proving one of the major drivers of community transmission of the virus.She said: “That tells us that we need to be incredibly cautious about these kinds of gatherings.“I want to ask everybody again today to remember the advice that is in place and to comply with it.”Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop repeated her plea for the UK Government#s furlough scheme to be extended, particularly in the hospitality and tourism industries.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We are therefore taking the precaution at this time of advising that all staff self isolate for  days from the date they were last on site.“Additionally, we ask all pupils and their households to self isolate for  days from Thursday, August . Guidance has also been shared with the families on what this means for them and how they will be supported.”Paul Clancy, Dundee City Council executive director of children and families services, said: “I would like to reassure families that this action is being taken to keep everyone safe.

He did that.The players have been sanctioned with fines by the club and are awaiting the outcome of a disciplinary hearing next Friday having been served with notices of complaint by the SFA. They could yet be hammered by the SFA with bans of two to eight games.There is no point punishing the club and supporters by dropping them in a game where Aberdeen desperately needed to secure the first points of the season.New signing Ross McCrorie showed his versatility on the right of a back three.The -year-old played at right-back on loan at Portsmouth last season.Prior to that he played in Rangers’ first team in central midfield.This was McCrorie’s first game since the play-off semi-final with Portsmouth on July . There were no signs of ring rust.It was a solid debut in defence, where he was composed and cool in and out of possession.Similarly impressive was new signing Tommie Hoban, who made a welcometo the Dons starting line-up after  months of injury hell.Hoban played on the left of the back three.This was the former Watford defender’s first competitive game time since suffering cruciate ligament damage while on loan at Aberdeen against St Mirren in February .For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges. P  pupils Ross Potter-Irwin and Henry Small should get their Bikeability badges in term time next year.Through partnership with the Ardrishaig Bothy, Cycling Scotland is offering schools free instructor support, instructor training and resources to deliver Bikeability Scotland training.Bikeability Scotland is the national cycle training programme designed to give children the skills and confidence they need to cycle safely on the roads and to encourage them to carry on cycling into adulthood.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.,params: .pushPlants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way.

councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles.

This will be particularly important post-Covid when the area is likely to be suffering alongside many others from store closures and reduced footfall.ldquoOn the subject of the introduction of a mph zone for the town, this too is to be welcomed.

E-bikes offer a greater mileage for commuting with less physical effort required and a safer means of physical distancing.ldquoE-bike public hire stations, which will be managed by another company, will be installed in Musselburgh at the Brunton Hall and next to Musselburgh Train Station in autumn.ldquoE-bike hire areas in other towns across East Lothian are proposed. In addition, discussions are ongoing with local bike shop businesses as to how they can support the public hire scheme.Public Bike Shareschemes have been introduced across the world, with many using docks which lock the bicycles in and release them for a small fee or with use of a card to users however, their success in the UK has been limited, with vandalism a major concern.In London, Santander Cycles operates a successful scheme which has spread to Swansea and Milton Keynes, with users issued a key to access the bicycles, which cost pound and allow free use for the first  minutes and then charge pound for every additional  minutes.East Lothian Council said that as well as Musselburgh, there were plans to have public hire stations for e-bikes in Haddington town centre and at Prestonpans Railway Station, Longniddry Railway Station, Memorial Square in Prestonpans, Civic Square in Tranent and Memorial Park in Cockenzie, each of which would have capacity for eight bikes.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskill described the changes as ldquoreclaiming the streets.He said: ldquoThis is a challenge but equally an opportunity, offering other public health improvements, as well as the required social distancing. Reducing air pollution and promoting walking and cycling will have benefits for us all. Providing adequate car parking remains essential, with vehicular access understandably restricted. Itrsquos not easy but it can be done. As communities on the continent have discovered, people reclaiming their streets has benefits for all.Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said: ldquoThe substantial increase in the number of people walking and cycling, both locally and across the UK, was one of the positive unintended consequences of lockdown.ldquoThis clearly brings benefits for both the health of the iniduals doing more walking and cycling, and for the environmentit means fewer vehicles on our roads.ldquoTherefore, I welcome measures to encourage and support the continuation of this growth in walking and cycling as we move out of lockdown.ldquoHowever, changes must be designed and implemented with ongoing consultation with the local communities affected.In a report to councillors, Peter Forsyth, the councilrsquos assets manager, revealed ambitions to make the most of the side effects of lockdown.He said: ldquoThe Covid- shutdown has resulted in less air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions primarily due to extensive travel restrictions. Other positive impacts have included reduced energy consumption, and increased walking and cycling. Accordingly, there are opportunities for a lsquoGreen Recoveryrsquo, adapting to new ways of working with increased changes to travel behaviour all in support to the transition to a low carbon economy and low carbon lestyles for the longer term that will enable us to continue to tackle the climate emergency.A council spokesperson said: ldquoAs part of Spaces for People, we are proposing the installation of e-bikes in suitable locations. E-bikes are becoming increasingly popular as an active travel option which could be potentially attractive as an alternative form of clean, green transportation.

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves.

Baa-lambs wonrsquot ever hurt us, will they Isla and George French from Cornhill, Aberdeenshire, one of six families featured in the series, clearly missed the memo about sticking with what you know, animal-wise. They had opted for emus, ostriches, deer, and, just for old timersquos sake, some belted Galloway cows.Oh, and they had three children under five and dad worked full-time as well as helping on the farm. Whatever  it was, this farming le was not for slackers.Now in its fourth series, This Farming Le keeps things simple, following families through a single year. The viewer has the advantage in that they know what is coming. The new series, beautully shot as ever, started in autumn  and everyone was worried about the looming Brexit. Little did they know something far worse than added bureaucracy was coming down the pipe.In Armadale, Joyce Campbell was concerned what price she would get for her lambs at market. She needed pound, and in the end made pound,. The scenes at auction, and at the market in Aberdeen where Isla and George French set up shop to sell their meat, were a reminder that farming is a business like any other and farms are not petting zoos.There were, however, clear bonds between the farmers and their animals. It was sad to see the animals go, said Joycersquos nephew, but there was the money to look forward to. ldquoDetermines how good a Christmas present Irsquom going to get. Joyce admitted to having a lump in her throat when the lambs went. ldquoYou wouldnrsquot be humanyou didnrsquot.The other two families introduced last night were hill farmers from the Lake District , and a couple with a baby from Morpeth, Northumberland.The latter had cows but their real money was made from breeding and training collies. One dog sold recently for close to pound,.Everything came down to money in the end. As the year rolls on and You Know What arrives, that will become even more so.For now, as the farmers headed into winter, the tone was hopeful, plans were being made to move to bigger, better premises, and branch out into this or that new scheme. But there will be no escaping the bleak times to come.All the more reason to enjoy what was happening now. One of Isla Frenchrsquos many jobs was watching over ostrich chicks while they hatched. When one beak pierced a shell she jumped, thinking someone had fired a bullet.She was worried about one that was taking too long to emerge. A lack of oxygen does for most chicks. She had a peer inside and spoke words of encouragement.ldquoKeep chipping away little chicks, she told the trio, ldquothatrsquos what lersquos about. It was quietly magical, miraculous even.

Was it a Gavin Williamson or b John Swinney You get where Irsquom going with this, donrsquot you  The answer to all the questions is: it doesnrsquot matter because they are interchangeable. On the question of the initial results, both Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson defended them at first. Ms Sturgeon said they were ldquocredible Mr Johnson said they were ldquorobust.This was then followed by remarkably similar protests from pupils. In Scotland, they held up placards that said ldquoI am not a postcode. In England they held up placards that said ldquoI am not a postcode.Then came the apologies. Mr Swinney said: ldquoWe now accept that the risk of undermining the value of qualications is outweighed by a concern that young people, particularly from working class backgrounds, may lose faith in education. Mr Williamson said: ldquoIt became increasingly apparent that there were too many young people that quite simply hadnt got the grade they truly deserved.\"Some people say the two situations are dferent they say the UK Government should have seen what was coming because of the fiasco in Scotland and I understand that to an extent. But to suggest that the Scottish Government handled the situation well and the UK Governmentrsquos approach was chaos is misleading. Look at the trajectories Irsquove outlined above: theyrsquore the same.The dference is our reaction. When the fiasco first hit in England and the Tories stood by the exam results, I was texted by a colleague of mine who insisted on voting Yes in  despite me telling him not to. His text contrasted the responses of the Tories and the SNP. The SNP, he said, admitted they screwed up, whereas the Tories dug their heels in. There was similar reaction on Twitter: ldquoat least the SNP had the grace to accept they were wrong and apologise.So when the Tories also apologised I texted my colleague back. Presumably, I asked him pompously, you now have the same respect for the Tory U-turn as you had for the SNP one  ldquoBetter late than never, he replied. ldquoBut they dragged their feet for days hellip and its yet another U-turn. They are very good at them, arent they I know a lot of you will agree with my colleague, but itrsquos me whorsquos writing this column, not him, so I get the last word and itrsquos this: the Tory apology in England reveals how biased we are in Scotland. If we trust someone ndash and a lot of people in Scotland trust the SNP ndashwersquore willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and accept their apology. Equally,we do not like someone ndash and a lot of people in Scotland do not like the Tories ndash wersquore more likely to judge them and dismiss their apology as too little too late.The word for all of this is bias and thatrsquos fine in a way because wersquore all guilty of it ndash we are all more likely to react to people rather than facts. But bias operates even when the facts are the same: I refer you the facts outlined above ndash they are the same. Some people may say the bias towards the SNP is well founded: theyrsquove governed Scotland well. They may also say the bias against the Tories is well-founded: look at their record.

The leader of its family policy unit is Cristina Odone, former editor of The Catholic Herald. As such its , among others, is to shore up classic Conservative family values, at the heart of which is marriage. Sadly, the present Prime Minister seems not to have received the memo.Setting aside for the moment the religious and political leanings of those behind this report, its conclusions show the stark and widening gulf between the married well-off and the unmarried poor. Medicine has long recognised the advantages ndash especially to men ndash of tying the knot, but the CSJrsquos findings focus on the enormous benefit that marriage bestows not on the couple, but on their children.Despite being lauded by David Cameron as ldquoa great institution, few subjects have been more ripe for ridicule. The butt of stand-ups down the ages, matrimony is the gag that never stops giving. It can be plumbed endlessly for laughs by the cynical, the wry, the embittered and the romantic. Yet the conclusions of the Centre for Social Justicersquos report are anything but funny.Their statistics show that those on low incomes are far less keen to wed than the wealthy. Once children are born, cohabiting parents are almost four times more likely to separate before a child is five than married parents. The health and educational attainment of children with broken family backgrounds are worse, and their likelihood of having a criminal conviction by the age of  doublestheir parents separated before they were five.These statistics certainly cast matrimony in a starkly black and white light. And it gets worse. The middle classes are not only more likely to marry, but % of high earners do so, compared to % of the poorest. If a straight line can be drawn between cohabitation and unstable family relationships, that is bad news for youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds. Butmarriage truly is the key factor in this downward trajectory,a set of vows and a certicate and a wedding video is the glue that holds the middle classes together, then that is a whole other issue. Suddenly a custom that previously was prevalent across the classes is in danger of becoming a status symbol. Marriage, by this calculation, is synonymous with money.I grew up in the wake of the Beatles and the moon landing, when walking down the aisle was no longer essential, evenyou hoped to have children. Nevertheless the stigma of cohabiting, or becoming parents before you wore a wedding ring, took a long time to fade. When finally it became commonplace society grew more civilised, acknowledging that couples didnrsquot require an official document to take themselves, and be taken, seriously. Cohabiting was no more a byword for casual than marrying was for happy. Yet now, it is deemed a red flag for social disadvantage.The direct correlation between marriage and class suggests that money is at least part of the explanation. Those who are strapped for cash either consider it irrelevant, or not for the likes of them. And the more it is perceived to be for the better off, the less it will appeal to people further down the social spectrum.You canrsquot help wonderingthe wedding industry, as opposed to marriage itself, has created expectations that the hard-up simply cannot meet. With the average Scottish wedding now costing over a staggering pound,, this comes as no surprise. Increasingly the concept of marrying is bound up with the wedding. The status of the couple and their families is proclaimed by the nature of the ceremony, the wedding venue, and the sumptuousness of the reception. Not to mention stag and hen weekends and parties beforehand.It takes at least a year, and usually a lot longer, to book, plan and save for the big day. Ultimately, though, what matters is not the trappings, but making the vows, whether in a religious setting, or a registry office. The seriousness of the bond lies in the couplersquos decision to commit to each other, not in any of the hoopla that follows. Perhaps it is time to separate the legal procedure from the carnival that follows, to consciously uncouple the act of union from this crippling cost.Yet the nub of the problem identied by CSJ is not marriage itself, but hardship. Those living on the bread line do not have the resources, and possibly donrsquot have the inclination, to get officially tied. Given the serious disadvantages suffered when they separate, the answer, surely, is not to coax iniduals into wedlock, asit were the panacea for all their ails, but to digny cohabiting couples and their offspring with the same legal safeguards and tax breaks as those who marry. Protecting the rights of children and parents ndash especially mothers, who commonly look after the kids once a relationship ends ndash would give them a financial safety-net. Many of the outcomes for youngsters described in this report ndash gang membership, criminality, mental and physical health issues ndash are as much the result of penury as the lack of a piece of paper supposedly binding their parents forever.If it is to retain its meaning, marriage has to be a personal choice, not a virtuous act that deserves a reward. It can be done cheaply and quietly, as I can testy, or with terric fanfare, or it can be avoided altogether. Either way, in an enlightened world those in long-term relationships, and couples with children, should be treated by government in exactly the same way as the married. Until that day ndash far off, I fear ndash the gulf between the haves and the have nots will steadily deepen, eroded by a judgemental, moralising and, as wersquove too often seen, hypocritical state.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Tory commentators and many MPs are deeply dischuffed with Mr Johnson, and not just because his Government made an even worse cock-up of the exams than the Scottish Government. Negotiations resumed this week over the withdrawal agreement with the European Union, and it is safe to say that expectations among the Conservative faithful are not high.Indeed, Brexiter Tory MPs, like Iain Duncan Smith, fully expect a sell-out. They think Mr Johnson is preparing to accept a whole range of EU regulations even after we have left. This means no trade deals with free market America, no state aid to key industries, no low tax havens and a ldquobetrayal of fishing.Tory MPs hoped that Boris would be tough on immigration, would cut taxes and rein back bureaucracy, while tackling political correctness and the nanny state. What they got was a bicycling PM who seems to be tough on motorists, not illegals. He has adopted what the Spectator columnist Christopher Snowden, calls ldquopurse-lipped, micro-managing, finger-wagging, lemon-sucking, censorious, anti-business, killjoy policies like the campaigns on obesity and sugar.Not in their wildest dreams did true blue Tories expect their chosen one to increase public spending by more than any Labour government since . Yet, this Government is currently paying the wages of half the working population through furlough, benefits and public sector employment. UK debt is now pound trillion. Thank God Margaret Thatcher is not alive to see it.Mr Johnson hasnrsquot even delivered on scrapping HS, the fast rail line that most Tory MPs think is a white elephant. Instead, he is fantasising about building bridges between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Yet that is not going to keep the Union together. His Brexit deal, it is now clear, has created a gulf between the UK and Northern Ireland.The province has remained in regulatory alignment with the European Unionrsquos single market, which means that there must be the very border checks the PM promised would never happen. Worse, it has handed the SNP a genuine grievance: being denied access to markets with which Northern Ireland can trade seamlessly.Tories are appalled by Mr Johnsonrsquos lack of urgency on Scotland as support for independence grows. The former Tory leader, William Hague, said this week thatthe PM doesnrsquot get his act together the UK will be finished within five years. Tories like Mr Hague think he allowed Nicola Sturgeon to play politics with the coronavirus.What they didnrsquot anticipate was the cack-handed and contradictory approach taken by the UK Government. At first, the lockdown seemed to appeal to the British wartime spirit, which always goes down well on the Right. But far from winning a victory over this viral enemy, Britain has recorded the worst excess death rate in Europe and now the deepest recession.Most Conservatives loath the imposition of masks, which the Daily Mail commentator, Peter Hitchens, calls ldquomuzzles, and which libertarians think are pointless impediments. Many Tory voters spend their holidays in France and the letters columns are full of people complaining about being forced back to Blighty even from regions of France where Covid is almost non-existent.Yet this Conservative Government kept Britainrsquos airports open during the worst phase of the pandemic, allowing  million travellers to come to Britain largely unchecked, including a number from Covid hot spots like Italy and China. And donrsquot even mention track and trace.The exams debacle was the final straw. Tory MPs want the head of the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, on a plate for his chaotic U-turn, but the real criticism is of the Prime Minister. He should surely have seen this coming after the chaos in Scotland. It seems to many asMr Johnson isnrsquot really in charge.His presentation has been lamentable, and even is greatest fans are disappointed with his bumbling delivery and lack of grip. He was never a detail man, and everyone knew he flew by the seat of his pants ndash thatrsquos when he managed to keep them on.Conservatives are pretty forgiving to politicians who think like they do, have the same instincts on nation and values. What is especially damaging is a growing sense that Mr Johnson is just not really a Conservative at all. They expected him to take a tough line with the statue topplers and culture warriors of Black Lives Matters. But instead of banging heads, he avoided confrontation and made only a routine condemnation of vandalism. He allowed Winston Churchill himself to be boxed up in Parliament Square. How could it come to this Part of the problem, I think, is that many Conservatives believed what Labour said about Mr Johnson ndash that he was a bit of a racist, misogynist, homophobic right winger. The most ldquoright-wing prime minister in British history as Labourrsquos John Mc Donnell called him. This he never was.Colourful phrases about Burqa-wearers looking like letter boxes does not a white supremacist make. When he was London mayor, he was careful to keep the black and ethnic community onside and he used to lead LGBT marches wearing a pink stetson. When he became PM he installed more BAME ministers than all previous UK governments combined. You wont hear Mr Johnson using Daily Mail rhetoric about immigrants, he genuinely believes in state intervention and he is quietly a bit of a Europhile. Far from being a free market ideologue, Boris Johnson is a liberal, patrician Tory ndash more like Michael Heseltine, Brexit aside, than Margaret Thatcher.The final insult was this Tory Prime Minister ennobling Claire Fox, a former Revolutionary Communist who used to support the objectives of the IRA. That was the final straw.

I mean, Irsquom a woman who takes an hour to decide what to watch on Netflix, who stares in food-envy at fellow-dinersrsquo meal choices in restaurants, and who, more than once, has been told to remove my rose-tinted specs.Whilst it does look as though countries with female leaders, on the whole, were quicker to lock-down and have been more risk averse when it comes to peoplersquos lives ndash Germany, New Zealand, and Taiwan come to mind as having had far fewer Covid deaths than male-led countries such as the US, Brazil, UK or India, it doesnrsquot explain male-led countries like Greece, for example where Covid deaths remained relatively low.Who can forget Boris Johnsonrsquos ill-fated declaration that hersquod been to a hospital where there were coronavirus patients and he had shaken everyonersquos hand. In the Philippines, which had one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in south east Asia, President Duterte told police and military to take matters into their own hands when dealing with lockdown breakers: ldquoShoot them dead...Do you understand  Dead. None of these are words we could imagine tumbling from current women leadersrsquo mouths.Instead, women like Jacinda Ardern, Angela Merkel and, latterly, after an arguable initial hesitancy, Nicola Sturgeon, have taken a more active listening approach. Taking advice from experts, collaborating with colleagues and, importantly, keeping the ego firmly in check, these leaders were honest and clear from the start. Whilst many world leaders were playing the threat down, Merkel told Germans that % of the population might be affected and that it would be Germanyrsquos biggest challenge since the Second World War.Ardernrsquos early motto was: ldquoWe must go hard and we must go early. In January, in Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-Wen introduced strict travel restrictions and quarantine controls for passengers entering from high-risk areas, resulting in just under  deaths in a country of nearly  million. But despite my strong impulse to declare womanhood to be the reason for this, the truth is maybe a little more prosaic. Perhaps being women simply predisposes them to having certain qualities required for good leadership ndash strong communication skills, empathy, honesty and trust. The aforementioned men are just sadly lacking in those.Leaders who were more risk averse at the thought of many deaths and who therefore took decisions to shut down whole economies will now be tested as economies begin to open up again. The criticism is that they have not been risk averse when it comes to the damage they have done to their economies.But it looks like the gamble to close down hard and fast in the hope that less damage might be done to the economy might just pay off. Germanyrsquos economy appears to be recovering and schemes like the Kurzarbeit programme, which allows workers to work reduced hours instead of being laid off, is expected to be extended by Merkel for  months to bring stability for workers, which the end of the UKs furlough scheme may not.In Scotland, Sturgeon is calling for furloughing to be extended, whilst clamping down on clusters of the virus and rule-breakers like a tough headmistress. In New Zealand, a quick economic recovery has been put on hold by Arden as she locks down again to eliminate, rather than simply contain, the virus.

Instead, Mr Biden spoke to a largely empty arena near his Delaware home.Afterwards, fireworks lit the sky outside the arena where supporters waited in a car park, honking horns and flashing headlights in a moment that finally lent a jovial feel to the event.The keynote address was the speech of a letime for Biden, who would be the oldest president ever electedhe defeats Donald Trump in November.Mr Trump, who is , publicly doubts Bidens mental capacity and calls him \"Slow Joe\", but with the nation watching, he was firm and clear.Still, the convention leaned on a younger generation earlier in the night to help energise his sprawling coalition.Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois senator who lost both legs in Iraq and is raising two young children, said Mr Biden has \"common decency\".Cory Booker, only the ninth African American senator in US history, said Mr Biden believes in the dignity of all working Americans.And Pete Buttigieg, a -year-old former mayor and a gay military veteran, noted that Mr Biden came out in favour of same-sex marriage as vice president even before former president Barack Obama.\"Joe Biden is right, this is a contest for the soul of the nation. And to me that contest is not between good Americans and evil Americans,\" Mr Buttigieg said.\"Its the struggle to call out what is good for every American.\"Above all, Mr Biden focused on uniting the nation as Americans grapple with the long and fearful health crisis, the related economic devastation, a national awakening on racial justice - and Mr Trump, who stirs heated emotions from all sides.Mr Bidens positive focus Thursday night marked a break from the dire warnings offered by Mr Obama and others the night before.The th president of the United States warned that American democracy itself could falterMr Trump is re-elected, while Mr Bidens running mate, Kamala Harris, the -year-old Calornia senator and daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, warned that Americans lives and livelihoods were at risk.Mr Bidens Democratic Party has sought this week to put forward a cohesive vision of values and policy priorities, highlighting efforts to combat climate change, tighten gun laws and embrace a humane immigration policy.They have drawn a sharp contrast with Mr Trumps policies and personality, portraying him as cruel, self-centred and woefully unprepared to manage virtually any of the nations mounting crises and policy challenges.Mr Bidens call for unity comes as some strategists worry that Democrats cannot retake the White House simply by tearing Mr Trump down, that Mr Biden needs to give his sprawling coalition something to vote for.Though he has been in the public spotlight for decades as a Delaware senator, much of the electorate knows little about Mr Bidens background before he began serving as Mr Obamas vice president in .Thursdays convention served as a national reintroduction of sorts that drew on some of the most painful moments of his le.\"I know how mean and cruel and unfair le can be sometimes,\" Mr Biden said.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

have trusted the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

Brian, however, is determined that it will still be a challenge for anyone who wants to get involved.“Because of restrictions we’ve had to chop the route it half – but don’t worry we’ve left the hard half for people so it’s still going to be a challenge over the hills. “We should all be in to Ballycastle about :pm.”NI Community Fundraising Relationship Manager Gary Wilson says: Over the past five years Brian has raised over pound, for Guide Dogs, and I am so thankful he and the community of St Marys GAC in Rasharkin have found a way to keep it going.Brian is excited to get going, and has been preparing for months now, with a Virtual Lap of Ireland under his belt. “My cousin and Ihave been practicing every Sunday – sometimes up to  miles and we’ve been getting help from The Training Hub Cloughmills, who can’t do enough for us. “They’ve taken us under their wing with a bit of personal training before the big walk so we can’t thank them enough.”If you would like to support Brian’s walk and the work Guide Dogs do, you can make a donation on JustGiving at  bit.ly TheDocsBigWalk "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3302507.jpg--.jpg?1597936414000\n","title":"cranswick covid cases force closure for deep clean","story":"A Cullybackey meat processing plant has been closed because of Covid- cases amongst employees.Cranswick,a pig processing plant is to shut for a deep clean and for the testing of staff.The company briefed its workers on Thursday afternoon, with the closure taking effect from : BST on Saturday.A company spokesman declined to confirm how many of its  staff were involved in the current outbreak, but said staff welfare was the primary concern.There has been a recent increase in the number of confirmed Covid- cases in Ballymena and the wider region and this has been acknowledged as a community issue.As a result of this, we can confirm that a number of colleagues at our Ballymena site have tested positive for Covid-.Working with the Public Health Authority , we have taken the decision to send all of our colleagues for testing.

With another  cases confirmed yesterday, that is  in just four days.On Saturday the Republic#s health authorities announced  cases there.The UK and Irish Republic have already begun to impose localised lockdowns in areas with high cases of the virus. Yesterday Stormont#s chief scientic adviser said the same approach could be taken here.Suddenly the outlook is a lot less optimistic than it had appeared.In May the Executive introduced its five-stage plan for exiting the lockdown. While many restrictions have been lted, some - including the reopening of wet pubs - have still to be acted on, amid lingering concerns of a second wave.The road map:On May  the Executive published its five-stage recovery strategy.Included in the first step of the plan were proposals for groups of four to six people to meet outside, churches to be permitted to open for private prayer, outdoor sports including golf and tennis to resume and more people encouraged toto work. Garden centres and large outdoor retailers were also permitted to reopen.In step two, up to  people could meet outdoors, while two to four people could meet indoors for short periods. Sports training would be allowed to resume and non-food retailers would be allowed to reopen.Step three would enable up to  people to meet outdoors along with the reopening of museums and galleries, with theatre rehearsals allowed to resume. Large indoor gatherings would be authorised, while the phasedof office working would be encouraged. Children were also set toto school on a part-time basis.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBishop of Down and Connor, Noel Treanor celebrates Mass under strict social distancing in St Peter’s Cathedral, west Belfast this morning.

Masks are also mandatory on public transport - although again enforcement is largely non-existent - and will be strongly encouraged for activities involving large numbers of staff or pupils in an enclosed space.Expert#s views:Queen#s University Belfastvirologist Dr Connor Bamford said that he believed Northern Ireland#s coronavirus lockdown had been successful.He said that the virus had been slowed down with cases being reported in single and double digits most days.However, while lockdown had worked well, he believes the virus was always present in Northern Ireland.We were always detecting cases and we were always seeing small clusters that would pop up in dferent parts of the country, he said.Dr Bamford said it was anticipated that, as restrictions were relaxed, cases would rise because the virus was present and most people remained susceptible. He said contact tracing had played a key role in identying new cases and clusters in Northern Ireland.The virologist, who emerged as one of Northern Ireland#s experts on the virus, said a dynamic approach was needed to deal with the virus going forward.We#re not out of the woods yet, certainly we would like to be able to reduce restrictions safely, but then we might have to bring in more restrictions as has been seen in other parts of the UK, Dr Bamford said.I would imagine nothing is off the table, we could be looking at lockdowns by city, or county or even given the size of Northern Ireland they may just decide to lockdown the entire country, it will depend purely on the circumstances surrounding the outbreak.Dr Bamford said the virus seemed to now be affecting more younger people as they were taking more risks as lockdown eased.We just can#t go back completely to normal until we have a very good vaccine, he said.We have to think of it as the #new normal#, it isn#t going to be forever, there will be a time when we won#t worry about Covid, but until then this is what the new normal has to be.However the virologist said he didn#t believe we were seeing the beginning of a second wave of the virus.I wouldn#t say that at this stage, but you#ll see with things like schools going back or large changes to lockdown, they all might sort of come together and you might see something that looks like the beginning of a second wave or a large outbreak, he said.Read More New lockdown restrictions comingCovid- cases continue to rise in Northern Ireland - Swann NI close to needing localised Covid restrictions, warns Prof Ian YoungDr Bamford praised the Executive#s fluid approach to managing the pandemic. However, he believes a policy of eradicating the virus should be pursued.I think more could be done to get rid of the virus in Northern Ireland and then it might be safer to reopen schools, he said.At the minute we#re all sort of responding to outbreaks, what happenswe really went after the virus and eradicated the virus from the country I think there#s a lot to be said about that because then you might not have to make the choice between opening schools or pubs.You need to find where that virus is and really go after it with more testing, community testing, but we#re not really doing that and we#re more managing the outbreaks.

Guidelines were very clear. It goes against public health advice.” He called for further resignations from all political representatives who attended the event.Read MoreEilis O’Hanlon:Opinion Sinn Fein shows no shame in demanding resignations after Irish government golf row His comments come less than two months after Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O’Neill and Finance Minister Conor Murphy were criticised over claims they breached coronavirus guidelines at the funeral of veteran IRA man Bobby Storey.Speaking to RTE, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said the Irish government “has descended into new levels of chaos”. But when asked about party members who came under criticism for attending Mr Storey’s funeral in June, Ms McDonald said she does not think there is an equivalence between a funeral and a “golfing shindig”.Earlier, DUP MP Carla Lockhart said Mr Cullinane’s comments show that Sinn Fein is “certainly a partitionist party when it comes to irony”.“Sinn Fein’s demands on Irish government ministers to resign for breach of Covid- guidelines begs the question why two dferent standards by the same party in two dferent countries  If ministers who breach the rules must resign there why not here ” she added. “True to form, Sinn Fein brazenly ignored the public outcry at the double standards and demands for resignations.”TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Northern Ireland has been reminded by Mr Cullinane that when it comes to his party it is a case of do as we say not as we do.”Former Fine Gael MEP and Alliance leader John Cushnahan said Sinn Fein has “no right whatsoever” to condemn those politicians who attended the golf dinner.SDLP MLA Colin McGrath questioned whether David Cullinane’s comments represent a Sinn Fein policy that “doesn’t apply across the border”.Dara Calleary’s resignation comes just  days into his role as Agriculture Minister, a position to which he was appointed to after Taoiseach Micheal Martin sacked his predecessor Barry Cowen amid controversy over a drink-driving offence.Last night Ireland’s acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said it is “very clear” that the event held in Galway was not in line with public health guidance.Current guidelines state that no more than  people should gather indoors in the Republic.Dr Glynn said: “There’s a very justiable and understandable anger in Ireland today. It’s not misplaced.”Speaking to RTE, Taoiseach Micheal Martin denied his leadership had been damaged.He said the Mr Calleary had paid a “terrible price” but had done the right thing in resigning.Ireland’s Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said what happened was “wrong an inexcusable”.He added: “There are people all over this country who have made huge sacrices and who continue to make huge sacrices and at a minimum, the Irish people need to see those rules followed by members of the Oireachtas.”Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fee-fbf-aa--dbbd_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandIrish agriculture minister resigns after attending golf eventIrish Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary has resigned after attending an indoor golf society event with  other people.News PremiumBobby Storey funeral: Unionists aim to keep pressure on Sinn Fein#s Michelle O#NeillUnionists are aiming to keep pressure on Sinn Fein over the funeral of Bobby Storey more than a month after the row began.GalleryCoronavirusConfusion over Executive rules on foreign trips as MLA cancels holiday to Italy after backlashStormont has been thrown into confusion over its Covid- holiday rules after an MLA sparked controversy by saying she#d be taking a family break to Italy - only to cancel it after she came in for criticism.Northern IrelandSinn Fein abused society with funeral attendance – BeattieSinn Fein leaders abused wider society in Northern Ireland by flouting coronavirus rules at Bobby Storey’s funeral, the Assembly has been told.Most ReadBelfast woman jailed for bus journey during quarantine on Isle of Man visitMoville businessman John Mullan and his two children die in tragic Donegal road accidentCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: No new deaths and  cases of Covid- reportedRUC man#s cold-blooded killing in  subject of top journalist#s new bookNew pictures emerge of The Northman film set starring Nicole Kidman and Skarsgård brothers,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The ruling came in legal challenges by two victims - including Jenner McNern,- to the continued impasse around introducing the scheme with an estimated cost of £mAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThey lost legs, arms or their eyesight, but the victims who gathered outside Belfast High Court never lost heart.Yesterday, their long and exhausting years of struggle finally paid off as a judge declared that The Executive Office had unlawfully refused to advance their pension scheme.Justice McAlinden delivered a scathing ruling that surely made Sinn Fein squirm.Every legal argument advanced on behalf of Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was demolished.Arrant nonsense, a truly shocking proposition, wilful disregard for the rule of law, or abject ignorance of whatmeans in a democratic society were just some of the terms used.How on earth did the party get it legally, politically and morally so wrong  Why fight a battle that you#re destined to lose in both a court of law and the court of public opinion  There was never going to be any other outcome.O#Neill has now agreed to nominate a department and progress the scheme. This embarrassing climbdown forced by the courts could have been avoided.Why did the Deputy First Minister not just do what she was legally obliged to do months ago  She could have saved victims so much additional trauma.You#d expect Sinn Fein to at least be PR savvy. The very powerful images of men and women in wheelchairs, or with white sticks, going into court at the start of the case, should have caused a serious rethink in the party.It argues that the pension scheme discriminates against former republican prisoners. It could have pursued that issue while allowing those who have suffered the most to apply for and receive the pension they#re entitled to.The Shinners were completely isolated on this one at Stormont and beyond. A section of their own base was certainly put out by the scheme#s criteria, but it was by no means a matter which incensed or roused the entire republican community. This wasn#t a nationalist versus unionist issue. The victims behind this legal action were from all sections of the community.There were plenty of people who support justice for the Bloody Sunday families, who believe the state committed many great wrongs over the years, who still wanted the pension paid.As well as Jenner McNern#s legal challenge, a case was also brought by Brian Turley, one of the #Hooded Men# subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the British Army in .As a survivor of torture, I was left with long-term injuries as a result of the actions of the state, he said yesterday.The delay in having to wait on my right to a pension can only be described as another form of torture. Turley said O#Neill had no right to stop the pension scheme and described her action as very unprofessional.Words like that wound Sinn Fein. When the party finds itself on the opposite side to a victim of state violence like him it should know that it#s on shaky ground. Negotiations will continue between Stormont and Downing Street over who foots the pensions# bill. Naomi Long#s Justice Department will now be designated to progress the scheme. Victims hope that it will be open for applications before Christmas. I feel elated, said Margaret Yeaman who was blinded in an IRA no-warning bomb in Banbridge in  and who has never seen the faces of her grandchildren.The ruling has brought immense relief, said Mark Kelly, who lost his legs in a  no-warning UVF bomb.It#s like a weight lted off my shoulders, said Philip Gault, left with le-changing injuries as a schoolboy when he was injured in on Bloody Friday in .I should never have had to take this case, said Jenner McNern, who lost her legs in the IRA#s Abercorn bomb that year.As they celebrated their win, the surviving victims remembered those who didn#t live to see it, like Paddy Cassidy and Raymond Trimble who died so recently.It was simultaneously a victory to savour, and to shame so many in society for not delivering for these courageous men and women years ago.

I’ll be an ally of the light, not the darkness,” Mr Biden said.“Make no mistake, united we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America.” el.async  trueel.src  https:belfasttelegraph.bbvms p twocol_article c .js dart_art_IDdart_articleIddart_kw%B%Joe%%C%Biden%%C%vows%%C%to%%C%unite%%C%US%%C%as%%C%he%%C%quotes%%C%late%%C%NI%%C%poet%%C%Seamus%%C%Heaney%%Ddart_gs_channelsgs_politics%Cgv_safe_adult%Cgv_safe_arms%Cgv_safe_crime%Cgv_safe_download%Cgv_safe_drugs%Cgv_safe_hatespeech%Cgv_safe_military%Cgv_safe_obscenity%Cgv_safe_terrorism%Cgv_safe_tobacco%Cgs_politics_misc%Cgs_politics_american%Cgv_death_injury%Cgs_entertain%Cgv_processeddart_sectionnews_localandnationalnews_worlddfp_adunit_lbelfasttelegraphdfp_adunit_lNewsdfp_adunit_lWorlddocument.getElementByIdChildMr Biden’s speech was delivered inside a largely empty arena in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, at the conclusion of a Democratic convention held virtually because of a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than , Americans.The keynote address was the speech of a letime for Biden, who would be the oldest president ever electedhe defeats Donald Trump in the November  poll.Mr Trump, who is , publicly doubts Biden’s mental capacity and calls him “Slow Joe”, but with America watching, he was firm and clear.Still, the convention leaned on a younger generation earlier in the night to help energise his sprawling coalition.Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois senator who lost both legs in Iraq and is raising two young children, said Mr Biden has “common decency”.Cory Booker, only the ninth African American senator in US history, said Mr Biden believes in the dignity of all working Americans.And Pete Buttigieg, a -year-old former mayor and a gay military veteran, noted that Mr Biden came out in favour of same-sex marriage as vice president even before former president Barack Obama.“Joe Biden is right, this is a contest for the soul of the nation. And to me that contest is not between good Americans and evil Americans,” Mr Buttigieg said.“It’s the struggle to call out what is good for every American.”Above all, Mr Biden focused on uniting the nation as Americans grapple with the long and fearful health crisis, the related economic devastation, a national awakening on racial justice — and Mr Trump, who stirs heated emotions from all sides.Mr Biden’s positive focus Thursday night marked a break from the dire warnings offered by Mr Obama and others the night before.The th president of the United States warned that American democracy itself could falterMr Trump is re-elected, while Mr Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, the -year-old Calornia senator and daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, warned that Americans’ lives and livelihoods were at risk.Mr Biden’s Democratic Party has sought this week to put forward a cohesive vision of values and policy priorities, highlighting efforts to combat climate change, tighten gun laws and embrace a humane immigration policy.Mr Biden has maintained a polling advantage over Mr Trump for much of the year, but it remains to be seen whether the Democratic nominee’s approach to politics and policy will genuinely excite the coalition he is courting in an era of uncompromising partisanship.Belfast Related ContentVideoVideo NewsUS election polls: Trump trails Biden by seven pointsMost ReadBelfast woman jailed for bus journey during quarantine on Isle of Man visitMoville businessman John Mullan and his two children die in tragic Donegal road accidentCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: No new deaths and  cases of Covid- reportedRUC man#s cold-blooded killing in  subject of top journalist#s new bookNew pictures emerge of The Northman film set starring Nicole Kidman and Skarsgård brothers,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It comes after this week’s A-level results changes that mean many students will be awarded higher teacher assessed grades. As a result universities will have to offer additional places with Queens University Belfastsaying it may need up to , extra. That will necessitate the lting of the maximum student numberscap. However, at yesterdays Economy Committee meeting at Stormont, Derry MLAs Gary Middleton and Sinead McLaughlin raised concerns thatthe correct decisions arent made it could lead to further regional imbalance with more students enrolling in Belfast courses. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA Gary Middleton said there are several hundred unfilled places at Magee. While, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said thatUlster University wants to see growth at Magee it has to be engineered through the relocation of courses and the university has to invest in the marketing of the campus. The Department for the Economycontrols the number of undergraduate places available at QUB and Ulster Universityfor students from NI and those from outside the UK. Both institutions are allowed to accept between ,-, new undergraduates from Northern Ireland every year The cap exists in Northern Ireland in order to keep tuition fee costs down but results in huge competition for places. googletag.cmd.push It also means that on some courses NI students are expected to get higher grades than their counterparts applying from Great Britain. Derry politicians have called for the MaSN cap to be lted to allow universities to accommodate more students. They’ve insisted that the Magee campus should be prioritised, citing long-promised expansion to , students. However, it is courses that will determine demand and in turn additional places. A UU spokesperson said that it envisages increased demand for Magee courses such as Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence and Personalised Medicine. She commented: “At Ulster University, students are our absolute priority and we will be as flexible as possible in order to accommodate the maximum number of students possible within our existing funding and the additional flexibility already provided by Department for the Economy. “We are actively preparing for the anticipated additional demand by building in additional places for some of our most popular courses including Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence, Engineering, Law, Accounting, and Personalised Medicine. “To avail of these additional places, we urge students to contact us as soon as possible on    to discuss your options with an advisor.” The DfE pointed out that responsibility for MaSN allocation lies with Higher Education institutions. A spokesperson for the DfE said: “Until the local universities have received access to the full range of revised grades for all applicant students, they will not be able to confirm places for students or otherwise. “As such, until this process has been completed, there is no way of assessing the number of any additional HE places there may be, nor what the impact might be for each HE institution with regards to their respective MaSNs.” She added: “With regards to the MaSN cap, it is allocated on an institutional-level basis and relates to all full-time undergraduate NI and EU domiciled students it is for each institution to decide how to allocate its MaSN across both subject areas and campuses. “The Economy Minister has stated thatshe will be working with Executive colleagues to ensure that additional places and extra resources are put in place to support universities as soon as possible. “Enrolments for previous years are available athttps:www.economy-ni.gov.uk articles higher-education-enrolments”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There were plenty of smiles, but despite the blistering sunshine, the atmosphere was slightly muted. In any normal year there would have been giddy excitement, pupils slapping congratulations into each others backs. But this is education in a pandemic. The Class of  have already missed out on so much. Their final year was abruptly cut short in March, with the footballers of St Patricks on the brink of a MacRory Cup Final. From March until June in your final year of school may be peak time for exam cramming, but its also a coming-of-age period for young students. googletag.cmd.push Relationships with staff gradually takes on a more collegial feel. There is almost a feeling of being in the trenches together as they prepare together for the exams. Amid our A-Levels, myself and a friend were, not particularly diligently, preparing for a History exam that was set to take place the following day. We had nipped into the shop on the way up from Coleraine town centre and bought a sticky toffee pudding on a whim. The product required heating. Mr Bob Murphy was the most likely to do the needful for us, but when he took a look at the pair of us outside the staff room, he was exasperated. googletag.cmd.push “Boys, this is Mrs McGoldricks exam..” he began. We explained that we were grand for the exam, but would he mind heating up our dessert for us  He came back with a smile and a shake of the head, but with a freshly warmed pudding in hand. Trivial, farcical moments like that are recalled much more easily than any time spent in the exam hall, but s pupils have been denied both academic and pastoral build-up to these milestone exams. They have been disenfranchised, denied ownership of what, in many cases, is a le-changing four months. You cant cram for an exam that isnt happening. Every teacher and school leader Ive spoken to over the last week has highlighted the March to June period as a key moment in exam preparation. Pupils look at how things are going, andthe picture doesnt look great, they know its time to up the ante. Its the sprint at the end of the marathon. Principal Mrs Brenda Mussen addresses the St Patricks College, Maghera, Class of . Weirs decision yesterday afternoon to revert back to teacher predictions on AS and A results is a welcome move, but one that should have come without a four-day delay. The algorithm that would have decided the immediate future of our young people was particularly harsh on comprehensive schools. To use just the previous two years as a benchmark was unfair, particularly given the huge range in results a mixed ability cohort can throw up in any given year. Given the nature of academic selection, the risk of having a below-par set of results in a grammar school is greatly reduced, meaning the system used is already subject to in-built injustice. Results are now back in the hands of teachers and schools, rather than at the mercy of a mathematical equation. Back in the hands of the people who know the pupils. The people best-placed to assess their abilities. The people who spent weeks meticulously preparing their centre-assessed grades. “It was a kick in the teeth when you see students who have been downgraded that should not have been ,” said St Patricks Principal, Mrs Brenda Mussen, last week. This years students had been been kicked in the teeth and handed the bill for the dental work. With all exam boards across the UK now awarding on the basis of teacher judgement, the bill has been belatedly waived. The pupils of County Derry, and the whole of the country, would have been at a competitive disadvantage through no fault of their own. Reverting to teacher predictions for A-Level results at least creates a more level playing field for this years university intake.The writing has been on the wall since last Thursday. It took until yesterday for the Minister to bother to read it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June .

A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it.

It was the first time Ballinascreen were levelin a game they trailed by nine points coming up to half time. With a superior score dference, a draw wouldve been enough for Lavey, but points for Cleary and Aaron Kelly put them ahead. Fintan Bradley had a late free, but his low effort was saved by goalkeeper Marty Mulgrew and it was Screen that held on for a victory that seemed unlikely for long periods. googletag.cmd.push Their reward is a semi-final rematch with Kevin Lynchs, with Slaughtneil facing parish rivals Swatragh on the other side of the draw. Lavey will now play in the junior semi-final against Coleraine, with Banagher and Na Magha in the other semi-final. The @ScreenGAA hurlers show their respect for Hugh McWilliams before tonight’s #DerrySHC game #GAABelong pic ZxMmiuIe — Michael McMullan August ,     Both teams stood for a minute silence in memory of Ballinascreen sponsor Hugh McWilliams before the game. Lavey had the breeze at their back and with greater urgency in their play went four points ahead before Screen got to grips with the game. The Erins Own men were awarded a penalty but referee Niall Clford adjudged Fintan Bradley to have broken the line when he shot and the penalty was overturned. googletag.cmd.push Bradley was putting over some sweet scores, but missed a simple free before the break. Noel Raffertyand Paul Cleary scored early second half points for Screen, as they came back into the game. The concern at Davitt Park was the falling light and as the game developed, visibility was becoming more of a problem. Midway through the second half, Colm Murphy can feel hard done by to pick up a second yellow card and Lavey were down to  men. Seconds earlier, Noel Rafferty looked to have a certain penalty shout waved on. Without Murphy, Lavey were not able to match Screens hunger around the breaking ball and the game was already slipping away from them. Two Fintan Bradley frees looked to have weathered the storm until McSorleys winning goal.

Lissan conceded their first game to Drumsurn and last week surrendered from a position of strength against Doire Trasna. Shea McKernan had the ball in the net within minutes of the start, getting on the end of a slick passing movement to slot home. Rather than building it, eight first half wides was the story of Kieran OKanes young sides exploits. For all their shortcomings, they were well in contention and led by two points, with eight minutes to go. googletag.cmd.push Disaster struck when Stephen Conway, who made a fine first half save from Ciaran McGowan, shanked a kick-out to Eoghan Quigg who passed for Micheaacutel McNaught to strike a hammer blow to the net they never recovered from. At midfield for Lissan is the towering Conor Loane, an All-Ireland winning goalkeeper with Holy Trinity Cookstown, and MacRory Cup medallist Mattie Loughran, who kicked four points last week. The pair dovetailed well together and in Iarlaith Donaghy, they have one of the most exciting players in the county playing at number six. Defender Oran Donnelly wears , but sits back as a sweeper, with the nimble Joey Quinn playing up front with Tiarnach Donaghy. googletag.cmd.push Coming Lissans way this weekend is a Faughanvale side who have posted two wins from as many games and had a tough battle to overcome a Drumsurn side who arguably deserved a draw. Manager Joe Gray has had to come to terms with long-term injuries to Oisin Quinn and Jordan Curran. Michael McLaughlin spent last summer in America, but he is back and forms an inside forward duo with Kevin Martin. Paddy OKane is one of their key players and Lissan may face a kick-back after his quiet outing in the last round. He played off the front two, but their running game almost bypassed their middle sector. Gordon Fahey and Michael Sweeney are a formidable defensive spine, with skipper Conor McGuinness nestled between them as a sweeper - a formation that will mirror the Lissan setup,both managers adopt the same approach this time around. The Vale will also have questions to answer. When Drumsurn went down to  men, Grays side couldnt get their hands on the ball and had to rely on a strong finish. On the flip side, apart from the one they scored, the Vale carved out the best two goal chances over the course of the game. A tough ask for Lissan who cant finish above the bottom. Kieran OKane will have his side well-prepared, but Faughanvale will be fancied to come through. VERDICT: Faughanvale RELATEDJoe Grays reaction to the Vales win over Drumsurn.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time.

An accident in stage six of last weekends Rally Liepāja in Latvia, saw him forced out of the race. Devine, the current Motorsport Ireland International Driver of the Year, was out to make amends following an early retirement on the opening round in Italy late last month. Callum missed the pre event shakedown and qualying due to an issue with his Hyundai i R, but the mechanics had ready for the start of the event. He was beginning to grow in confidence on his first loose surface event at this level. Steady driving saw Callum and co-driver Brian Hoy work their way into the top  early on day two and up to fourth place among the ERC Junior crews. googletag.cmd.push It all came to an end on stage six , as Devine recalls. “We were actually just starting to get into it and growing in confidence. As I mentioned before the event, it’s not a place you want to get things wrong as the speeds are so high. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened. We carried a bit too much speed into a fast right hander and caught the undergrowth on the outside of the corner, sending us into a roll and out of the event. Myself and Brian are okay, just a little sore and thankfully all the safety equipment stood up to the accident, the Hyundai is a strong car. googletag.cmd.push I’m just so disappointed for all the team who worked so hard over the last month. To have taken just one point from the opening pair of rallies is sickening and doesn’t reflect all the work we’ve put in, hopefully we can put it right before the end of the season.” Devine’s accident casts some doubt over his participation in the next round of the championship, Rallye Azores in mid-September. The PCRS team will assess the damage to the car in the coming days but evenit can be sorted in time to make the boat to travel to the Azores, presently Portugal and its associated territories aren’t on the Irish green list for travel. “If the car can be sorted for Azores, travel restrictions could be an issue. As it stands, not only myself and Brian, but also all the mechanics would have to isolate for two weeks after ing to Ireland after the rally. I work between events so to isolate for two weeks uponwould be a big problem. Obviously government guidelines are changing all the time so we’ll just have to wait and see. It’s worth pointing out this isn’t just a problem for us, it’s a problem for all competitors and teams in the championship.” While Rallye Azores may be in doubt, one thing that isn’t in doubt in Devine’s commitment to the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy. “I realise how lucky I am to have this opportunity and I’m ready to knuckle down and refocus in preparation for our next ERC event,” Devine continued. Following Rallye Azores, the remaining rounds of the  ERC will take place in Cyprus, Hungary and the Canary Islands.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Trailing to Joseph Olowu’s early goal, the Candystripes were in trouble again, but hit back strongly in the second half with goals from Walter Figueira and Adam Hamill before James Akintunde sealed the win late on. The game started disastrously for Derry who conceded with the first attack on their goal just three minutes in, Kevin O’Connor’s high ball into a packed penalty area spilled by Peter Cherrie, allowing Joseph Olowu to capitalise, volleying the ball into the empty net to make it - to the visitors. googletag.cmd.push City were straight onto the offensive at the start of the second half two goals in three minutes turned the game on its head. City’s persistence finally paid off on  minutes as they got their equaliser and it was another goalkeeper error which led to the goal. Mark McNulty was unable to hold onto a high cross from Ciaran Coll and Jack Malone did superbly to keep the opportunity alive, pulling it back for Walter Figueira to fire home, much to the relief and delight of the home side. That relief turned to joy within two minutes as City turned the game on its head with a second goal. Again Meite was heavily involved, showing great strength and skill to hold off two Cork defenders on his way to goal. Meite seemed certain to score, but his effort was brilliantly parried by McNulty, only for the ball to roll across goal where Hammill was on hand to roll in his first goal for the club. googletag.cmd.push It took an extraordinary save from Cherrie to keep his team ahead in the last five minutes as the City goalkeeper somehow got his hand to Connor Simpson’s cross, clawing it off the goal line to save his team. The win was sealed with the very last kick of the game as James Akintunde collected the ball off Stephen Mallon and hooked the ball into the bottom corner to give the Candystripes a very valuable win. Teams DERRY CITY: Cherrie, Coll, Toal, Cole, Horgan, McCormack, Malone, Thomson , Hammill , Figueira , Meite .

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

Now that is what I call boxing yourself into an ever-decreasing corner.A few months ago I listened to a lecture from retired Supreme Court Judge Jonathan Sumption whose views, interpretations, and decisions are shown to be very much on the conservative side.It surprised me when he said that democracy is not rule by the majority, but is in fact achieved by ruling with consent of the minority.I am of an age now where I can look back and say Unionism has not, and I’m saying it mildly, done this consent-of-the-minority stuff very well.With a solid majority, confidence, and complete control for many years, Protestant unionism has played to and been played by its vested institutions.Protestant Unionism had plenty of time to sort this out and – let us be honest this time – failed badly.Statesmanship was drowned out, or backed down in the face of the loudest, angriest voices, or  saviours and promises.As I get older I look and see the community that I come fromgetting smaller, getting older, becoming even more inward and backward-looking – and worst of all now grasping at any  saviour.Doing even more of the same things that have already failed, while expecting a dferent outcome, is an easy trap to fall into. It also, by the way, fits the definition of insanity.I hope I have been harsh, although two borders – one at Newry and one at Larne port – and being firmly put in the naughty chair by Boris and England should be stark enough reminder.Ms O’Neill sees a United Ireland in  years, which I strongly doubt she and her cohort can deliver.For the Persuadabales however, when it comes to being swayed by a Claire Hannah, Colm Eastwood or Daniel McCrossan, it would be a very dferent story, given the right pragmatic conditions.Henry McKeown, Ballymena: We are drting blindly towards a new lockdown – and we do so at our perilA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
