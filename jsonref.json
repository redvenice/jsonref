If the jumbo jet failed, Boeing would have ceased to exist, and tens of thousands of workers would have lost their jobs.Those magnificent men (and women) and their flying machines:...\u0027Write down your (telephone) number and give it to your...Share this articleAt 11.35am, Waddell watched the engines reaching the necessary level of thrust for take-off. He then released the brakes at the northern end of Paine Field near the city of Everett in Washington state, and the massive plane lumbered down the runway.Onlookers held their breath, especially at the moment when the plane\u0027s nose just started to lift. This was it. \u0027Rotate\u0027 called Waddell, using the aeronautical term for pulling back on the yoke.          Passengers sit down to enjoy the music inside the spacious piano lounge on board the  American Airlines Boeing 747 Airplane          This picture captures passengers congregating inside the spacious lounge of American Airlines Boeing 747 Airplane for drinks and food           Inside the Sky Club Coach Section of the American Airlines Boeing 747, passengers enjoy plenty of leg room as they are served drinks and food by the flight attendants            A mockup image shows the spacious seating and leg room inside the Boeing 747. When it first took to the skies it transformed the world of  aviationA few seconds later, hurtling at just over 150 mph, the first jumbo jet took to the skies. From that moment on, the world of aviation would never be the same again.Since the first flight of the Boeing 747 half a century ago, the jumbo has transported 3.5 billion passengers as well as billions of tons of cargo all around the planet — including another aviation icon, the Space Shuttle, which was ferried around America on the back of a jumbo.More than any other aircraft, the jumbo jet, with its ability to transport around 600 passengers over 8,000 miles at just under the speed of sound, has shrunk the world.It also ushered in an age of luxury in the skies: glamorous air stewardesses who offered a smile as they marshalled food trolleys up the aisle serving filet mignon from an a la carte menu cocktails served to sharply dressed businessmen wreathed in cigar smoke.This was a time when commercial flights were a holiday in themselves. But now, 50 years later, the jumbo is slowly disappearing from our skies.Although nearly 1,600 have been built since 1969, there are only around 500 still flying.British Airways, Boeing\u0027s biggest jumbo customer, has only 34 in the air, with a further 36 in storage. By 2024, the airline will have stopped flying them altogether.Dutch airline KLM is also phasing them out, while Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines are now only using 747s — which weigh 435 tons at full-capacity — as cargo planes.You do not need to be an aeroplane anorak to find this a little sad. Many of us have an enormous affection for the jumbo, and no matter how many times you fly on one, you still can\u0027t help but be impressed by its size.The jumbo\u0027s demise is no fault of its age. Boeing is still producing planes even today, with some 24 orders for the latest cargo version — the 747-8F — on its books. Its problem lies in its cost.On a practical level, it is now possible to fly around 400 passengers across the Atlantic on two engines, and it makes little financial sense to fly 600 people the same distance on the jumbo\u0027s four.Environmental tariffs and landing fees levied by airports have also dramatically increased.Landing a jumbo at full capacity at Heathrow costs around £12,500. Of that, nearly £4,000 is in environmental tariffs, whereas for a Boeing 787, which can take around 330 passengers, that tariff is around £1,000.With airlines operating at such tight margins, it is far more economical to fly two 787s from, say, New York to London, than one jumbo jet.But while the jumbo\u0027s days might be numbered, it certainly had an extraordinarily good run.After all, its creators thought all long-haul aircraft would be supersonic by the Seventies, and planned to phase it out after a decade. Many at Boeing didn\u0027t even think the jumbo would last that long, given its birth was beset by myriad problems. The eventual choice of engine, made by Pratt \u0026amp Whitney and known as the JT9D, was a particular cause for concern.It suffered from power surges and had a tendency to stall — hardly ideal characteristics for any plane, let alone one as large as the 747.The JT9D\u0027s blades also rubbed against the bottom of the engine casing, which not only made it underperform, but was also potentially lethal if it destroyed the engine.    The Space Shuttle Orbiter is mounted on top of a Boeing 747 carrier aircraft and flown. The first landing test took place on 12th August 1977          The Space Shuttle Endeavour lifts off just just after sunrise on the first leg of its journey back to the Kennedy Space Center atop a Boeing 747 carrier aircraft          The Space Shuttle Discovery sits on top of  NASA\u0027s modified Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft as the aircraft takes flight from with Edwards Air Force Base in CaliforniaAnother large problem was the basic design of the plane, which was intended to have two decks.But during testing, they found it impossible to evacuate the plane within the required 90 seconds, and, worse still, people actually broke bones at they slid down escape chutes a few storeys high.As a result, the size of the top deck was reduced. But despite such problems, on September 30, 1968, the first 747 was rolled out to meet the press and public.To the tune of Elgar\u0027s Pomp and Circumstance, it emerged from its hangar, its red and white livery gleaming in the sun.Despite the fact that the 747 had never flown, the plane boasted the insignia of the 26 airlines that had already placed orders. Accompanying the plane — which would be called City of Everett — were female cabin crew from each of the airlines, who somewhat haphazardly smashed bottles of champagne against the fuselage.When the test flight took place just over four months later, the plane was treated somewhat better. Pilot Jack Waddell only tried the most gentle manoeuvres, and was delighted to find the 747 handled well.But, looking at the temperature gauge in the cockpit, he noticed that — for some unknown reason — one of the Pratt \u0026amp Whitney engines was running some 30 degrees hotter than the others. Rather than panic, Waddell coolly decided to continue to climb, and the engines suffered no further issues.But, several minutes later, Waddell lowered the wings\u0027 flaps and the three-strong crew heard a strange thud.Something was emphatically not right and, after a quick investigation by chief engineer Jess Wallick, it emerged that part of the flaps on the starboard wing had worked loose. This was a reason for ending the flight and, after one hour and 16 minutes, Waddell made the jumbo\u0027s first ever landing.Despite the glitches, the test flight was judged a success, and just under a year later — on January 21, 1970 — 336 passengers sat in Pan Am\u0027s Clipper of America to take the first commercial jumbo flight, from New York to London.Its lift-off was somewhat stunted, however. As the plane taxied down the runway, the pilot noted the exhaust temperature from one engine was too high. Deciding that safety was more important than public relations, he returned to the terminal.Unsurprisingly, the passengers, all of whom had paid $375 for their tickets — about $5,000 today — were thoroughly annoyed.Luckily, there was a spare 747, the Clipper Victor, which Pan Am had received only the day before. The passengers switched planes and touched down at London Heathrow just six hours and 16 minutes later.Since 1970, the 747 has had, well, many ups and downs. The plane has been involved in nearly 150 accidents and incidents, most of which have been caused by human error, or terrorism.In total, 3,746 people have died in jumbo jets. That may sound high, but it represents just 0.0001 per cent of all those who have flown on the 747.Tragic though those deaths undoubtedly are, there is much we should celebrate about the jumbo.It has carried everything from American presidents to pregnant livestock, and even though we will see less of her, she will continue to fly for many years to come.She is unlikely to survive another 50 years, but when she does land for the final time, she will never be forgotten.Boeing 747 — A History: Delivering The Dream by Martin Bowman is published by Pen \u0026amp Sword.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/11/18/04F9B421000007D0-0-image-m-41_1549908106001.jpg","title":"How Corbyn vowed defeat EU explosive unseen footage Left wing rally","story":"Jeremy Corbyn called for the European Union to be \u0027defeated\u0027 in an explosive rally speech (file photo)Labour expels just 12 people for anti-Semitism after...Boris Johnson says he could vote for Brexit deal if backstop...Share this articleIt comes after previous footage showed Mr Corbyn condemning the EU as a \u0027European empire of the 21st century\u0027 and a \u0027military Frankenstein\u0027.In the new footage unearthed by talkRADIO, he is shown saying: \u0027They, the world\u0027s bankers, International Monetary Fund, European Union, they are utterly united in what they want.\u0027Utterly united in deflation, suppressing the economy, and creating unemployment.

In this undated photo, taken in an unknown location, two men stand next to what are thought to be crates full of gold before it was loaded on board          One of the fascinating images shows the Orient Line ship Ormonde pulling away from the company\u0027s wharf in Sydney - an area that now features high-rise apartments leading along a fashionable boardwalk to the Sydney Opera House. Ormonde was in service from 1917 to 1952, serving its last few years as an emigrant ship transporting so-called ten pound poms from Britain to Australia          During the final years of her career the Orient Line ship Oriana, launched in 1959, was a familiar sight at South Pacific island ports during cruises from Sydney. In this photograph, believed to have been taken in the early 1980s, she is pictured arriving at the Fijian port of Suva under the watchful eyes of the Fijian constabulary          In the days before cruise ships had portable pontoons, passengers at ports where the ship could not go alongside would descend a sometimes swaying gangplank which would be lowered over the side of the ship into the waiting launches belowThe Orient Line can be credited with being a pioneer in the cruise industry in Britain from as far back as 1889, the authors said.\u0027The Orient Line had a significant impact on shipping, especially in Australia and the United Kingdom. Yet today the importance of the company is relatively unknown away from maritime historians and dedicated ocean liner buffs,\u0027 the authors continued.\u0027Despite its undeniable impact on the development of modern Australia, the story of the Orient Line is often relegated to a chapter or two in books about P\u0026ampO, largely thanks to its acquisition and eventual absorption by the larger company.\u0027           Many of the Orient Line\u0027s ships were used during the two world wars. One of the vessels, Osterley, is pictured anchored in New York Harbour on Armistice Day, November 11, 1918. The Great War had ended and, to celebrate, Osterley was decked out with flags. During the war it had been given \u0027razzle dazzle\u0027 camouflage. The design was believed to make it difficult to estimate a target\u0027s range, speed, and heading          Until the early 1920s, all Orient Line ships were driven by coal-fired engines, which meant that the ship\u0027s coal bunkers had to be frequently replenished during the voyage.

She seems unsteady on her feet in the CCTV footage obtained by MailOnline  Having been turned away from the club by doorman who believed she was too drunk, Libby is seen less than five minutes later being led away by friends who make sure she is ok and wait with her until she is put into a cab and driven home  Libby (left and right) arrived home two miles away on Wellesley Avenue at 11.29pm, although it\u0027s not believed she entered the property. She was seen on Beverley Road at 11.40pm near to a bench when a motorist stopped and offered her help  A map of Hull shows the second year philosophy student\u0027s movements on the night of  August 31 in Hull before she vanishedLess than five-minutes later, her friends make sure she is ok and wait with her until she is put into a cab and driven home.  The footage - taken on the evening of January 31 - was recorded by a camera on a business next to the club, who have allowed these images to be published by MailOnline to help find the second year philosophy student. She is 5ft 7ins tall with shoulder length brown hair and can be seen wearing a black long sleeved top, leather jacket and black denim skirt with lace. The owner of the CCTV, property agent Lukasz Rybus said: \u0027I want Libby to be found, to be back with her family and friends. \u0027This footage shows that she was dressed all in black and seems to be wearing lighter coloured trainers or boots. \u0027I just hope that this footage helps jog someone\u0027s memory, if it helps someone remember seeing her, that can only be a positive thing.\u0027           Libby and her friends were last seen trying to get into The Welly Club (pictured) which was holding a student nightLibby arrived home about two miles away on Wellesley Avenue around 11.29pm, although it\u0027s not believed she entered the property.She was seen on Beverley Road at 11.40pm near to a bench and close to the junction with Haworth Street, when a motorist stopped and offered her help. Humberside Police believe she may have been in this area until around 12.09am.Detective Superintendent Mathew Hutchinson said: \u0027We are still treating Libby\u0027s disappearance as a missing person\u0027s enquiry.\u0027I have said previously that we are keeping an open mind as to her whereabouts and that is still very much the case.

The Clooneys made the wedding and the after party guest list, and Markle family seats in the church were taken by stars like Oprah WinfreyI wasn’t entirely surprised though given my own bizarre ‘ghosting’ experience with Ms Markle that suggested to me she’s a ruthless social climber.No wonder then that her family feel less than enamoured towards the newly ennobled Duchess: she’s dumped them all like a sack of rancid potatoes, lest they poison her perfect new privileged royal well.I thought of this today when I read George Clooney’s impassioned defence of Meghan over recent negative headlines.He attacked the media: ‘They’re just chasing Meghan Markle, she’s being pursued and vilified.’Then he directly compared her to Harry’s mother, Princess Diana: ‘She is being pursued and hunted and chased in the same way that Diana was, and it’s history repeating itself.’He ended with a chilling warning: ‘And we’ve seen how that ends. I can’t tell you how frustrating it is to see that.’Hmmm.  On Monday George Clooney attacked the media: ‘They’re just chasing Meghan Markle, she’s being pursued and vilified.’ Then he directly compared her to Harry’s mother, Princess Diana: ‘She is being pursued and hunted and chased in the same way that Diana was\u0027George Clooney claims his friend Meghan is being \u0027pursued...PIERS: Meghan Markle is a social climber and ghosted meShare this articleThere is a certain irony in Clooney saying all this just days after Meghan directed five of her best friends to speak to People magazine and knife her poor father in the back.Just as there was when Diana harangued the media for intrusion, but would repeatedly collude with newspaper journalists (I know, I was one of the people she colluded with!) to get herself positive press coverage and settle scores with people she didn’t like.Clooney at least is consistent he furiously blamed the media entirely for Diana’s death.To him, there is no correlation between using the press to promote or spin your brand, and then being scrutinised by the same press, sometimes critically.To me, there is.When she met Harry, Meghan wasn’t some naïve young 19-year-old virgin like Diana. She was a 35-year-old orcee with a successful acting career who knew exactly what she was doing.She landed her handsome, much younger Prince, and now enjoys the spectacularly opulent lifestyle of palaces and servants that comes with marrying into the British royal family.She has milked all the global fame and attention that’s subsequently come her way with obvious glee.  Meghan wasn’t a naïve  19-year-old virgin, but a 35-year-old orcee with a successful career when she landed her handsome young Prince. Diana was the biggest star on the planet Meghan isn’t even in the top three stars living at Kensington PalaceAnd honestly, if this is the life Meghan’s always dreamed of, then good luck to her.But there is absolutely no comparison between the amount of media attention she gets and the amount Diana experienced.Diana was the biggest star on the planet Meghan isn’t even in the top three biggest stars currently living at Kensington Palace.And Clooney is not just wrong about that.He’s also wrong to blame the media for negative headlines driven largely by Meghan’s own family.They are the ones vilifying her because she has disowned them all, and they understandably feel hurt about that.Meghan’s letter to her father, that he only disclosed this week after the People magazine cover story came out, was a template in the modern scourge of celebrity victimhood.It was all about HER feelings, HER marriage, HER life, HER pain.But what about her dad’s feelings - HIS life, HIS pain?          Meghan’s letter to her father was a template in the modern scourge of celebrity victimhood. It was all about HER feelings, HER marriage, HER life, HER painI’ve interviewed Thomas Markle twice, and get the impression he’s a decent guy who hasn’t had a clue how to handle the enormous media scrutiny that came when his daughter married a prince.Yes, he’s made mistakes, like posing for staged photos with the paparazzi, and he’s admitted to them.But he’s also lost his little girl, the one he helped bring up, educate, nurture and succeed. The one who posted a touching Father’s Day card on Instagram just weeks before she met Prince Harry, telling Thomas how much she loved him.Meghan can try to pin all the blame on her dad for this mess, as she’s now doing, but has she really been as blameless as she would have us all believe?It’s staggering to me that Harry still hasn’t met the man whose daughter he married.It’s staggering to me that neither Meghan nor Harry has bothered to go see Thomas, even after he suffered a heart attack.          Meghan can try to pin all the blame on her dad for this mess, but has she really been as blameless as she would have us believe? It’s staggering  that Harry never met the man whose daughter he marriedIt’s staggering to me that Meghan thinks the way to resolve this bitter dispute is to unleash her friends to attack her dad in People magazine.And it’s staggering to me that George Clooney now believes it’s a good idea to blame the media for everything, and compare Meghan to Diana.Clooney is a smart guy.He must have sat in the church at the big wedding and secretly shared everyone else’s view that it was very odd to see just one person from the bride’s entire family there amid a sea of celebrities.The problem here isn’t the media, which has largely given Meghan a very positive ride.The problem is Meghan’s incredibly toxic relationship with her family that shows no sign of abating and in fact, gets worse by the day.A real friend would tell her to get on a plane with her husband, and make peace with her ailing, flailing father – before it’s too late.But is George Clooney a REAL friend, or just another famous person Meghan’s latched onto at the expense of those who until recently, she professed to care about most?The biggest problem here may lie in the answer to that question."},{"url":null,"title":"Lawyer man sued Lufthansa not using leg plane journey says client WIN case","story":"    The man booked a return ticket from Seattle to Oslo via Frankfurt, but instead took a separate flight to Berlin during the changeover in Frankfurt.

Astonishing moment a parent helps her toddler...Thousands of Ryanair customer compensation claims to go to...Share this articleLufthansa is taking a stand because it is hit harder than most other airlines by the practice.That is because so many of their flights are routed through the hubs of Frankfurt and Munich. Terms and conditions when buying tickets through Lufthansa do, however, make it clear the practice is not allowed. Dr Böse told MailOnline his client, who booked the Frankfurt-Berlin flight himself about a month after the initial Seattle flight booking - never suspected that his actions would land him with a legal case. He outlined a series of arguments each of which, he claimed, would see Lufthansa fail in their action against his client.Dr Böse claimed the terms and conditions referred to in the case were not legally binding in German civil law and that the lack in transparency by not showing the amount of the \u0027penalty\u0027 when making a reservation.He said this element of the terms and conditions was unreasonable because it would also apply when airlines had to skip a journey segment - for example if there was a delayed inbound flight. Dr Böse said the clause is \u0027surprising as no average passenger would expect having to pay more when flying less\u0027 adding that there were other clauses in the T\u0026ampCs which appeared to conflict with the retrocharging-clause.\u0027Every single argument would lead to a dismissal of action from our legal point of view,\u0027 he told MailOnline.\u0027The local court of Berlin-Mitte decided to go with the missing-transparency-solution.

Donald Trump has told Americans his administration had accelerated talks for a political settlement in Afghanistan and would be able to reduce US troops there as negotiations advance to end America’s longest war.No one knows what form a new government may take or how much control the Taliban might have under any deal, but for young people who were babies when the Taliban were driven from power by a US-led campaign in 2001, the prospect of peace with the hardline Islamists brings a daunting mix of hope and fear.For villagers in rural Afghanistan, where traditional ways have always counted for more than central government law, life may not change much. But for the young of Kabul and other cities, there is much to lose, in particular the freedoms restored after the Taliban were ousted – from playing music, to modelling and adopting trendy haircuts – which they’ve grown up with.“The thing I’m most worried about is that if they return, I’ll not be able to continue playing music,” said a 16-year-old pianist who attends music school in Kabul.  “It will be great if the government and the Taliban reach a peace deal. At that time there should be access to music for everyone and women’s rights must be protected.”When the Taliban were last in power, they gained global notoriety for a harsh regime that forced women and girls to stay at home, restricted music and sports and imposed brutal punishment on infractions of a hardline version of Islamic law. More recently, they have adopted a more moderate tone, including pledges on rights for women and girls’ education, appeals for support from foreign aid groups and promises to maintain good international relations.While huge doubts remain, the peace talks have given young people a sense of hope.  “I am optimistic about the Taliban joining the peace process,” said Hussain, 19, who like many young Afghans grew up in neighbouring Iran where millions have taken refuge from war. He now works as a hairdresser in Kabul. “It will be an end to the war and conflicts in our country. I want the Taliban to change their policy and not behave like before.”They have also had to deal with near-daily violence and a broken economy that cannot provide jobs for the 400,000 or so new entrants to the workforce every year. Hundreds of thousands have migrated in the years since 2014, when most foreign forces left. Many have risked dangerous journeys in search of new homes in countries such as Turkey, or in Europe or further afield. For some of those who have remained, there is now hope that peace will bring opportunities.Women’s rights have improved in recent years under the western-backed Afghan government, especially in cities such as the capital Kabul, where many women work outside the home and more than a quarter of the parliament is female.The male generational gap may be explained by younger men seeking rigid gender roles as they struggle to find work and stability in a country ravaged by war and poverty, said gender equality group Promundo. Religious teachings against women’s rights under the Taliban regime had also played a role in hardening views among younger men.Sultan Qasim Sayeedi, an 18-year-old model scours Facebook, YouTube and Instagram to learn about fashion and modelling, and draws inspiration from his favourite models, including Saudi Arabia’s Omar Borkan, and Canadian popstar Justin Bieber. “We’re afraid that if the Taliban come then we will not be able to hold our shows,” he said. Despite that wariness, Sultan says it’s time the fighting ended. “If American troops will go peace will come, we want peace,” he said.Maryam Ghulami, a 20-year-old living in the western province of Herat, says her generation will bring change that her parents never could. She is learning graphic design and computer coding at an online academy and likes to hone her skills with YouTube tutorials. While she believes Afghanistan faces many problems – a slow and unreliable internet connection, for a start – she has faith that her generation can bring change. “The new generation can change Afghanistan with knowledge, with technology,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0c7301986897f30e933777e6a22e3c8e72046fb/56_201_3185_1910/master/3185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b68aa0d732785130d1dc2a70107eec6d","title":"tell us what books are the most shocking or disturbing","story":"On this week’s books podcast, we discuss the works that we struggled to finish – or even had to hide – because they were so shocking. “I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us,” Franz Kafka once wrote. “If the book we’re reading doesn’t wake us up with a blow to the head, what are we reading for?”That’s all very well, Kafka, but how about the books literally about wounding and stabbing?

It lost money for years, making sales of about £70m and losses of £4.5m in 2009.BlueGem had hoped to bring Liberty back to the stock market last year, but has now hired UBS to seek a private buyer, according to Sky News, which first reported the potential sale.The retailer is on the market during a period of great upheaval for department stores, which face competition from online shopping and a squeeze on consumer spending.House of Fraser went into administration last summer and was bought out by Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct group. He also has his eye on Debenhams, which is struggling for survival after several years of poor trading and rising costs.But Liberty, the focus of a long-running Channel 4 documentary series, is among a handful of department store brands to retain an international cachet, alongside Harrods, Selfridges and Harvey Nichols.This is likely to prove attractive to high net worth investors such as the Weston family, the Canadian arm of which owns Selfridges and the Brown Thomas department store in Ireland, while the British arm owns the London food emporium Fortnum \u0026amp Mason and the Heal’s furniture chain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbacd8f9253ef639a4537b3224facea461931b4d/356_853_3204_1923/master/3204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a70752bfe4ae59c063a68bce45f656a0","title":"what different measures of inflation are we being conned","story":"The UK uses three measures and each has its fans, but it does seem unnecessarily complicatedMPs press Treasury to abandon ‘absurd’ inflation measureAre we being conned on the real rate?That’s a constant refrain – from pensioners, who argue that CPI is falsely low because it over reflects the falling price of electronics but not the rocketing cost of heating bills and council tax and from younger adults, who argue that it doesn’t capture sky-high increases in house prices.So should we trust the figures?Give the statisticians some slack here. Broadly, the CPI should be seen as a shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households in the UK – around 700 items, from the cost of a cinema seat to the price of a pint at the local pub, from a holiday in Spain to the cost of a bicycle. The ONS accepts that no one is “average”, and that the CPI inflation figure may not strictly apply to any one inidual or family, but “still gives us a useful yardstick of the impact of inflation on our own pocket or purse”.Why does the government continue to use RPI for student loans and rail fares?It’s hard not to agree with the House of Lords economic affairs committee, which concluded that the government is engaged in “inflation shopping” – using the lower CPI figure where it has to pay out – such as for welfare benefits – but switching to the higher RPI number when it wants to charge people, such as for student loans and rail fares. Even the ONS acknowledges that RPI has serious shortcomings, and no longer designates it as a proper national statistic.Why don’t we just dump RPI?There is a thorny problem with the tens of billions of pounds worth of bonds issued by the government – called index-linked gilts – which are contractually obliged to pay interest based on the RPI figure.

Eight years ago he moved back to street art and now combines his skills to create vibrant, abstract murals on buildings across the world.The walls are Louf’s canvas, and he plays off different structures and shapes on the buildings. His only restriction is his fascination for hexagons.“My walls are more the playground version of that study of the hexagon form,” he says. “In my mind I have the hexagon, and I just react on the wall or on the element of the wall. That’s the base and beginning of every painting I make.”The colourful murals distort the way the viewer understands architecture and the building’s structure. “The most exciting element is that every canvas of every wall is a different one, it’s a different shape. The elements are also different.”There’s a beauty about working outside, he says. “I always say that I make public art – the fact that people can see it no matter who they are.” Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at@cities.

If they don’t, the European Union will go the way of the Soviet Union in 1991. Neither our leaders nor ordinary citizens seem to understand that we are experiencing a revolutionary moment, that the range of possibilities is very broad, and that the eventual outcome is thus highly uncertain.Most of us assume the future will more or less resemble the present, but this is not necessarily so. In a long and eventful life, I have witnessed many periods of what I call radical disequilibrium. We are living in such a period today.The next inflection point will be the elections for the European parliament, in May 2019. Unfortunately, anti-EU forces will enjoy a competitive advantage. There are several reasons for this, including the outdated party system in most European countries, the practical impossibility of treaty change and the lack of legal tools for disciplining member states that violate the principles on which the EU was founded. The EU can impose its laws on applicant countries but it lacks sufficient capacity to enforce member states’ compliance.The antiquated party system hampers those who want to preserve the values on which the EU was founded, but it helps those who want to replace those values with something radically different. This is true in inidual countries and even more so in trans-European alliances. The party system of inidual states reflects the isions that mattered in the 19th and 20th centuries, such as the conflict between capital and labour. But the cleavage that matters most today is between pro- and anti-European forces.The EU’s dominant country is Germany, whose dominant political alliance – between the Christian Democratic Union and the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union – has become unsustainable. The alliance worked as long as there was no significant party in Bavaria to the right of the CSU. That changed with the rise of the extremist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). In last September’s länder elections, the CSU’s result was its worst in more than six decades, and the AfD entered the Bavarian parliament for the first time.The AfD’s rise removed the raison d’etre of the CDU-CSU alliance. But that alliance cannot be broken up without triggering new elections that neither Germany nor Europe can afford. And the ruling coalition cannot be robustly pro-European while facing the AfD threat.The situation is far from hopeless. The German Greens have emerged as the only consistently pro-European party in the country, and they continue to rise in opinion polls, whereas the AfD seems to have reached its high point (except in the former East Germany). But now CDUCSU voters are represented by a party whose commitment to European values is ambivalent.In the United Kingdom too an antiquated party structure prevents the popular will from finding proper expression. Both Labour and the Conservatives are internally ided, but their leaders, Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May, respectively, are determined to deliver Brexit. The situation is so complicated that most Britons just want to get it over with, although it will be the defining event for the country for decades to come.Collusion between Corbyn and May has aroused opposition in both parties, which in the case of Labour is bordering on rebellion. May has announced a programme to aid impoverished pro-Brexit Labour constituencies in the north of England. And Corbyn is accused of betraying the pledge he made at Labour’s last party conference to back a second Brexit referendum if he can’t trigger a general election.The chances that May’s deal will again be rejected by MPs are growing by the day. That could set in motion a groundswell of support for a referendum – or, even better, for revoking Britain’s article 50 notification.Italy finds itself in a similar predicament. The EU made a fatal mistake in 2017 by strictly enforcing the Dublin agreement, which unfairly burdens countries, such as Italy, where migrants first enter the EU. This drove its predominantly pro-European and pro-immigration electorate into the arms of the anti-European League party and Five Star Movement in last year’s election. The previously dominant Democratic party is in disarray. As a result, the many voters who remain pro-European have no party to vote for. There is, however, an attempt to organise a united pro-European list. A similar reordering of party systems is happening in France, Poland and Sweden.When it comes to trans-European alliances, the situation is even worse. National parties at least have some roots in the past, but these alliances are entirely dictated by party leaders’ self-interest. The European People’s party (EPP) alliance is the worst offender – almost entirely devoid of principles, as demonstrated by its willingness to embrace Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party in order to preserve its majority and control the allocation of top EU jobs. Anti-European forces may look good in comparison: at least they have some principles, even if they are odious.It is difficult to see how the pro-EU parties can emerge victorious from the May elections unless they put Europe’s interests ahead of their own. One can still make a case for preserving the EU in order radically to reinvent it. But that would require a change of heart within the EU. The current leadership is reminiscent of the politburo when the Soviet Union collapsed – continuing to issue edicts as if they were still relevant.The first step to defending Europe from its enemies, both internal and external, is to recognise the magnitude of the threat they present. The second is to awaken the sleeping pro-European majority and mobilise it to defend the values on which the EU was founded. Otherwise, the dream of a united Europe could become a 21st-century nightmare.• George Soros is the chairman of Soros Fund Management and of the Open Society FoundationsA version of this article has also appeared on Project Syndicate"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3791d94a5493aa22fe513afbf753c5cfa8edfd2/0_240_6500_3902/master/6500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d68d1d66e40756840db2328ebc7d9a5","title":"i cant do twitter i already spend 43 hours a week on my phone","story":"Call it cowardice, stubbornness or stupidity, but I feel tweeting would be like opening the gates to hellEvery six months or so my editor on Radio 5 Live takes me to one side, wearing a look on his face I know too well. It’s a beseeching expression conveying concern, a little trepidation and grim resolve. I know what’s coming.“Adrian,” he says. “I really think you need to go on Twitter.”I don’t blame him for asking. A Twitterless presenter is an awful thing for any production team to be saddled with. It must feel like having to go back to recording stuff on quarter-inch tape, to be spliced up and run on an old ReVox. I thank them for their forbearance.I don’t take this stance on principle, and I’m certainly not proud of it. Call it cowardice, call it stubbornness, call it stupidity, naivety or whatever you like. I plead guilty on every count. It’s career suicide, apart from anything else. If a programme-maker can get a presenter with 100,000 followers on board, or me with none, who are they going to plump for? But I just can’t bring myself to tweet. It would feel like opening up the gates of hell. Why would I do that?I’m led to believe there’s dreadful personal abuse out there. In my time, I’ve had a fair amount directed at me. Back in the day, when I worked in football, I used to read in the newspapers how loathed I was on Twitter. So I was getting trolled without even being on it? That felt like quite a thing.At the World Cup in Rio, I worried that things were getting so bad it might be upsetting my teenage daughters back home. I called to check. “Nah,” said one of them. “It’s funny.”Plainly, I’m missing something. Is the nasty stuff really that nasty, or does it amount to not much more than good knockabout pantomime villainy, to be taken with a pinch of salt? I was in a radio studio with the political comic Matt Forde last week. A tweeter told him he was “fat Blairite scum”. I winced a bit. He tittered happily. I wish I could be like him.Perhaps I should start. But how? The whole world seems to be really good at this dangerous business. You can’t just join in, can you? It would be like running on the pitch, without training, into the middle of a full-blown game of rugby league. I’d get hurt. Are there any beginners’ classes available? I’m concerned I would look like my dad, bewildered, poking tentatively at the iPhone I gave him. He uses his ring finger, for some reason, which makes it even harder (try it).But my biggest issue is the time it would all take. Unbidden, as far as I know, my phone has started telling me how much I’m using it. It bears bad tidings. It turns out that, without being on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat, I’m picking up the wretched thing 133 times a day. Over the past week I have notched up a mindbending, completely shaming 43 hours staring at my phone.Apparently this is mostly spent on WhatsApp, emails and looking at websites. I have my answer the next time my editor asks for a quiet word about Twitter: “I’m really sorry – I just don’t have the time.”It might be easier to just go and live in a cave, idly drawing on the walls with my ring finger, and wait for the world to calm down a bit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1610b2d3261a646b1cd5a2ae1b070109f026a9a/0_239_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349f4f72fe8703a58096dbdc451432a2","title":"universal basic income work finland experiment payments","story":"The danger of so-called “free money” not only underpins critiques of universal basic income (UBI), but also the incredibly strong narratives that underlie the attitudes to work in the UK (and elsewhere) – and our unemployment benefit system. Paid employment is held up as one of the ultimate markers of being a valuable member of society, with those not in paid work (always described in these narratives as a voluntary position, rather than as the result of issues outside their control) seen as a drain on society. Those out of work are positioned in direct contrast to those in paid employment: the shirkers versus the strivers, the “welfare dependent” versus the hardworking families.For those in paid work, working hard and being constantly busy are worn as a badge of pride, and there are whole industries promising to make us more productive and efficient. For some, hard work is enforced through workplace monitoring, impossibly short breaks or expectations of staff being “always on”, for example responding to emails outside work hours. Work is idealised as providing meaning in our lives, while at the same time removing us from other sources of meaning, such as family, friends and our communities, through long hours and unpaid overtime. The negative psychological, social and physical effects of these narratives and assumptions are now being investigated, and the centrality of work in our lives and society questioned.Preliminary results from Finland’s basic income experiment found little to no impact on recipients’ likelihood of undertaking paid employment. This has led some to suggest that the experiment is a failure – indeed, the Finnish government had hoped the plan would increase participation in paid work. However, although it was not a trial of a full UBI (universal, unconditional, non-withdrawable and non means-tested) it is being celebrated by many who advocate the idea, as it provides important evidence about the interaction of UBI and work. One of the major objections is that getting “free money” would undermine recipients’ motivation to undertake paid work: the Finnish case shows this is not so.The notion that paid employment is the cure to all ills has been seriously undermined, if it were ever true. Work as the best route out of poverty may still hold true for some, but the majority of households in poverty in the UK are now consistently those with at least one person in work. The likelihood of people becoming stuck in low-wage, low-skilled work is significant, and hard work among the lower paid is doing nothing to reduce economic inequalities. Coupled with the potential threat to many jobs and industries from automation and AI (although we need to be careful not to overstate this), the relentless prioritisation of paid work seems less defensible.Whether we derive meaning from employment, or find ourselves engaged in meaningless “bullshit jobs” as David Graeber suggests, we cannot deny that the world of work is changing. Climate change, mass migration and continued technological change will all have impacts on what “work” means and looks like in ways that we cannot accurately predict.For its proponents, a UBI can provide a lifejacket and a route through some of these challenges. A UBI could provide a stable income floor, a guaranteed minimum below which no one would fall. Depending on the amount paid, it could enable low-paid workers to turn down the worst jobs on offer, or enable time away from paid work to retrain, or start a business. It would financially compensate those (usually women) caring for family for their work, support more people to be creative, to volunteer, or simply to do nothing. In the US, proposals for a Green New Deal led by Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey appear to advocate for something like a UBI – potentially for those “unwilling” to work, although it is light on detail.A UBI is not designed to promote “laziness” or any other type of behaviour, simply to allow iniduals to make their own decisions about how they wish to spend their time. The pure idea of a UBI does not hold any inherent position when it comes to paid work, but promises freedom and choice. As far back as the 1880s, in the work of Paul Lafargue, the right of workers (as opposed to the rich) to be lazy was framed as an explicit rejection of the dominant work ethic, and the route to true independence, free from the pressure to work. The refusal to participate in paid employment is still considered by some as an active strategy of resistance to neoliberalism. A UBI as a way to live securely without paid employment features regularly in mainly leftwing discussions about post-work, interrogating the centrality of paid employment in our lives and societies, and our ability to liberate ourselves, or be liberated from, our roles as paid workers.In reality, the likelihood of any western country introducing a UBI at a rate to enable the average worker to entirely opt out of paid employment is extremely low (in Finland, participants received €560 (£475) a month, in Ontario, participants were guaranteed a minimum income of $16,989 (£13,185) a year). Most of the current trials around the world actively frame UBI as a pro-employment policy, smoothing the sharp edges of benefit systems and the insecurities of the modern labour market, to make paid employment more feasible, attractive and sustainable. The utopian vision of a life of leisure in which a UBI offers us a comfortable standard of living is not about to become reality, but the ideas of working less, and receiving a stable, humane basic income are gaining traction and starting to influence debate in ways unthinkable even 10 years ago.• Anna Dent is a freelance policy and research consultant"},{"url":null,"title":"trevor noah ralph northam michael scott of politics","story":"Late-night hosts recap a weekend of apology tours in Virginia, more Democrats running for president and a Jeff Bezos’s ‘complexifier’Late-night hosts respond to ignorance over indentured servants, Native American history and the power of Jeff Bezos’s vocabulary.Virginia governor Ralph Northam embarked on an apology tour over the weekend, a week after a yearbook photo with blackface and a Ku Klux Klan costume brought calls for his resignation.In an interview with Gayle King, Northam said he won’t step down because he’s learned his lesson. But “the question is: what exactly has he learned?” asked Trevor Noah on Monday’s Daily Show.Northam acknowledged that he’s a beneficiary of white privilege, as reports emerged that staff have supplied him a race re-education diet of the novel Roots and Ta-Nehisi Coates’s article “The Case for Reparations”.“Whoa, somebody has been studying hard at woke night school!” Noah commented. And though “you shouldn’t have to read Roots to know that blackface is wrong”, Noah said, you have to give credit to Northam “for trying to learn and improve”.But Northam is the “the Michael Scott of politics” – a reference to Steve Carrell’s well-intentioned yet chronically cringe-y character from The Office – and he continued to land in hot water in the King interview, Northam referred to slaves brought to Virginia in 1619 as “indentured servants”.“That’s a nice way to say slavery”, Noah said. “What do you call blackface, ‘extreme tanning?’ What do you call AIDS, ‘permanent flu’? What do you call a tsunami, ‘Aquaman in 3D?’”That didn’t surprise Noah. “It makes total sense”, he said. “Think about it – to black people, especially in Virginia, every white guy serving in office has probably done some racist shit in their past. So you might as well have a white guy who has already been caught and feels bad about it – because you know that guy is never messing up again – and now he has a racism debt that he has to pay off.”White guilt could be “very useful,” Noah said – possible leverage for better schools, criminal justice reform or a holiday on Beyoncé’s birthday.On Late Night, Seth Meyers turned to the 2020 campaign trail, where a historic number of women – six – have entered the race. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota announced her bid in a snow-covered rally this weekend – weather that Trump confused, of course, with evidence refuting climate change.“Why do we have to keep explaining to the president of the United States that weather and climate are two different things?” Meyers asked. “We live in a country where science teachers have to tell their students, ‘I don’t care what the president said.’”Trump also lashed out at Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Twitter this weekend in a tweet, he referenced her specious history of claiming Native American heritage and said he would see her “on the campaign TRAIL” – seemingly a reference to the Trail of Tears, the forced removal and genocide of thousands of Cherokees under President Andrew Jackson in the 1830s. Many called foul on the tweet, though some prominent conservatives claimed it couldn’t be a racist reference because, well, Trump doesn’t know about the Trail of Tears.“They’re actually defending Trump by saying he’s too dumb to be racist,” Meyers said, exasperated. He wasn’t buying it, either. “If you ever find yourself asking is Trump dumb or is he racist, the answer is most likely C, all of the above.”On the Late Show, Colbert focused on the very public smackdown between National Enquirer CEO and Trump ally David Pecker and “world’s wealthiest cage-free egg”, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Last week, Bezos published emails from the National Enquirer which threatened to publish seminude photos of the billionaire if he didn’t publicly state that there were no political motivations his unflattering coverage in the tabloid. Bezos titled his blog post “No thank you, Mr Pecker,” which is also “exactly how I feel about seeing Jeff Bezos’s penis”, joked Colbert.Bezos said he committed whatever budget necessary to find how the intimate text messages got in the hands of the National Enquirer. The investigation has brought up some familiar names: Michael Sanchez, brother of Bezos’s girlfriend, is a close friend of disgraced Trump associate and over-dresser Roger Stone. “Come on, would Roger Stone really stoop to a phone hack or blackmail?” Colbert commented. “That would take away valuable time he could spend bulldozing a dog orphanage in a Disney movie.”Bezos believes the blackmail was political, calling his ownership of the Washington Post a situational “complexifier”.“I think Jeff Bezos just redefinified a brandastical new wordity,” said Colbert. Good news, Colbert said, because after “manhood” and “sexts”, “I think the best euphemism for penis is ‘complexifier’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92826351149af4c8b6f5e96e833d34e5fcfb4feb/0_31_4789_2872/master/4789.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63491420b1de71e46c97bb227eb72059","title":"electric cars already cheaper own run study","story":"Petrol and diesel vehicles cost more over four years in UK and four other European nationsElectric cars are already cheaper to own and run than petrol or diesel alternatives in five European countries analysed in new research.The study examined the purchase, fuel and tax costs of Europe’s bestselling car, the VW golf, in its battery electric, hybrid, petrol and diesel versions. Over four years, the pure electric version was the cheapest in all places – UK, Germany, France, Netherlands and Norway – owing to a combination of lower taxes, fuel costs and subsidies on the purchase price.Researchers from the International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT) said their report showed that tax breaks are a key way to drive the rollout of electric vehicles and tackle climate change and air pollution.Carbon emissions from transport are a big contributor to global warming, but have been rising in recent years in the European Union. Vehicles are also a source of much air pollution, which causes 500,000 early deaths a year in the EU.Sandra Wappelhorst, from the ICCT, said: “Most trips are within an electric vehicle’s range, and it is the battery electric vehicle that turns out to be the most cost effective over four years. But if you’re a country doctor, who might have to respond to emergency calls at odd hours in odd places, you’ll have to evaluate a battery electric car differently to a London surgeon.”Wappelhorst said financial incentives for electric cars would not be needed when purchase prices fall to that of fossil-fuel powered cars, which is likely between 2025 and 2030. “It will happen, because battery costs are dropping and that means that the initial price of the vehicles will drop as well,” she added.Cost is not the only factor, Wappelhorst said. While electric car owners can also benefit from reduced parking and road toll charges, they need to be confident there are sufficient charging points. Regulation is also needed to push car manufacturers toward low-emission vehicles, she said.The analysis showed plug-in hybrid vehicles were often the most expensive to run over four years, in part due to the higher purchase of vehicles that in effect have two engines.James Tate, at the University of Leeds, and colleagues published a study in December 2017 looking at the costs of motoring in the UK, US and Japan. It focused on depreciation and fuel costs and also found electric cars were cheapest: electricity much is less expensive than petrol or diesel.Tate said the UK government could do more to drive the growth of electric cars. “My view is that the UK should do much more to steer the market away from the most polluting and inefficient cars, ie SUVs4x4 which are continuing to grow in sales,” he said. “These large, heavy vehicles burden us and the climate with unnecessary CO2 and air pollutants. A taxation policy that rises with fuel consumption rates, such as in the Netherlands and Norway is overdue.”UK taxation does increase with emissions for company cars, but not for privately owned ones.Tate said carmakers, still reeling from the diesel emissions scandal, were struggling to keep up. “Demand for electric vehicles is out-stripping supply. Manufacturers are scaling up production and developing new models, but have been caught out by the rapid change in the market.”Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: “The UK government’s enthusiasm for electric cars is clear, but it must ensure its policies are clear and consistent so private and fleet buyers can make purchasing decisions that aren’t undermined by policy shifts further down the road.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

PSG meanwhile are in the midst of an injury crisis. Edinson Cavani isn’t expected to shake off a hip problem, Thomas Meunier is concussed, and Neymar is out with a broken metatarsal. And their form suddenly isn’t all that: they’ve recently lost their first league game of the season, to Lyon, and required extra time to get past third-tier Villefranche-Beaujolais in the cup.United will raise a glass to all that they’re now favourites to seize the initiative in this tie tonight. Still, they won’t be counting chickens. They’ve only won once at Old Trafford in Europe this season, scraping 1-0 past Young Boys, drawing 0-0 with Valencia and losing 1-0 to Juventus. And they were beaten at home at this stage last year by Sevilla. They’ll be hoping the all-new Ole football brings that sticky run to an end. But PSG have their own worries, having tumbled out at this stage in the last two seasons, thrashed by Real Madrid last year, humiliated by Barcelona’s greatest-ever comeback in 2017. With their squad stretched, plenty rests on young Kylian Mbappe’s shoulders tonight.So here we go, then, the business end of the Champions League. It’s deliciously poised, with traditional giants hosting one of the tournament favourites. It’s another big European night at Old Trafford. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8798102a25f2a29069a71097278fd28ea151e25f/0_240_4522_2713/master/4522.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a60b77db4831067f131a5f1ec96c5b","title":"roma v porto champions league last 16 first leg live","story":"Hello. The latter stages of the Champions League: a funny place to be if you aren’t one of the super clubs. Shocks are rare in this competition and unpredictability is limited. If you don’t have hundreds of millions to chuck around every summer, you can probably forget about winning it. If you don’t have elite players, history suggests there’s only so far you can go.But it is a knockout competition, so you never know, and both of these sides will reckon they have a fine chance of making the quarter-finals. Having finished second in their group, Roma must be pretty relieved not to have landed one of your Barcelonas or your Bayern Munichs or your PSGS. Having finished top of theirs, Porto must be pretty pleased to have avoided your Liverpools, your Atletico Madrids, your Manchester Uniteds. It’s all to play for at the Stadio Olimpico this evening!And it’s also very hard to call. Trying to pick a favourite isn’t easy. Porto, top of the Portuguese league by a point and unbeaten since October, will be happy to have the second leg at home and Sergio Concecaio will feel confident that he has enough experience and firepower at his disposal to reach the last eight. But while Roma are having a sticky season domestically - Eusebio Di Francesco’s side are sixth in Serie A after an inconsistent run of results and lost 7-1 to Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia last month – the Italians knocked out Barcelona on their way to reaching the last four last season and should represent a step up in class for Porto, who topped a group containing Galatasaray, Lokomotiv Moscow and Schalke. In conclusion: anything could happen. Which is just how it should be.Kick-off: 8pm GMT, 9pm in Rome.

Her battle to bring parliament into the 21st century is far from wonAs the saying goes, if you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans. The vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal was to take place on Tuesday 15 January. Due to gestational diabetes, Siddiq was advised to have a caesarean section at 37 weeks – on the same day. Denied a proxy vote, she had two options: she could have been “nodded through” – a weird process in which two Labour whips and one Tory look at you, exchange glances with one another in mutual assurance that you are alive and of sound mind, and then you go home – but she still would have had to turn up at parliament. She could have “paired” with an MP from an opposite party whose vote would have counteracted her own, but she discussed that in a cross-party new-mum-MP WhatsApp group. The Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson had her pairing betrayed by Conservative MP Brandon Lewis while she was on maternity leave in July. “Jo just said: ‘I really wouldn’t trust them. You don’t understand how I felt, breastfeeding my newborn and seeing the pairing had been broken.’” The only way to guarantee her vote would be recorded was to be there in person. So she delayed her surgery.Seeing Siddiq arrive in a wheelchair caused public outrage – a reminder of how archaic our parliamentary system is that it wouldn’t allow a woman who had been scheduled to have a baby a proxy vote. “Why,” Siddiq asks, “do we expect women to change to suit arcane institutions? Why can’t institutions change?” The scene of her being wheeled into parliament by her husband, then taken into the lobby by Labour MP Clive Lewis (“He’s an army man, he was shooing everyone out of the way”) brought something human to the house – and not just from her own party. Tory MPs David Davis and Nicholas Soames offered solidarity – they expressed great regret at her predicament, and said it wasn’t what they would wish for their own wives. Then came the prime minister. “She was about to lose the most important vote of her life, and she came over and said: ‘I’m really sorry you’re in this position I regret we couldn’t offer you proxy voting.’ As much as I think she has made policy that has ruined some women’s lives, it was a very humane thing to do.”The next day, she was granted a proxy vote, the first person in history to be allowed this. Not long after, a year-long trial to allow MPs proxy votes in the case of maternity leave, paternity leave or adoption was announced. Siddiq is stoic, and describes her medical interactions in a doughty, mischievous spirit, where people advise her to rest and there are just 17 things she has to do first. But haring into Westminster the day before a C-section was, plainly, very stressful. “You can’t eat for a certain amount of time, they clean your stomach. I should really have been preparing for all that. Instead, what do I do? I’m sitting in a cab, to go to parliament and have this surreal experience.”We have this conversation as her baby son, Raphael, lies on her, sleeping. The tableau brings out an intense protectiveness, not because he is so cute, or because she is 4ft 11in, but because he is three weeks old, and she is talking in this completely open, unguarded way and, never mind whether or not the concept of nappy brain is a misogynist conspiracy, it seems incredibly unfair to hold anyone to anything they say, three weeks after they have just had a child, let alone write it down. But she has a superb confidence, born, I think, partly because her constituency is in her bones. She has been a member of Hampstead and Kilburn Constituency Labour party since she was 15 (she is now 36). The seat was held by Glenda Jackson for 23 years, and when she stood for selection Siddiq was advised: “Why don’t you change your name to Tulip Percy?” – her husband’s surname. “There was a real feeling from the outside that the Jewish community wasn’t going to accept me,” she says. A feeling that she knew was wrong, having canvassed with them since she was in her teens. When Jo Cox was murdered, “It was the rabbis who were the first to call me, to see how they could help. I actually do my advice surgeries at JW3 (a Jewish community centre) now, because they have their own security.” As vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group against antisemitism, her line on the continuing row is: “People who were problematic to begin with, 10 years ago, are still there and they still cause problems. It’s the same cranks with renewed energy.” Being a home-grown MP, she is much more open and less worried that she’ll get it wrong than other (albeit talented) MPs who have been parachuted in. Siddiq resigned from the front bench when she refused to vote to trigger article 50. She wants a public vote, and, oh, God, the relief of hearing an MP who actually cares about EU nationals, even while she won’t get any votes from them. “I have realised that I have it a lot easier,” she says. “I’m a staunch remainer and my constituency is staunch remain. It’s very different for me than it is for Stephen Kinnock or Ed Miliband.”Siddiq is from as near as dammit to a political dynasty, just not British politics. Her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, is the prime minister of Bangladesh her grandfather, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was the country’s first president, assassinated in 1975. That is not to say she was raised as a future leader. “My mother was quite discouraging, initially. She was traumatised by what had happened to her father.” It does seem to have given her quite a Teflon attitude, which she has needed, since this connection is also the source of great controversy. Hasina has been repeatedly criticised by human rights groups internationally for claims of political disappearances, detentions without trial, threats by security forces associated with her regime, essentially the hallmarks of a police state. Siddiq, for her part, has been called upon to intervene (by writers in this newspaper), which led to a splenetic exchange with a Channel 4 producer. “Thanks, Daisy, for coming,” she said to the pregnant Daisy Ayliffe, after a reporter asked about Ahmad bin Quasem, a British-trained barrister detained in Bangladesh. “Hope you have a great birth because child labour is hard.” She had to apologise. Now, she says, “I was just trying to humanise the situation, because it had got very heated. It seemed like a good time to say, ‘look, we’re both human beings’.” I wondered what she would say when I ask about her aunt: would she deny the strength of her relationship with her? It would be difficult since Hasina came to her maiden speech in parliament. “I’m personally close to my aunt,” she says. “She was the first to call when this baby was born. She loves the kids. She says I’m like her own daughter.” There is an inconsistency, she points out, that Kinnock (whose wife is the former Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt) never gets asked to intervene in Danish politics in the way that she has with Bangladeshi politics. “You don’t get to be where she is by listening to your niece on national security issues,” says Siddiq. “There are two words she’d say to me: ‘Fuck off.’ People need to realise the limitations that I have, how far removed I am from it. When they ask me to intervene, it makes me look a lot more powerful than I am.”There is clearly a remainer, left-but-not-Corbyn-loyal group of MPs in the Labour party, and I would say Siddiq was in it. But one of the lesser-remarked consequences of the current mess is that only the very obvious cliques and outriders are visible – you can’t really see new political talent coming together. It is hard to say how organised they are – do they even have a WhatsApp group? “Not for left-remainers. But there’s a Women’s PLP group, a BAME one, there’s the 2015 intake, and conversations about Brexit happen in those.”Siddiq, for her part, is not taking maternity leave. She was doing casework when her baby was three days old: “That won’t wait, I can’t get a researcher to do it and it’s a privilege to be an MP, I don’t resent that.” (Arguably, she could get a researcher to do casework. But feelings of indispensability are not unique among MPs.) She has been asked how long she wants the proxy vote for: “I haven’t given a straight answer, because I have to see what happens in March,” she says.Saddiq is comically driven, saying of her husband: “I made him change his career to support mine. So now he’s a freelance consultant in education. Which basically means he can pick up the kids.” It’s the same mix of self-parody and deadly seriousness you can hear in her assessment of the last few weeks: “I’m dragging parliament into the 21st century, from my hospital bed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27bbf9b0d0daa06509a2a4754fcd1c587b3b777a/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb389ec78b5ae255879f3efbe6727616","title":"four day working week share your experiences and views","story":"We would like to explore the idea from your perspective, whether you are an employee, employer or policy expertMoving to a four day week: is it the ideal way to achieve a better work-life balance or simply a luxury incompatible with the modern world?

By  Olivier van BeemenThe first time Heineken amazed me was in Tunisia, in early 2011, when I was covering the Jasmine revolution and the fall of President Ben Ali for a Dutch business newspaper. During my reporting, I discovered that Heineken maintained close ties with the kleptocratic family clan that had ruled Tunisia for almost 25 years. It was not just the relationship itself that had me stunned – it was the fact that Heineken was brewing beer there at all. I knew the company was doing business all over the world, and I had some vague notion that it would have breweries outside the Netherlands, but I had never realised the scale: 165 breweries in more than 70 countries, including this north African autocracy.The following year, I decided to begin work on a book about Heineken’s operations in Africa. When I told people in the Netherlands about my plan, I was mostly regaled with positive stories. A woman who had done an internship at Heineken told me she chose to apply to the company because of its corporate social responsibility, and she waxed lyrical about “the combination of idealism and no-nonsense business”. I went through Dutch news archives and found enthusiastic stories about the company’s work in Africa, with headlines like “Heineken is Helping”.In total, I spent six years researching Heineken in Africa. On my first few reporting trips, I was suitably impressed. As a Dutchman, you inevitably feel a certain pride when you are far away from home and notice how popular “our” brands are. The company, which has operated in Africa since the 1930s, likes to present itself as a dynamic enterprise that has achieved remarkable success on a commercially challenging continent, where many countries struggle with bad infrastructure, low education levels, corruption and political instability.But I started having misgivings early on. In the company archives, I discovered that in the early 1960s Heineken was an ardent supporter of a “white bloc” of southern African countries, including Rhodesia, South Africa and the two Portuguese colonies Angola and Mozambique. I learned that in South Africa a senior manager urged his colleagues not to act “in opposition to the letterspirit of apartheid”, and I also read about the enormous amounts of money that Heineken channelled from Africa into a subsidiary in Switzerland, taking away an important source of fiscal revenue from the governments of newly formed independent states.While travelling around the continent, I heard about free crates of beer given to elites in Burundi, I saw little schools in Nigeria with beer logos painted on the walls, and I witnessed the misery of the drinking dens in the South African township of Soweto. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), I saw the worryingly cosy relationship between the brewery’s PR department and local journalists. These issues turned out not to be incidental, but formed part of a pattern.In time, I began to realise that Heineken’s references to the difficulties of operating in Africa, however real, form part of a narrative in which the company’s own achievements are enlarged and responsibility for its wrongdoing lies elsewhere. The message is that it is actually nothing short of a miracle that this beer brewer can operate under such difficult circumstances and, along the way, does so many good things for the people and planet.What is absent from the narrative is that some of the apparent difficulties Heineken faces in Africa can also be surprisingly useful. Consider, for example, weak governments that fail to maintain roads and healthcare, obliging the company to find costly solutions – clearly an obstacle for business, one would think. But at the same time, lawlessness in many countries enables Heineken to sell and advertise its drinks without the hassle of regulation. Levels of education are often low, which can be a hindrance when looking for qualified personnel – but also a blessing in disguise when there is information to be spread about the supposed “positive” properties of beer.“Don’t turn this into a crusade against Heineken. You’re too young for that,” Van Boxmeer warned me during our first meeting. I can reassure him. This is not an indictment of Heineken specifically, but a study of the ways one multinational in Africa operates. As far as I have been able to determine, the Dutch beer brewer’s behaviour resembles that of its competitors and other western companies in many respects. My aim is to provide an accurate image of a company that likes to blow its own trumpet regarding its supposed African success story – a story for which it has been lavishly praised, both inside the Netherlands and on the international stage, at the UN general assembly.In its code of conduct, Heineken describes its workers as “our greatest assets”. So what is working for Heineken in Africa really like? Not bad, at first sight. Across the continent, I have met former employees who look back with pride on their careers – no matter whether they were carrying crates or running the brewery. Most of Heineken’s staff members in Africa are on relatively low salaries by local standards, but Heineken compensates for this by being an attentive and encouraging employer.“As a simple operator, you don’t earn much,” says a former Rwandan manager whose first job was as a maintenance engineer. “But supervisors and higher staff are well paid, and when I started out there were many more managerial roles available, compared to other companies. If you do your work well, you get recognised and promoted.” For successful employees, there are also status-enhancing perks such as company cars or tablet devices. Employees also appreciate the wide range of training courses on offer.For most of Heineken’s staff in Africa, there is no pension scheme, but at the end of their careers they are often entitled to a good severance package. Some use the money to start their own company. I found former employees who had started a fish farm, a consultancy business and a bakery. Others had stayed faithful to their old line of work and opened a bar.One group of employees gets fussed over more than most: expats. Very often, the company maintains rent-free luxury villas on or near local Heineken premises, for expatriate staff. The number of African managers has risen across the continent as a whole, but in most countries white staff remain at the top of the pecking order. (At the time of writing, nine out of 13 African subsidiaries are headed by Europeans, and four by Africans.) According to Heineken’s 2014 annual report, entry-level employees at Nigerian Breweries got a little over $2,000 per year (£1,500), while the company spent the same amount every day on a Dutch director in Nigeria – not counting the bonuses.In its operations across Africa, Heineken uses subcontractors and zero-hour workers increasingly often. In many countries, the income of a day labourer or a temporary worker does not amount to the “decent standard of living” that the company says is its goal. A cleaner in DRC cannot survive on a monthly salary of $40-50, and even a security guard who makes three times as much will find it hard to make ends meet. Moreover, external workers have no rights to healthcare or other services. In theory, it is the agencies that hire them that must provide these, but failure to do so does not tend to stop Heineken from working with them.In Lubumbashi, a city in DRC, I met a temporary worker who told me he was not allowed to take a break. “When the directors leave for lunch, the staff just keep working,” he said. “We were supposed to get a canteen, but the budget for that has been cut. They don’t have the whip like they used to in colonial times, but the pressure of work is too much and bears no relation to our salaries.”He said he laughs out loud at the slogan of Fondation Bralima, Heineken’s local charity: “Committed to the wellbeing of the Congolese.” His conclusion: “Let them start with the wellbeing of their own workers.”If there is one group to whom the temp’s last words should apply, it is the “beer promotion girls”, young women who are hired to help boost sales in bars. In 2000, a group of aid organisations in Cambodia sounded the alarm about the risks promotion women faced in doing their job. They spoke of promotion women as being akin to “indirect sex workers” who earned very little and were often harassed, pressured into having sex with customers and ran the risk of contracting HIV.Heineken set up an internal working group to tackle the problem in Asia. “It was difficult because these girls were not directly employed by us and turnover was large,” recalls former HR manager Hans Wesseling.Katinka van Cranenburgh, a former Heineken executive, who took responsibility for the issue within HR, says it wasn’t until an important shareholder lodged a complaint that any significant action was taken. “Internally, we appealed to morality and the rights of women, but we saw that an angry letter from an investor yielded better results,” she says. Heineken issued a series of guidelines entitled Promotion Girls Policy: Selling Beer Safely. Henceforth, the young women would receive training, and the company promised to try to ensure better working conditions.As early as 2003, according to internal documents, Heineken became aware that similar problems were occurring in Africa. A spokesman at the time commented in a Dutch daily: “It’s nothing special. It’s like the girls you used to see walking on the streets in the Netherlands, giving away free magazines for a private broadcaster and wearing a dress with its logo.”Wesseling, who worked at Heineken from 1991 until 2005, says: “We had promotion girls in Africa. We knew this, in spite of internal denials. It was extra problematic because we had been running a very successful Aids policy in Africa.” From 2001, HIV-positive Heineken workers in Africa and their immediate families had been offered free therapy for life, which would continue after retirement or redundancy. Therapy always came with counselling, free condoms and HIV tests – and Heineken’s treatment of its workers won praise and admiration across the world, including among US politicians. “It gave our people in the US a great story,” said Wesseling. “So nobody was going to kill that image with African promotion girls having to sell our beer under the direst of circumstances. Better to frame that as a local custom: ‘That’s how they do things over there.’”In 2007, an internal inquiry showed that Heineken was using about 15,000 promotion women globally, mostly in non-western countries. No fewer than 70 markets were considered risky for the promotion women because the work involved or could lead to sexual abuse, low pay or being forced to wear provocative uniforms. Sixteen of those markets were in Africa: circumstances were least favourable there, and Heineken was said to use almost 2,000 promotion women. According to internal documentation, only one African market was problem-free.The person who Heineken chose to conduct this research was a 21-year-old intern, lending weight to the notion that the brewer did not consider this a subject of great importance. “I was a little taken aback that they asked me for such a delicate and important subject,” says the former intern, Diego Centurion.What did Bralima, the Congolese subsidiary of Heineken, get out of this in terms of extra sales? “I don’t think they were that valuable,” says a former director in DRC. “It was a mess. When this thing was going on in Cambodia, we also got rules, but they did not change a great deal. For a while, management hired taxis to get the girls home at night, but eventually they decided this was too expensive. Those girls were getting less than the minimum wage, and they were used by Bralima personnel. Very often these were girls with problems, very vulnerable. Given that we paid them so very little, they were virtually forced to go home with a man.”Stefaan van der Borght, Heineken’s former director for global health affairs, says that at one point Heineken tried promotion boys: “We wanted to take away the association with sex, but it didn’t work. Another problem was that we used subcontractors, for reasons of flexibility. Sometimes you needed a lot of girls, for parties, and at other times it was quiet. So you were burdening these subcontractors with the workload and the social obligations, while Heineken was held accountable.”Promotion women in DRC and Nigeria continue to work under the most dreadful conditions. “Every evening I am touched against my will. It doesn’t matter whether I work in an expensive cafe or a popular bar,” says Peace, a promotion girl in Lagos. Her colleague Sylvia adds: “We learn how to handle this. During the instruction, they tell us there will be annoying men. But you have to tolerate them because you are trying to increase sales and make the brand stronger.”“We learn that we should not respond aggressively or say ‘stop’. By walking away, you let them know that it’s not appreciated,” says Peace.But what if someone continues? Is there someone there, from the agency hiring the women, someone they can talk to? “Yes there is, sometimes, but often not,” she continues. “It is a public space, so there will be no rapes. That can only happen when the girls go with the customers. But that is a choice. Our employer thinks: if you don’t like being fondled, you must look for other work. I don’t even notice it any more. I anticipate it.”The women’s incomes differ from one agency to another, and on average, at the time of this research, they earn about $8 per day. In an expensive city like Lagos, this is not much, but it tallies with other forms of unskilled work.A lot of women take the risk of sleeping with the customers. Peace and Sylvia think that at least half of their colleagues are doing this. “These girls can’t support themselves and they are desperate. This is the way they earn much more money,” said Peace. And what do the employers think? Are they trying to prevent it?“No, definitely not,” says Sylvia. “They like it when you act like this because it helps sales.”Peace agrees: “They keep girls like that because they bring many customers.”In Lagos alone, hundreds or possibly thousands of promotion women are used to sell Heineken brands. The situation in Nigeria is not exceptional. According to a well-connected source, there are at least 100 women active in Kinshasa, captial of DRC, and an unknown number in other Congolese cities.“Of course these girls are harassed, they are filles à tout faire (girls you can do anything with). It’s part of the profession,” says one Kinshasa salesman who used to work with the women. He calls them “whores” before continuing: “Sometimes Bralima uses real prostitutes because they know how to seduce a customer, and that’s advantageous. But others are stricter and draw a line the customer must not cross. They have a difficult time because if you work in a bar you are considered a public girl. The brewery doesn’t care about them.”Even for other Heineken staff in Africa, being a woman is not always easy. According to a number of people I spoke to, across the continent, ambitious women sometimes have to get intimate with the HR manager – usually a local member of staff – to get a job or secure a promotion. Expats at management level know the rumours, but rarely consider it their priority to bring the issue to attention.Wesseling, the former HR manager, says: “We knew that during the 1990s, things were happening in Congo that were beyond the pale. We had a very powerful HR manager who maintained a selection procedure that would not be accepted here. Women had to provide sexual services to get a job.” Heineken’s current CEO, Van Boxmeer, was general manager of Bralima from 1993 to 1996. But according to Wesseling, “he did not act when he was general manager there”.Other insiders told stories of expat managers in Africa a handing out jobs to their girlfriends. The Rwandan girlfriend of a top manager in DRC became the fuel supplier for one of their breweries even though the previous one was cheaper and more reliable, according to those in the know. In Nigeria, an expat director gave secretarial jobs to two of his conquests, for which they were entirely unqualified, according to colleagues. And one national director allegedly asked for female staff he wanted for himself to first be sent to the medical department in order to have an Aids test.When my book on Heineken was published in the Netherlands last year, the Dutch parliament passed a motion calling on the current minister for development and foreign trade, Sigrid Kaag, to get tough on abuses within or by Dutch business abroad. The abuse of promotion women had direct consequences for the company. The Global Fund, supported by Bill Gates, suspended cooperation with Heineken because of the scandal, and the Dutch ASN Bank, following a third inquiry, removed Heineken from its sustainable investment fund and has halted all other financial involvement with the company until further notice.Heineken revised an earlier declaration in which it had claimed that the company employed just 200 promotion women in two countries in Africa. An internal inquiry now revealed an estimated 4,000 women in 13 countries. The company announced a series of measures: clear and unambiguous rules, training, dress codes, no alcohol on the job and transport home after work. These are, almost word-for-word, the same measures that were put in a policy paper in 2004, which remained an empty promise.But this time, Heineken said, things really would be different. So, in March 2018, the company made a firm promise that reassured some politicians and stakeholders. “If we can’t guarantee good working conditions for our promoters in certain markets by the end of June, we’ll stop employing them there.”In the summer of 2018, I went to Kenya to see for myself whether Heineken had kept its word this time. Was I even surprised? I met with six promotion women, who all told me the same stories: nothing had changed. They still had to accept sexual harassment as part of the job, their uniforms were so short it made them feel like prostitutes, and some of them were forced to sleep with their bosses. In an interview with a Dutch newspaper a few months later, Van Boxmeer called my reporting on the promotion women “exaggerated”, without specifying why. “We cannot be responsible if a customer treats a promoter inappropriately,” he said. “We can’t control everything.”Freddy Heineken, the company’s legendary CEO, who died in 2002, used to say: “People don’t drink beer. They drink marketing.” He understood that selling beer successfully is a matter of psychology. It’s about image and an emotion. For many years, Heineken’s image has remained largely untroubled by the reality of its operations in Africa. “I can tell you from the bottom of my heart that here at Heineken we want to improve things and want to contribute positively to the societies where we operate,” one member of staff at Heineken’s head office in Amsterdam told me. “We try to stick to all the rules, however difficult that may be. I am hurt that this is trivialised with remarks that suggest it is all just commerce and marketing to us. It is very difficult to be an island of perfection in a sea of misery, but please, do not doubt our sincerity.”Heineken as an “island of perfection”. And Africa, where Heineken has made billions in the past century? “A sea of misery.” But, of course, we should not doubt Heineken’s sincerity.Translated by Bram Posthumus.

The talks are at a crucial stage. We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this house requires and deliver Brexit on time.”The main update provided by the prime minister was confirmation that the amendable motion on Brexit to be debated on Thursday will reflect the words of the Brady measure. She also confirmed that if no revised deal was ready to be voted on by 27 February, a further amendable motion would be tabled.Answering questions afterwards, May laid open the possibility that a meaningful vote might take place well into March, announcing that a usual waiting period for international agreements to be ratified would be potentially waived.Dominic Grieve, the Tory MP and former attorney general, asked May how a departure date of 29 March would work with a vote taken at the end of February or later, given that the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act dictates that treaties cannot be ratified without a waiting period of 21 Commons sitting days.May said: “Where there’s insufficient time remaining following the successful meaningful vote we will make provision in the withdrawal agreement bill, with parliament’s consent, to ensure that we’re able to ratify on time to guarantee our exit in an orderly way.”In the statement, May reiterated her rejection of a customs union, which was one of five demands made by Corbyn if she wanted Labour to back her deal. She said a customs union would prevent the UK from signing its own trade deals and was “a less desirable outcome than that which is provided for in the political declaration”.The prime minister made a fresh appeal to potentially wavering Labour MPs by stressing her post-Brexit commitment to environmental and workers’ rights, reiterating an offer made in her response to Corbyn that parliament could vote on whether to match any future EU changes in these areas.In response, Corbyn accused May of playing for time and having no plan. “Our country is facing the biggest crisis in a generation, and yet this prime minister continues to recklessly run down the clock,” he said.“We were promised there would be a deal last October – that didn’t happen. We were promised a meaningful vote on a deal in December – that didn’t happen. We were told to prepare for a further meaningful vote this week after the prime minister again promised to secure significant and legally binding changes to the backstop – and that hasn’t happened.”May’s only plan, Corbyn said, was “to run down the clock hoping members of this house are blackmailed into supporting a deeply flawed deal. This is an irresponsible act. She is playing for time and playing with people’s jobs, our economic security and the future of our industry.”An already bad-tempered debate was held up briefly when Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, was heard calling May a “liar” as she responded to one of his points about publishing economic analyses. It is forbidden under Commons rules to accuse other MPs of deliberate dishonesty.The Speaker, John Bercow, on being told what Blackford had said, told him to withdraw the accusation “at once”. Blackford told Bercow: “In courtesy to yourself, I withdraw.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dffbab36a739cb8b4e0f70f79d12ae15788a644a/2_0_7107_4267/master/7107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82b74f126dd1076a801fdb044779eaa1","title":"un big mess how rest of europe views brexit","story":"Seven correspondents report on how the UK’s political upheaval has affected its image on the continentThe comment slipped out after a long, geeky conversation about Brexit’s potential impact on Ireland’s trade, employment, banking and consumer confidence. “You know, we’d almost forgotten how good it felt to stick it to the Brits.” The speaker shrugged and grinned. “Old habits.”This was not a grizzled Sinn Féin party activist in west Belfast, but a young business professional in a cafe near the Dublin headquarters of Facebook and Google – the heart of new, globalised Ireland. Yet here was an admission – a declaration – of schadenfreude echoing down from a centuries-old resentment at the colonial master who came and stayed for 800 years.I hear it from officials, shopkeepers, academics, truckers, artists and students: the Irish government is right to insist on the backstop, and if that gives Britain’s ruling class an aneurysm, well, grab some popcorn and enjoy the spectacle.A tendency to enjoy the neighbour’s discomfort had faded in recent decades. John Major and Tony Blair earned respect for the Good Friday agreement. The Irish economy took off. There was a sense of a fresh start in Anglo-Irish relations.In the centenary year of Ireland’s war of independence, Brexit seems to have turned the clock back.But it hasn’t, not really. There is some relish at Westminster’s convulsions – the parliament of Oliver Cromwell reduced to Benny Hill. But the overwhelming emotion is worry that Britain will crash out of the EU without a deal, wreaking havoc on Ireland’s economy and destabilising Northern Ireland.And there is also sadness. A once-valued diplomatic partner, a neighbour with whom Ireland shares myriad cultural commonalities, is turning away. Glee at Westminster dysfunction is, it seems, an attempt to extract solace from a sense that Britain doesn’t care about breaking Irish hearts.“Brexit has damaged so many ways of doing business,” says Eunan O’Halpin, a history professor at Trinity College Dublin. “There is a sense that with the British unless it’s written down, you can’t trust anything they say.” Rory Carroll“It’s a mixture of bemusement and bewilderment,” says Michiel van Hulten, a former MEP. “On one level it’s entertaining, great spectacle. A pantomime you can’t stop watching. As you know, we love British comedy. Except this isn’t Monty Python, it’s your politicians.”In June 1667, Samuel Pepys recorded an English MP spluttering: “I think the Devil shits Dutchmen,” after the Dutch fleet sailed merrily up the Medway and trashed the pride of the Royal Navy.Anglo-Dutch relations have come a long way since then. Politically, minds met in the EU: pragmatic, and distrusting of a Franco-German stitch-up. In business, dual-nationals Shell and Unilever flourished more than 80,000 Dutch companies now trade with the UK.And the people? The Dutch master English like none other admire and consume British culture in quantity adore British humour. The Brits were people the Dutch could relate to. Then came Brexit.It’s bewildering, says Van Hulten. “We had such a close relationship. For a whole postwar generation, the UK was a shining example. People just cannot fathom that a country that played such a vital role internationally, and in Europe, cannot even manage its own affairs.”Thijs van den Berg, an Amsterdam English teacher, says he feels rejected. “As with any ex-lover, you now dislike what used to attract you. We liked your eccentricity because we knew at heart you were serious. Now you don’t look serious at all. Those jokes, that posturing – it just looks silly. Irresponsible.”But mainly, a country they once felt they knew has become a mystery. When parliament sent Theresa May back to Brussels to renegotiate, the Dutch paper Trouw described it thus: “It’s a bit like the crew of the Titanic deciding, by majority vote, that the iceberg really must get out of the way.” Jon HenleySpain may be preoccupied with domestic issues – the landmark trial of Catalan independence leaders and the sudden eruption of the far-right, to name only two – but the Brexit pantomime continues to fascinate, confuse and appal.Spaniards, who have long viewed British politics as an ancient beacon of democracy and informed debate, are struggling to reconcile their ideal with the realities of recent days, weeks and months.“We’ve always had a bit of a complex – always thought our democracy was more imperfect because it was younger than that of France, the UK or Germany,” says Marta García Aller, a journalist with the online newspaper El Independiente.But the UK political class’s uncanny ability to ensure that Brexit somehow manages to play out as both tragedy and farce has marked a before and an after.“I think most people see it as chaos – and that’s very strange in a country whose people have such a strong reputation for being disciplined and well-organised,” says García Aller.There is, however, little schadenfreude. Spain is devoutly pro-EU and all too aware of how much is at stake. Perhaps that’s why the word that comes up most frequently in relation to Brexit is incertidumbre, or uncertainty.“People are starting to realise that this is all really happening, and worrying about what it will mean for the Spanish economy,” says García Aller.“What’s going to happen with the British tourists who are fundamental to the economy? To the retired Britons who live here? The thousands of Spaniards who work in the UK? We’ve all got a friend or know someone who’s a nurse in a British hospital or a teacher in a British university.”Ignacio Molina, a senior analyst at the Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid, agrees Brexit has disfigured the image of British politics as “moderate, pragmatic and dependable”. In the bungled departure preparations, he sees echoes of the UK’s post-imperial wane.According to Molina, the “systemic failure” of Brexit has called into question the very idea of “the great British democracy. It’s a project that hasn’t been thought through. Even with Trump, there’s a strategy. But with Brexit there’s no strategy and no plan. It’s the most un-British thing there is!” Sam JonesAs Brexit turns into what one French commentator called a “national psychodrama” – or, in the more prosaic words of a friend, “un big mess” – many French are addressing Britons with the sympathy normally reserved for the bereaved. “So sorry,” they say, as a no-deal B-Day looms. “What will you do now?”There is little gloating, much genuine concern, and massive incomprehension. The journalist Pierre Haski sums up Brexit bafflement: “Did electors really vote Brexit to allow the haughty aristocrat Jacob Rees-Mogg or the demagogue Boris Johnson to challenge Theresa May … or for Jeremy Corbyn to get into Downing Street without saying what he will do about Brexit?” It was a genuine question.The Channel tunnel has been key to softening historically fraught Anglo-French relations personal and cultural links have grown richer now that travelling between Paris and London is less traumatic than the average commute.As for the infamous “love-hate” relationship, of late the loathing has been largely one way. Screaming British tabloid headlines accuse France of deliberately orchestrating no-deal mayhem, while in the real world the French government is doing precisely the opposite.Thankfully, the abuse is shrugged off. If there is a response, it is frustration. “We’ve spent hundreds of hours on Brexit – and we do have other things to do,” one French civil servant tells me.Some try to make sense of the Westminster spectacle. Jean-Marc Puissesseau, the president of the company that runs the Calais port – also working hard to avoid Brexit chaos – says there were signs of Brexit years ago. “You had special conditions. You continued to drive on the left, you kept the pound … perhaps Great Britain is so fundamentally insular and protective of its own future and freedom, this is its destiny. But it’s a pity.”Hélène Orain, the director of Paris’s Museum of Immigration, hopes “the links between our countries will not stop, and we can continue to recount our common history”.If there is any silver lining to the present impenetrable Brexit cloud, it may be a growing feeling, for many Britons in France, that behind all the “frog” and “rosbif” nonsense, the French are really quite fond of us. Kim WillsherSigns of Anglophilia are easy to spot in Prague: a square named after Winston Churchill, a bunch of English-language bookshops and several branches of Marks \u0026amp Spencer. Since the Velvet revolution that heralded the end of communism in 1989, most Czech politicians, diplomats and opinion-formers have routinely deferred to Britain as a cradle of democracy and common sense. All this has added to Czechs’ bewilderment at the seemingly chaotic drama unfolding at Westminster as the UK staggers towards the EU departure gate.Jiří Pehe, a political analyst and director at New York University in Prague, recently summed up the mood when he tweeted that politics in Britain had become even worse than its Czech counterpart. “The infantilisation of politics, to say ‘if it’s not my way, it won’t be any other way’, reminds me of Czech politics,” he explains. “We ascribe it to the fact that Czech democracy is so young, and recovering from communism. To see an established democracy like Britain descending into this chaos and irrationality is really disheartening. It’s a very comprehensive defeat for British politics.”Some Czech policymakers worry that Britain’s impending departure from the EU will undermine the Nato alliance. Yet growing awareness of the political paralysis wrought by Brexit may have had one unexpected spin-off – a rise in support for EU membership here, where recorded levels of Euroscepticism have often matched, or even surpassed, those in Britain.In the days after the Brexit vote, Britons would remark that the Germans must be positively swimming in schadenfreude, after we had caused so much trouble in the EU. But among the people I spoke to – government spokespeople, supermarket cashiers, diplomats and taxi drivers – the overwhelming emotions were sadness and disappointment.A diplomat likens his melancholy to that of being dumped by a girlfriend. “I still have her jumper and I go round wearing it, hoping her scent will linger,” he says. He clings to the positive aspects of a Britain he cherished – from punk music to humour – and almost breaks into song: “They can’t take that away from me.”Germans are also resigned – if frustrated - by British misperceptions, from Boris Johnson’s claims that a “German-led” EU is pursuing a Hitlerian superstate to the notion that Berlin would force the EU to submit to the UK’s Brexit demands in order to save the German car industry. They are also immune to the British tabloids’ assertions that Germany is morally indebted to Britain for the defeat of Hitler, and so should throw Theresa May a lifeline.It’s a sign of the affection many Germans harbour for the UK that such feelings have not been dented. Even in their Brexit bewilderment, Germans still love holidaying in the UK, savour our lively parliamentary debate and obsess over the royals. But increasingly, they are coping with Brexit by separating Britain into two entities: cultural and political. Many kick themselves that they did not see it coming some ask what what they can do to help reverse it.But not everyone. A professor of risk assessment tells me the path to Brexit was long clear in Britain’s difficult relationship with the EU. “I think it is time Britain left now,” he says. “It doesn’t help anyone, least of all the British, for them to stay in.”I am one of thousands of Britons living here to have taken German citizenship since the referendum. My book on the process, Exit Brexit, has had an overwhelming response. That a Brit is prepared to embrace historically tarred Germany, in the way lots of Germans have embraced Britain, astonishes many.“If Brexit doesn’t happen, will you keep your German passport?” one interviewer asked. I assured her I have no intention of giving it up. Kate ConnollyPoland’s attitude towards Britain might be characterised as largely affectionate – but with an edge. Brexit is not helping.The wartime alliance is remembered in Poland as much in terms of British betrayals as of Polish pilots and the Enigma machine.Resentment eased during the cold war thanks to Britain’s role as a key adversary of communist Poland’s Soviet overlords, and the emergence – incongruously, for many – of Margaret Thatcher as a heroine of the Polish proletariat.At first, the large-scale migration of Poles– admired for their work ethic and almost universally accepted – to the UK in the 2000s appeared to herald a golden age in relations between the two nations. Many Britons assume the new arrivals were motivated exclusively by money, but many were also attracted by modern British multiculturalism. “I loved the freedom. I remember thinking: ‘This is it! This is my place on earth,’” a Polish woman who moved to the UK in 1999 tells me.That love of Britain has only intensified the pain of rejection after the Brexit vote. Complicating matters further, it is increasingly apparent that many other Poles living in the UK never accepted Britain’s multicultural model in the first place. Feeling rejected and economically exploited, the Polish community is increasingly a recruiting ground for the far right in both countries.There are of course many Poles who still live perfectly happily in the UK, and will continue to do so. But the feeling that they are now being rejected, having once been welcomed, is leading to the return of some old resentments. For many, the love affair with Britain is turning sour.

Here are the key points.The original Cooper bill said that May should be given until Tuesday 26 February to pass a Brexit deal, and that if she did not get one through the Commons by then, at that point she should be obliged to seek an extension of article 50. The amendment that would have created time for that bill to be passed was defeated two weeks ago. This bill would create a new deadline, 15 days later.This bill would require the prime minister and parliament to take crucial decisions by the middle of March at the very latest on whether the UK is leaving with a deal, without a deal or seeking an extension to article 50.It forces the prime minister to tell us whether she wants to leave with no deal or to extend article 50 if she still hasn’t got a deal in place by the middle of March. This bill creates a parliamentary safeguard to prevent us drifting into no deal by accident, and to prevent those crucial decisions being left until the final fortnight. The risks to jobs, the NHS and security from no deal are too great for us to stand back and let the government drift. The prime minister needs to get a workable deal in place quickly and she has asked for more time. But there is a real danger of endless drift so if she can’t get a deal in place by 26th February, our cross party group will put forward this bill at that point to ensure that crucial decisions are made by the middle of March. That is the latest timetable to get the bill through the parliamentary process in time for decisions to be made in March.And, while we’re on the subject of Stephen Barclay, the relatively new Brexit secretary, in an interview today he also got the name of the European commission president wrong, calling him Jean-Paul Juncker, not Jean-Claude. Perhaps not a great start to the renegotiation ....And while he was in Strasbourg, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, refused to say that the changes to the backstop that the UK requires would definitely require the text of the withdrawal agreement to be rewritten, the BBC’s Adam Fleming reports.Two weeks ago Theresa May said the withdrawal agreement would have to be re-opened. But today two of her cabinet ministers, first Andrea Leadsom (see 8.38am) and now Barclay), have implied that that might not be the case, and even May was a bit more wobbly on this in the Commons than she has been previously. (See 4.27pm.)Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, met Theresa May last week and David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, and Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, today. He says the UK does not seem to have a plan to break the Brexit deadlock.These are from Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis on the Brexit timetable.This morning, on the Today programme, Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said that all 600-odd statutory instruments that have to be passed before Brexit on 29 March could get through parliament on time. (See 9.47am.)Ruth Fox, director of the Hansard Society, has written a helpful blog looking at this. Hr conclusion is that Leadsom is probably right - but “potentially at some cost to parliamentary scrutiny”. Ultimately, if the government is running out of time, it can initiate the urgent case procedure set out in the EU (Withdrawal) Act. Under this procedure, ministers can make SIs that come into immediate effect having been ‘made’ (signed-off) by the minister. ‘Made affirmatives’ require both Houses to approve them within 28 days to remain in force.To use this procedure, ministers will simply have to provide a written statement explaining the urgency. In the circumstances, this will not be difficult. Ministers have said that they do not anticipate using the urgent procedure – and if our hunch is correct, and the overall number of Brexit SIs that still need to be laid is lower than expected, they may not need to do so. Nevertheless, it is a useful insurance in the event of problems arising on or near 29 March. This procedure would ensure that all SIs that are required can come into effect on exit day.Here is Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, responding to the Robert Peston blog claiming a no-deal Brexit is now likely. (See 11.54am.)Unionism could be an energetic and energising voice in the debate around Irish unity, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald has said. As the Press Association reports, her comments came after a DUP MLA sent a letter warning unionists they may not be able to vote to keep Northern Ireland in the UK. North Down MLA Alex Easton contacted his constituents asking them to register in case there is a vote on Irish unity. The letter emerged hours after DUP leader Arlene Foster claimed there was no possibility of a border poll. McDonald said people should not “feel anxious” about a border poll. Speaking outside Leinster House in Dublin, she said: People shouldn’t feel a sense of threat around the prospect of a border poll or the debate that will lead into it or the Ireland that will emerge from it. This will be a collaborative and collective process. We won’t write the blueprint for a new united Ireland. Unionism needs to be accommodated and welcomed and become a very energetic and energising voice, and perhaps a challenging voice, in the debate around Irish unity and in the debate around the securing a referendum on that matter.The Labour party has said it will oppose any move by the government to exempt the EU withdrawal agreement from the Constitutional Reform and Governance (CRAG) Act. (See 4.27pm.) In a statement the shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield said:This plan shows contempt for our democracy. The government is trying to avoid proper scrutiny and run down the clock in order to force through its bad Brexit deal.Labour will oppose this change, which would deny parliament full scrutiny."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e908cdc3b70effa3ec46ec3a12ba30e7dac5159/0_2097_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46f6ca81ebc1681fed5689277487ce69","title":"hold social networks responsible for child self harm says nspcc","story":"Proposals backed by Ruth Moss, whose daughter killed herself after seeing suicide imagesFacebook could face fines of more than $2bn for gross breaches of laws being proposed by campaigners aimed at stopping harm to children online.The child protection charity NSPCC has urged ministers to criminalise social media companies who fail to protect children from exposure to material including images of child abuse and which allow grooming. It also wants a new statutory regulator to tackle the availability of images of self-harm, including suicide.The calls are being backed by Ruth Moss, whose daughter Sophie killed herself in 2014, aged 13, having viewed images of suicide and self-harm on social networks including Facebook and Instagram.At the launch of the proposed regulatory regime Moss described how she was devastated by her daughter’s suicide and demonstrated how, more than four years after she died, it still takes just seconds to find images on Facebook of people who have taken their own lives and of self-harm. Moss said she wants to meet Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister who is now Facebook’s vice-president of global affairs in California.“Sophie’s death devastated me,” she said. “No mother, or family, should have to go through that. I found that she had been looking at completely inappropriate things online. Some of the images were so graphic that even as an adult I was shocked.”The NSPCC said a new regulator would:• Have legal powers to investigate tech firms and “lift the lid” on their child safety measures.• Demand social networks build minimum child safety standards into the design of the of their site, for example preventing streaming with strangers, and in their reporting and moderating functions.• Hold platforms responsible for harms that start on their sites but then go on elsewhere.• Hold a director responsible and strike them off if they fail.“We cannot continue to stumble from tragedy to tragedy, issue by issue, with a half-hearted, piecemeal approach from social networks, when it is already too late and a parent has lost a child,” said Peter Wanless, chief executive of NSPCC.“Over the last decade, self-regulation has been tried and found wanting time and time again. Thirteen voluntary codes of conduct have each launched with warm words and good intentions. None have designed essential child protection properly into the online world.“Instead, children have continued to face an unacceptable level of risk right across social networks, with devastating consequences. In the offline world, from toys to playgrounds, we take child safety regulations for granted. Yet online, the most basic child protection remains an optional extra.”The intervention comes amid a growing clamour for restrictions on the material that is available online to children following the death of Molly Russell, 14, who took her own life. Her Instagram account was found to contain distressing material about depression and suicide. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, last week announced that it will ban all graphic self-harm images as part of a series of changes.The government is considering imposing a mandatory code of conduct on tech companies, which could be accompanied by fines for non-compliance, prompting a substantial behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign by social media sites.The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, is due to unveil the government’s proposals at the end of this month.She described how she had allowed her daughter to have a mobile phone when she was being bussed to school. She was suffering from depression and had established a Facebook account using a different name, pretending to be older than she was. She found that her daughter had been looking at disturbing images and also realised she had been online with older men, so she called the police and searches of her devices uncovered that she had been looking at images of self-harm.They locked down the wifi at home and the school helped too. But when she was outside of those places – on the bus, in cafes – she had no control.“I would never say social media or these images caused the death of my child,” she said. “Mental health is so much more complicated than that. A lot of the time she hid her mental health behind a really bubbly persona with a beautiful smile. It was the darker thoughts behind that that made her really vulnerable. These images are just very negative and they perpetuate already difficult mental health. They really shouldn’t be looked at. Children at the age of 12 are not emotionally developed.”Facebook has been contacted for comment.• If you’re a young person in the UK who needs to talk to someone about mental health, Childline can be reached on 0800 1111, or by confidential email via its website at childline.org.uk.

The Saracens’ prop, who missed the autumn campaign because of injury, suffered ankle ligament damage against France on Sunday and will be out of action for an expected 10 weeks.Vunipola has been instrumental in England’s fast start to the tournament. He was the man of the match in Dublin at the start of the month when he made 23 tackles. Ben Moon was on the bench against France having displaced Ellis Genge, leaving the England head coach, Eddie Jones, with a decision to make for the match against Wales in Cardiff next week.“It is very disappointing to lose Mako at this stage,” said Jones, whose side are potentially a victory in Wales away from reclaiming the title from Ireland having secured a try bonus point in each of their two victories, with Italy and Scotland at home to follow. “He is an important player for us but it does provide an opportunity for the team to grow.”Saracens said in a statement: “Following medical assessments Mako Vunipola has been ruled out of England’s Guinness Six Nations campaign with an ankle ligament injury. Vunipola picked up the injury during England’s win against France on Sunday and is expected to be out for 10 weeks. The prop will begin his rehabilitation with Saracens.”Vunipola was out for eight weeks after suffering a calf strain during Saracens’ European Champions Cup match at Glasgow in October. They face the same opponents in the quarter-finals at the end of next month when he will not be involved.Wales, meanwhile, will be without their No 8 Taulupe Faletau for the whole tournament. He suffered a broken arm playing for Bath last week in his return from the same injury and needs further surgery. Wales had hoped he would be available for at least their final match against Ireland, but no date has been put on his comeback.“We’re gutted for Taulupe but this is the best course of action for him,” said the Bath director of rugby, Todd Blackadder. “We will know more in terms of a time frame following the surgery, but we’re looking forward to welcoming him back into the squad.”Better news for Wales was the return of Leigh Halfpenny to full training three months after he was concussed during the victory over Australia. He will be available for selection against England, but after so long out he is more likely to be a contender for the bench than a starting position.The Scarlets have a PRO14 match in Treviso on Saturday, for which Halfpenny may be released. “We will get a message about who, if anyone, is getting released after Wales train on Wednesday,” said Pivac.The Gloucester scrum-half Callum Braley has been called up by Italy ahead of next week’s match against Ireland. The 24-year old qualifies through a grandfather."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f1baf15a5aa50181bbdf3825b78f6ff2a82f97a/249_42_4604_2762/master/4604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2511b9a9a3802b63a274c2d912f7506c","title":"grand national weights bristol de mai aintree","story":"Stamina is everything in the famous contest since the fences were softened and Ballyoptic’s credentials can’t be doubted“I’m so lucky! I’ve got a wealth of talent,” said Nigel Twiston-Davies when asked about his nine entries for this year’s Grand National at the unveiling of the weights on Tuesday. The Gloucestershire trainer had his tongue at least partly in his cheek but his Ballyoptic is very nicely positioned on 10st 11lbs and looks the best long-range pick of the 110 possible runners at odds of 33-1.Stamina is everything in the famous Aintree contest since the fences were softened and Ballyoptic’s credentials can’t be doubted in light of his powerful finish in last year’s Scottish Grand National. Alas for all concerned, he came up short by about an inch, carrying a stone more than the winner, Joe Farrell. The National’s extra emphasis on stamina can help him go one place better on 6 April.The obvious risk is his jumping and no one could be blamed for fretting over his fall when first tried over these fences in December’s Becher Chase. But that was only the seventh steeplechase of his career and he can learn from it. He was moving nicely into contention at the time. Interestingly, Twiston-Davies is in a position to ensure that Ballyoptic stays on that tempting mark of 10-11, since he also fields the top-weight, Bristol De Mai, and sounds keen to run the grey if he is ready to go again after the Cheltenham Gold Cup next month.The handicapper has offered him every incentive to run, having given Bristol De Mai a 5lb lower rating than he should have, under the now-familiar policy of compressing the top of the National weights. “That’s concentrated our minds on going for it,” Twiston-Davies said. Martin Greenwood got off to a flier in his first year setting the National weights, with no especially forceful complaints from connections. Eddie O’Leary, racing manager for Ireland’s powerful Gigginstown operation, was sometimes unhappy with the work of Greenwood’s predecessor, Phil Smith, but sounded entirely content with the weights given to his horses this time, including last year’s winner, Tiger Roll, who will shoulder just 11st 1lb if Bristol De Mai takes part. 11-10 Bristol De Mai11-6 Anibale Fly11-4 Elegant Escape, Alpha Des Obeaux11-3 The Storyteller11-2 Valtor11-1 Edwulf, Tiger Roll11-0 Outlander10-13 Don Poli, Go Conquer, Sub Lieutenant10-12 Blaklion, Mala Beach, Yala Enki10-11 Ballyoptic, Black Corton, Lake View Lad, Minella Rocco, Pleasant Company10-10 American, Dounikos, One For Arthur, Rathvinden, Shattered Love, Sizing Codelco, Total Recall, Traffic Fluide10-9 Rock The Kasbah, Warrior\u0027s Tale10-8 Auvergnat, Regal Encore, Royal Vacation10-7 A Toi Phil, Jury Duty, Magic Of Light, Master Dee10-6 Monbeg Notorious, Noble Endeavour, Sandymount Duke, The Last Samuri10-5 Acapella Bourgeois, Ramses De Teillee, Tea For Two10-4 Daklondike, Mall Dini10-3 Callett Mad, Step Back, The Dutchman, Ultragold10-2 Blow By Blow, Ms Parfois, Pairofbrowneyes, Singlefarmpayment, Some Neck, Up For Review, Valseur Lido, Vieux Lion Rouge10-1 Abolitionist, Give Me A Copper, Missed Approach10-0 Folsom Blue, General Principle, Livelovelaugh, Vintage Clouds, Walk In The Mill, Willie Boy9-13 Ballyhill, Bless The Wings, Captain Redbeard, Polidam9-12 Allysson Monterg, Baie Des Iles, Exitas, Isleofhopendreams, Joe Farrell, Just A Par, Red Infantry, Shantou Village, The Young Master9-11 Westerner Point9-10 Ballyarthur, Ballydine, Cogry, Fact Of The Matter, Out Sam, Vieux Morvan9-9 Impulsive Star, Kingswell Theatre, Mr Diablo9-8 Carole\u0027s Destrier, Milansbar9-7 Borice, Jarob, Measureofmydreams, Rogue Angel, Splash Of Ginge, Ziga Boy9-5 Call It Magic, Highland Lodge, Kilcrea Vale, Woods Well9-3 Looking Well9-2 Back To The Thatch, Potters Corner8-13 Morney Wing8-12 Ned Stark, Rathlin Rose8-11 Scoir Mear, Van Gogh Du Granit • Skipthecuddles and Lieutenant Colonel not qualifiedThe only contretemps came when Sir Anthony McCoy made clear his feelings that Auvergnat had been harshly treated on 10st 8lbs, representing a hike of a stone and a half for his Leopardstown win at Christmas. Greenwood noted the horse had some classy cross-country form. “But this isn’t a cross-country race,” McCoy countered.Held in Liverpool for the first time, this weights launch was a success after a couple of difficult years when late-night London venues proved unsuitable, through poor acoustics or failing power.

Basil Kronfli, who has been vegan for two years, gives us the lowdown on the pros, cons and quirks of an animal-free diet …Do you actually like the taste of vegan food?Absolutely. I love foods such as peanut butter, dark chocolate, hummus, falafel, roast potatoes, berries and mangos – which are all vegan. It’s actually much easier to eat vegan than I thought it would be when I made the switch two years ago.Are there any grey areas with some vegan foods?Honey is as tricky as it is sticky, and really ides the vegan community. On the one hand, it’s an animal product and vegans don’t eat animal products. On the other, beekeepers are actually helping bee populations – which have been dwindling in recent years – so supporting them by eating honey could be seen as a good deed for the bees. What makes things even more complicated is the fact that when beekeepers harvest the honey, they replace it with a sugar syrup that lacks the essential micronutrients of honey and isn’t as healthy for bees. Basically, it’s complicated.Do you feel like you miss out on sweet treats such as chocolate and ice-cream?It’s such a misconception that being vegan means you can’t have indulgent foods. Bourbon biscuits, golden syrup, boiled sweets, sorbets and dark chocolate are all vegan (to name but a few), and more and more sweet vegan treats are entering the market.For instance, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s now has vegan versions of three of its most popular ice-creams: Chocolate Fudge Brownie, Chunky Monkey and Peanut Butter \u0026amp Cookies. It’s also just released a new vegan flavour: Coconutterly Caramel’d.What’s the most challenging thing about being vegan?I love baking, and not being able to use eggs can be pretty tricky. Baking vegan treats is getting easier, but when you’ve baked with eggs your whole life, getting used to replacements can be challenging, especially as there’s no one-size-fits-all solution.Where do you get your protein?Plenty of wholefoods pack a healthy dose of protein. Soy, pulses and nuts are just a few examples you can easily get in your daily diet. Going for Japanese food? Get a bowl of edamame and you’ll hit your daily requirement in no time. Increasingly, vegan protein supplements are really easy to access, too – brown rice protein is one of the most popular vegan proteins and is a great alternative for those avoiding soy.Are there any health downsides?There are a couple of vitamins and minerals you will probably want to supplement if you make the switch. The most talked about is vitamin B12. The reason this is lacking from most vegan diets comes down to the quality of soil in vegetables we eat today compared with pre-commercial farming soil. Other optional supplements can come from food. Mushrooms, for example, pack plenty of vitamin D. Flax seeds have the essential fatty acids vegans won’t be getting from fish, broccoli has biotin, while tomatoes have lycopene.What’s eating out as a vegan like?There’s plenty of choice in the UK. Loads of popular chain restaurants now have vegan menus or, at the very least, a couple of vegan options. When you go farther afield, especially on the continent, the meat and cheese can get a bit relentless, but there’s an excellent app that can help with that. It’s called HappyCow and it matches you with suitable eateries nearby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e5a1c12521a64d3cea857c1fac9bf31f03c908/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11d5f2a567295cadb85321cfe3f9b4cb 700w","title":"from ice cream to nice cream the inside scoop on the ice cream revolutionaries","story":" In 1978, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield set out to make ice-cream with a difference. Here’s how Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is still pushing boundaries and fighting for change 40 years laterWhen Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield first set up shop in an old petrol station in Burlington, Vermont, in 1978, selling scoops of homemade ice-cream, they wanted to build a company that cared as much about people as profits.Since then, their tiny ice-cream business has become a global brand whose famous flavours, including Cookie Dough and Cherry Garcia, are sold in 35 countries. Yet, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s ethos remains the same: to “make great ice-cream in the nicest possible way”.It’s a belief that is central to everything the brand does, from its social activism to constant experimentation with new flavours. The ethos inspired Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s line of non-dairy ice-creams that was launched in the UK in 2017 to a rapturous reception from vegans. The flavours – Chunky Monkey, Chocolate Fudge Brownie and Peanut Butter \u0026amp Cookies and the new flavour Coconutterly Caramel’d – are just as inventively delicious as the brand’s dairy creations.For Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s employees, honouring the goals of its co-founders – who remain advisers to the company since being bought by Unilever in the year 2000 – is vital. “Right from the start, Cohen and Greenfield wanted the business to be a force for good,” says Rebecca Baron, the brand’s social mission manager. “Four decades on, we’re still guided by their values.”Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s three-pronged approach – making excellent ice-cream achieving financial success and using the brand to make the world a better place – stems back to ideas developed by Cohen and Greenfield in the company’s early days.The company works with social enterprises, such as Greyston Bakery in New York, which supplies the brownies that make the Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavour so enticing. “They employ people with criminal records, homeless people, recovering addicts and vulnerable women – people who are finding it hard to get a job,” says Baron. “They offer subsidised housing and healthcare to their workers.”Once Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s popularity began to grow, it quickly realised that it could use its platform to campaign on social issues. It was a discovery born of a David and Goliath tussle with its rival, Häagen-Dazs.“Greenfield had the idea to pack the ice-cream into pint-sized containers and sell it in convenience stores, but Pillsbury, who owned Häagen-Dazs, didn’t like this at all,” says Baron. “They threatened all their stores with exclusivity clauses, saying they could stock one, but not both. Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s didn’t have the resources to fight it in the courts, so Greenfield created a one-man picket outside the Pillsbury headquarters. Pictures of him were everywhere. They managed to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people to put pressure on Pillsbury to back down, which they eventually did.”The same principle is applied to its latest campaigns on issues including climate change, marriage equality, racism and refugees. The brand is currently running a company-wide campaign, lobbying the UK government to allow asylum seekers the right to work. “At the moment, they’re banned, which means people can be living in poverty for years,” says Baron. “We’re using every tool we have as a business to mobilise our fans to help us create systemic change.”One area the brand is pouring a lot of effort into is reducing its carbon footprint. Its caring dairy programme has more than 300 participating farms in the US and Europe. “The idea is that the farms that Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s offers support to have to meet high environmental standards,” says Baron. “The company is always working to move into increasingly sustainable farming practices and improve its emissions.”The launch of its almond milk-based non-dairy range – with more flavours set to arrive in Britain in 2019 – is a way to offer a lower-emission alternative to the increasing numbers of people who aren’t necessarily vegan, but want to make more ethical food choices. “So many people want to reduce their personal carbon footprint, so it’s great to give people that flexibility,” she says.And for those who are vegan, or lactose intolerant, the range aims to prove that it needn’t mean missing out. One of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s key principles is inclusion, which its non-dairy range fits into perfectly. “We wanted to offer people who can’t – or have chosen not to – eat dairy ice-cream, an alternative that is just as good as the dairy version,” she says. “We wanted to make sure they get some love, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bc71bface7ef6903bde9854f48c8988b922630/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f948dcdbaf8026e4e43892e7df17b71a","title":"theres never been a better time to be vegan","story":"With restaurants, chefs and well-known brands introducing more vegan options than ever, sticking to a plant-based diet is now both simple and indulgent, says Club Mexicana’s Meriel Armitage A decade ago, when I decided to go vegan for ethical reasons, the word “decadent” was one you’d never have used to describe the food available. More often than not, it fitted the joyless stereotype of lentils, quinoa and tofu, with the occasional Linda McCartney vegan sausage to liven things up. Now, though, ask a vegan what they ate last night and they’re likely to say anything from pizza topped with gooey melted “cheese” to crispy fried “chicken” or pulled jackfruit burritos. The vegan scene has truly exploded, introducing food that’s exciting, colourful and indulgent, whether you’re vegan or not.When I launched my pop-up, Club Mexicana, in 2012 I wanted to challenge the boringly virtuous chickpea and chia seed perception of veganism. Inspired by my travels in the US, where vegan food is innovative and delicious, I wanted to prove that being vegan doesn’t mean missing out.I realised the joy of Mexican food doesn’t stem from the meat, but the bold, punchy flavours created by salsas and pickles – the meat is just a carrier for those flavours. We try to be as creative as possible with our dishes, which include tacos with baja “tofish” – tofu fish – and roasted cornbread with pecan mole, smoked soya yoghurt, pickled pear and smoked tomato. When we first started holding supper clubs, a lot of people didn’t even notice the food was vegan, which is what I wanted.Over the past few years, vegan ingredients have evolved rapidly, which has helped vegan cooking to become as exciting as it is. Vegan cheese used to be terrible, but now you can buy everything from vegan blue cheese and camembert to cheddar and ricotta – all tasting as piquant and decadently creamy as the real thing. At Club Mexicana, we serve deep-fried “mozzarella” sticks made with coconut oil, which are crispy on the outside and oozingly melty in the middle.People also often wrongly assume that going vegan will mean depriving themselves of indulgent desserts and treats, but that’s no longer the case either. The naughtiest dish we offer is deep-fried ice-cream doused in chocolate sauce – it really doesn’t get more indulgent than that.More and more restaurants are offering innovative vegan menus. Supermarkets now stock an amazing range of vegan food that’s expanding all the time. Brands, such as Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, are constantly bringing out new vegan products that are causing a buzz outside, as well as inside, the vegan world.There’s never been a better time to be vegan, or just to introduce more plant-based alternatives into your everyday diet. With so many amazing colours, textures and flavours on offer, you never need to feel you’re depriving yourself of the food you love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e6527a7265ec1f24b1b091bcbb3b4c1f3825f70/0_1_1082_649/master/1082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc359a3399d69153254015c428972dd6","title":"jeff bezos gavin de becker national enquirer amazon","story":"Gavin de Becker has spent decades protecting the rich and famous. Now he’s helping the Amazon CEO take on a tabloidThe National Enquirer has his sexts and, it appears, saucy photos. His imminent orce is the talk of Wall Street.So Jeff Bezos, the Amazon boss, announced on Friday that he had turned to a singular figure for help – a “bodyguard to the stars” and Los Angeles-based security consultant named Gavin de Becker.Bezos and his longtime wife, MacKenzie, are orcing and the National Enquirer has revealed his extramarital affair with the television personality Lauren Sánchez. Writing on the website Medium, Bezos said the publisher of the National Enquirer had threatened to publish sexual photos he and Sanchez shared if he did not call off De Becker, whom Bezos described as an acquaintance of 20 years. De Becker, Bezos said, is still on the job with instructions “to proceed with whatever budget he needed to pursue the facts” related to the Enquirer’s possession of his communications.By declaring his troubles so publicly, Bezos was operating straight out of De Becker’s playbook.In his 1997 book The Gift of Fear, De Becker offered a strategy for dealing with extortionists. De Becker described the case of a client, a young actress, whose ex-boyfriend was demanding $50,000 for his silence about a private matter. He suggested she “kill the threat” by disclosing the matter to her parents so they wouldn’t learn it in “a tabloid’s way”.“Disclosing harmful information oneself is so radical an idea that most victims of extortion never even consider it,” De Becker wrote, noting that his firm has “a few cases” like that each year.De Becker \u0026amp Associates, the 64-year-old’s firm, provides security and, as in Bezos’s case, conducts private investigations for the rich, the powerful and the famous. He has been romantically linked to stars – he dated Geena Davis and Alanis Morissette – and was a guest on Oprah. He and his employees are frequent foes to the tabloid press.In The Gift of Fear, De Becker recounts, in jarring detail, a childhood defined by brutality. He describes picking up a pistol his mother used to shoot his stepfather, gripping it by the hot barrel as his mother went to tend the wounded man she’d just shot. As he tells it, those experiences drove him to understand violence and fear.De Becker’s destiny was set at least in part by geography. Attending Beverly Hills high school, he befriended the actor Carrie Fisher, at whose funeral he spoke, and Miguel Ferrer, son of Rosemary Clooney. De Becker went to work for Elizabeth Taylor at 19 as an assistant, took over security for Shaun Cassidy, then a teen star, at 23, and launched his security firm in 1978.By ever-increasing degrees, has been a Hollywood fixture since, and has become known for injecting analytical processes into the security business.Dr Park Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist called as an expert to testify against Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Kaczynski and other prominent killers, began working with De Becker in 1983. De Becker’s firm had collected thousands of threatening communications sent to stars, and built dossiers on their authors to gauge those threats. Those records, and a similar collection held by the US Capitol police, formed the basis for their joint research: a National Institute of Justice-supported study of threats against public figures.They shared an interest, Dietz said, in changing the way society understood stalking, which was then viewed as something experienced only by a handful of famous women. Dietz, founder of the Threat Assessment Group, believes their work made stalking “a household word” and a prosecutable crime.De Becker, Dietz said, was “on the vanguard of recognizing the similarity of paparazzi and other stalkers”. De Becker also wanted to revolutionize his industry.“His concern was that Hollywood was full of thug-like bodyguards, with various backgrounds in the martial arts or the military or professional wrestling,” Dietz told the . “He wanted to try to professionalize an industry that was not well-regarded. And he was a leader in that.”De Becker’s approach hinges on the proposition that violence can be anticipated, and that would-be subjects of violent crime can be prepared. He has developed, and aggressively defended from critics, a suite of threat assessment tools known as Mosaic. Users answer a series of questions about a threatening person or occurrence using an online interface the system analyses the answers and gauges the level of threat. His efforts landed De Becker a seat across from Oprah in 2008, an appearance that solidified his status as a security guru.De Becker is an unabashed protector of the famous and powerful. He launched a private terminal at LAX, the Los Angeles airport, catering to that cohort. He took out an advertisement in the Hollywood Reporter defending Mel Gibson after the actor’s drunken antisemitic tirade was caught on police video. His other clients have been reported to include Madonna, Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael J Fox and John Travolta. He provided security to Planned Parenthood, was hired by the Cosbys to investigate threats against the family after the only son of Bill and Camille Cosby was killed, and has consulted on blockbuster films, including The Bodyguard.During the years Dietz worked with De Becker, he visited the homes of De Becker’s clients, touring guardhouses and safe rooms De Becker’s team had installed. De Becker, Dietz said, moved with the glad-handing charm of a successful sports agent. “He knew every aspect of the world of celebrity, and had a real commitment to trying to protect them against people who would do them harm,” Dietz said.Dietz described his time in De Becker’s celebrity-stuffed world eye-opening “and, frankly, fun”.Others have made a similar appraisal, though considering his travails, Bezos may not be enjoying his time in De Becker’s orbit quite so much.“He’s the funniest civilian I know,” the comedian Harry Shearer told the Los Angeles Times in 2002 of De Becker. “He’s very bright and disciplined, and he’d probably be good at whatever he wanted to do. But if you do what he does for a living, having a light side would be a necessity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d91b242773da8bb8b59b6172add16b02a950b71/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e39d98650f31bb823423fe3601fccc87","title":"send us a tip on small music venues the world over for the chance of winning a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Whether it’s a shack, ornate theatre or backstreet club, we want to know about your favourite small music venue – anywhere apart from the UKHearing great live music in an authentic and memorable setting can be a highlight of any trip.Venues including shebeens, clubs, theatres, basements, e bars and even churches can all prove brilliant settings for gigs.We want to hear about great venues anywhere in the world, but not festivals or the UK this time (we covered that in December) – and definitely not arenas or stadium gigs.

After being damaged during Storm Desmond in December 2015, its interior has been rebuilt and is now a bright open-plan space that tells the story of Keswick’s pencil industry from its origins in the 1550s. That’s when Borrowdale shepherds are said to have discovered that the black substance clinging to the base of an upturned tree was really useful for marking their sheep. The mineral was graphite, known locally as “wad”. In the 17th century some saw it as more valuable than gold, which led to a thriving black market, centred on a Keswick pub.During the second world war Keswick pencil-makers were commissioned by MI6’s Charles Fraser-Smith – the real-life Q – to design and make a secret pencil to help British airmen evade capture. The ordinary-looking pencils concealed miniature brass compasses and tightly rolled tissue-paper maps showing escape routes out of Germany.As centrepieces go, it’s not quite as “wow” as the Natural History Museum’s Blue Whale skeleton, but the 7.91-metre colouring pencil made at the Derwent Pencil Factory (which relocated from Keswick to nearby Workington in 2008) dominates the museum hall like a psychedelic missile.The new Artisan Café sells good locally roasted coffee and makes its own cakes and soup (soup with bread £5.30). However, in charging £5.65 for a cheese sandwich, £5.95 for a tuna mayo jacket potato and £4.75 for its children’s meals (including chicken nuggets and fries sausage and chips), it faces tough competition in a town where there are several great cafes within a five-minute walk.It’s more of an art shop than a gift shop, selling artists’ graphite, charcoal, pastel and watercolour pencils made by Derwent. Colouring books for all ages range from Peter Rabbit to Game of Thrones.Keswick is about 16 miles (20 minutes) drive from junction 40 of the M6, and via the A66. Buses run hourly from Penrith rail station (X4 and X5) and take about 50 minutes to Keswick town centre.710.It’s rather static and probably not hands-on enough to entertain younger children – some of the working machines from the original museum were lost in the flood – yet the enthusiastic, knowledgeable staff bring it alive and make it a happy place to escape the weather for an hour or two."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d2296632f25b4f3b1a64d8b6e8806819b9a4b6/0_231_7782_4669/master/7782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c4d3c011a8a0abf1ec607864a5559f3","title":"twa hotel new york jfk airport open for bookings","story":"TWA’s classic Flight Center has been turned into a new hotel inspired by 1960s decor and Jet Age nostalgia“Nobody likes to hang around airports” ran TWA’s 1960s slogan – but the new TWA Hotel at New York’s JFK airport aims to encourage travellers to do just that. The former airline’s stylish terminal building, designed by Eero Saarinen and opened in 1962, is being redeveloped into a 512-bedroom property. The midcentury modern-inspired hotel will open on 15 May, with bookings starting on 14 February (at noon EST, 5pm GMT).The original 1962 building, known as the TWA Flight Center, will be the hotel’s main hub, featuring six restaurants, eight bars, shops and a rooftop pool, while two new “wings” will house the guestrooms. The 1960s-style interiors will include midcentury modern Saarinen furniture, retro TWA posters, rewired vintage rotary phones and views of the runways through noise-cancelling floor-to-ceiling windows.The original neofuturist structure includes a winged, thin shell roof and fluid, open design, which the architect hoped would evoke the sensation of flight. It became a designated New York City Landmark in 1994 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The redevelopment includes renovation of the arched, red-carpeted flight tubes – as seen in Steven Spielberg’s 2002 film Catch Me If You Can – which connect it to terminal five. The hotel will also feature a classic Italian Solari split-flap mechanical message board, a large observation deck and a museum dedicated to the Jet Age, with vintage uniforms, original in-flight amenities and other memorabilia.A 1958 Lockheed Constellation airplane has also been transformed into a cocktail lounge just outside the hotel. Originally commissioned in 1939 by TWA owner Howard Hughes, the “Connie” model broke the transcontinental speed record in 1946. This particular plane, Connie N8083H, is one of only four remaining of its kind, and has been restored with original parts, including cockpit controls. It had a colourful former life, shuttling supplies to Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in the 60s before being modified to airdrop marijuana from in South America, and abandoned in Honduras in the 80s.Managed by MCR and Morse Development, the hotel has been under construction since late 2016 and is expected to be popular with “avgeeks”, preservationists and Mad Men fans as well as JFK stopover travellers. Rooms will cost from $249 a night"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7f6eefb9f8488911172fb8c6de3172c9e0283e3/959_611_2565_1539/master/2565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eec3590dc9deef6d56cfee2671f6cde","title":"endeavour its inspector morse with a moustache and surprisingly great","story":"This 60s-set prequel to the legendary ITV detective series might look like a cosy Heartbeat-style drama, but something far darker and stranger is at playThis article contains minor spoilers for series 1-6 of EndeavourIt sounds borderline bizarre to insist that the sixth series of a TV drama is a good jumping-on point. But if you’ve so far resisted ITV’s Sunday-night staple Endeavour – AKA The 1960s Adventures of Young Morse, Before He Got So Crotchety (Although He is Actually Already Pretty Crotchety) – the latest series seems consciously designed to get any latecomers up to speed. It helps, of course, that this is a prequel to one of the most prestigious and popular ITV dramas of all time. Even if you don’t know where the character has been for the past five seasons, you probably have a decent idea about where he is going to end up.That love for John Thaw’s original Inspector Morse remains strong almost two decades after the final episode aired, to the extent that Endeavour has from the outset seemed a little skippable. Beyond the potential commercial benefits, was there really any urgent need to investigate the trials and traumas that forged such a beloved character, even with the added aesthetic pleasures of a 1960s Oxford setting, all duck-egg blue cars and Green Shield stamps?Probably not, but from that unpromising start Endeavour has evolved into its own distinct and sure-footed entity, something often much darker and stranger than its swinging 1960s marketing might suggest. You might imagine it as the bookish cousin of Heartbeat, ITV’s pastoral motorcycle-cop timewarp. Yet, with its elaborate whodunnits featuring theatrically self-involved characters brought to heel by Morse’s persistence and cool logic, Endeavour is often more reminiscent of Jonathan Creek. Compared to other long-running primetime dramas, it also features an unusually consistent tone and grasp of its key characters, perhaps because creator Russell Lewis – who cut his teeth on the original Morse plus the spinoff Lewis – has so far written every single episode, a remarkable achievement.Season six is set in 1969 and kicked off last Sunday with a budget-burning blast of Led Zeppelin’s What Is and What Should Never Be, a suitably operatic overture in its own frazzled way. This felt like a soft reboot, not least because Morse (played by the gaunt and watchful Shaun Evans) has nurtured a man-of-the-people moustache after being demoted to uniform sergeant. After the dissolution of his old Cowley CID – superseded by the formation of the new Thames Valley police – Morse is now pootling around a pastoral Oxford patch where his most urgent case is locating a wayward horse. His former squadmates, including gruff but warm-hearted mentor Fred Thursday (Roger Allam), are also adjusting to new circumstances in different units, although all are still haunted by the unsolved murder of one of their colleagues, a gloomy hangover from series five.By the end of the opening episode, Morse has untangled a murder and child abduction and is promoted back to plain-clothes duty, though he opts to retain the ‘tache. In the process, he has already managed to rub his new DCI Ronnie Box up the wrong way. A cocky transplant from London with hands-on experience dealing with armed blaggers, DCI Box seems like the antithesis to Morse and his analytical methods. But there is the meta thrill of seeing Simon Harrison as Box, essentially channelling Thaw’s boisterous Regan from The Sweeney, butting heads with Evans, embodying a younger version of Thaw’s Morse.So you could easily join the Endeavour party in season six. Sure, you will have missed out on some pivotal moments, such as Morse briefly being jailed (wrongly), going undercover as a teacher with a pretend wife and unexpectedly triumphing in an It’s A Knockout sprinting heat while wearing an oversized costume, but you’ll easily get the gist. While it might be a stretch to claim that Endeavour is like a real-ale Better Call Saul, that rare prequel that not only manages to match the original but overtake it, it is consistently well-crafted and satisfying in its own right.By the end of its current run, Endeavour will have reached 27 episodes, just six shy of the original Inspector Morse’s total of 33. As a mark of respect, the popular Lewis spin-off halted at 33, so perhaps there isn’t even that much more of Endeavour runway to go. Evans has already let slip that at the end of this season we’ll see Morse move into the flat where he will spend the rest of his life. From there, surely season seven will involve a fateful meeting with the true love of his life: a vintage 2.4 litre burgundy Mark II Jaguar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58b8693ad68dbeeec6bda011d72e21f2f643f5c8/0_135_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04f8e277082fe9daf81e4deb1184ddfd","title":"alexandria ocasio cortez twitter social media","story":"In eight months, the new congresswoman has built one of DC’s most engaged followings. Here are her best movesWhen it comes to Twitter, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress last November, beats every other US politician hands, nose and elbows down. She has built one of the most engaged followings on Capitol Hill in just eight months and was even appointed to teach social media lessons to her colleagues upon her arrival.How does she do it? I spend my days analyzing data for the  and helping run our social media accounts, so I’m used to digging into numbers and figuring out what gets people going. And more often than not, it’s the less obvious things that reveal what’s really happening.Ocasio-Cortez also has more than 2.1 million followers on Instagram and 500,000 on Facebook, but Twitter is where she really dominates the conversation.She already has more Twitter followers than the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi (2.2 million), and she only just trails Joe Biden (3.3 million). Even when you look at pure, non-weighted engagement, Ocasio-Cortez still punches well above her weight. For example, Trump has 21 times more followers than her. Yet he generated only 2.5 times as many total interactions as she did in January (43.2m compared to 17.5m).All these numbers are useful for understanding the scale of Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter popularity, but do little in terms of explaining it. To further understand why they’ve done so well, here’s a brief timeline of her rapid ascent, and the tweets that have defined it:Ocasio-Cortez introduced herself to many voters with a campaign video in May that ended up going semi-viral. But it was her primary win in June that first gave her a national platform, and this tweet (her biggest in June) set the tone for how she was going to operate.It quickly established that Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t going to let her critics – whether Republicans or Democrats – shape her narrative. Her tweet is a two-part fact-check. But instead of using cold stats like fact-checks usually do, she provides photographic and anecdotal evidence that’s much more personal and emotive.Whether they like it or not, the very fair and balanced people over at Fox News have played a considerable role in Ocasio-Cortez’s success. On top of the all the free airtime they’ve given her, they’ve also provided her with plenty of ammo.The above graphic in particular sparked a running joke that Ocasio-Cortez would use again: is the Fox News graphics department actually on her side?During a recent talk, the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates asked Ocasio-Cortez when she decides to “dunk on fools”. “Whoever is coming at me in my mentions with a blue check when I haven’t eaten in three hours,” she said. “And until more people start pitching in and holding people to account, I’m just going to let them have it.”This was Ocasio-Cortez’s most popular tweet in September and, just like her biggest one in June, she’s setting the record straight.Targeting the far right is always going to be a popular move on Twitter. But it’s her use of “slaying lewks” that douses her already fire tweet with the most flammable thing on the internet: relatability. She speaks the language of her young fans, and they’ve probably never seen anything like it from a politician before.This is what really sets her apart in Congress. Most politicians are elected to represent normal people yet have to hire consultants for advice on how to speak to millennials. Remember when Hillary Clinton told people to “Pokémon Go to the polls”?It should also be noted that September was the month Ocasio-Cortez took her Fox-trolling to new heights:It’s no surprise that, in an age where authenticity matters more than ever, Ocasio-Cortez has done so well. Her story of growing up in a working-class family and bartending a year before she won her primary has become a powerful part of her appeal.It’s not the sole reason she’s popular, but rather acts as a shield around her beliefs. Republicans have tried to dismantle this story as much as possible, and you can see why. After they’ve spent decades trying to paint liberals as out-of-touch elites, it’s one of the biggest threats to their entire narrative.It may not sound like much to anyone who regularly uses emojis, but this is big for a member of Congress. Remember when Hillary asked people to sum up how people felt about student debt in three emojis? And can you imagine someone like Beto O’Rourke or Elizabeth Warren even using the cry-laughing one without it looking weird? (Case in point: Warren attempted to speak internet last month, by asking the account WeRateDogs if her golden retriever was a “1510 official Good Boy”.)There’s no magic to Ocasio-Cortez’s use of our modern-day hieroglyphs, but what’s notable is how you rarely notice them – they never jar or stand out. Like the rest of her language they have a natural flow, and help crystallize her air of authenticity.This tweet was Ocasio-Cortez’s biggest in December. In it, she contrasts her working-class background with her new job in Congress, and taps into people’s huge frustrations with the healthcare system.Intentionally or not, it proves she’s still one of us, and isn’t going to give Congress a free pass now she’s part of it. There’s not much to dislike if you’re a young, leftwing American who values authenticity and a willingness to hold power to account.January was @AOC’s biggest month so far, with the account adding a million new followers. A great deal of this momentum was generated by this one tweet, which got over 160k retweets and 787,000 likes.The video shows her dancing to Edwin Starr’s song War (the one that goes “what is it good for?”). It was a tongue-in-cheek response after she was “outed” for dancing in a spoof music video in college.The original footage was posted by a strange, seemingly rightwing account looking to undermine her. “Here is America’s favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is,” read the post. The account was later deleted, raising the hilarious possibility that it was planted by someone on the left who knew it would do wonders for her.Either way, it became the new focal point for the left’s battle with the right over Ocasio-Cortez, and a huge news story.The idea that all Republicans were mocking her for dancing quickly took hold, despite limited examples of them doing so. But the smear did chime with many of the right’s pearl-clutching attacks on her, and the leftwing backlash became part of a wider cry of frustration over her treatment by Republicans.Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet was the climax of the whole ordeal and even by her standards was a surprise. Politicians have danced before Obama was particularly adept at it. But has anyone ever done it in a way that is both entertaining and makes a deft political point?The tweet is really a perfect example of why Ocasio-Cortez has done so well on Twitter. She doesn’t just respond to news or release statements like most politicians – she creates her own content and makes her own news, in an unpredictable and authentic way.And just when you think you’ve seen all the possible fact-checks, clapbacks, and details from her past, she comes out dancing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b96b195b6124c92457c545b4ed43191b93c8907/0_17_2879_1728/master/2879.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c4ff5c34f43fd4845e8c428e7e64b8d","title":"european powers take backseat in us polish summit on middle east","story":"Lack of participation at Middle East event reflects anger over US policy on Iran and SyriaKey European powers will offer only limited participation in a high-profile Trump administration summit on the Middle East starting on Wednesday, reflecting their growing anger over unilateral US policymaking on Iran and Syria.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, will leave the Warsaw summit early, pleading Brexit Commons business, while France is sending a civil servant and Germany its junior foreign minister.Federica Mogherini, the EU external affairs chief, will boycott the event, originally conceived by the US as a way to press EU countries to adopt a more aggressive stance towards Iran.The original summit agenda was scrapped after Europe told Washington it was “not a very smart idea” to hold a summit that would highlight Europe’s differences with the US over Iran. The EU was not consulted before Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, announced the summit, jointly hosted with Poland.Despite retitling the agenda to focus on peace and security in the Middle East, European diplomats remain sceptical that figures such as Pompeo and the US vice-president, Mike Pence, will dial down their anti-Iran rhetoric at the summit.The EU remains strongly supportive of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that was abandoned by the US, even if it criticises Iran’s ballistic missile programme. It has finally devised a preliminary trading vehicle to resist US secondary sanctions on firms that continue to trade with Iran.The presence of leading anti-Iran Gulf states as well as Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu in Warsaw will underline how hostility towards Iran can bring some Arab states and Israel together. One western diplomat said it would be the first meeting between Arab states and Israel since 1991 Madrid peace conference.Non-attendees include Qatar, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran and the Palestinian Authority.The US has signalled it will extend sanctions on Iranian oil exports in May. Brian Hook, the US special representative on Iran, said last week: “We are not looking to grant any future waivers or exceptions to our sanctions regime, whether it’s oil or anything else,” adding that the US aims to “get to zero imports” of Iranian crude as quickly as possible.The Trump’s administration exempted eight counties from its sanctions, allowing them to continue importing crude from Iran for six months up to May.British officials are privately sceptical about the rhetoric coming from Washington that it might impose sanctions on the proposed mechanism being set up by Europe to help trade, initially in unsanctioned goods such as food and medicines.The Foreign Office permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, would have to be one of those sanctioned by Washington since he is on the board of the new EU body.Meanwhile, differences between Europe and the US over Syria were exposed in the Commons on Monday when Hunt was unusually open in expressing his qualms about Trump’s call for the unilateral withdrawal of 2,000 US troops from Syria.Hunt said it was “encouraging that, although the original announcement suggested this withdrawal would happen very quickly, the US has behaved with considerable pragmatism in practice”.He signalled his determination that the US departure should not leave its Kurdish allies in northern Syria exposed to a potential Turkish attack. “Were we to let them down now, it would send a terrible signal about our commitment to our allies for any future conflict in which we might be engaged,” Hunt told MPs. The Kurdish-led SDF has detained a total of 900 foreign fighters who joined Isis during the Syrian civil war. Hunt said urgent consultations were under way in Whitehall about whether to take back British fighters and their families if the SDF decided it could no longer hold them. France is also reviewing its policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b5600e542b413fb72c170b1360d6b1bdb229b7b/0_0_4074_2444/master/4074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34972f55fa74e9a7c781696166ad0c40","title":"four in five vatican priests are gay book claims","story":"French journalist’s book is a ‘startling account of corruption and hypocrisy’, publisher saysSome of the most senior clerics in the Roman Catholic church who have vociferously attacked homosexuality are themselves gay, according to a book to be published next week.Eighty per cent of priests working at the Vatican are gay, although not necessarily sexually active, it is claimed in the book, In the Closet of the Vatican.The 570-page book, which the French journalist and author Frédéric Martel spent four years researching, is a “startling account of corruption and hypocrisy at the heart of the Vatican”, according to its British publisher Bloomsbury.It is being published in eight languages across 20 countries next Wednesday, coinciding with the opening day of a conference at the Vatican on sexual abuse, to which bishops from all over the world have been summoned.Martel, a former adviser to the French government, conducted 1,500 interviews while researching the book, including with 41 cardinals, 52 bishops and monsignors, 45 papal ambassadors or diplomatic officials, 11 Swiss guards and more than 200 priests and seminarians, according to a report on the Catholic website the Tablet.Many spoke of an unspoken code of the “closet”, with one rule of thumb being that the more homophobic a cleric was, the more likely he was to be gay.Martel alleges that one Colombian cardinal, the late Alfonso López Trujillo, who held a senior Vatican position, was an arch-defender of church teaching on homosexuality and contraception while using male prostitutes, the Tablet said.The author found that some gay priests accepted their sexuality and a few maintained discreet relationships, but others sought high-risk casual encounters. Some were in denial about their sexuality.Although the book does not conflate homosexuality with the sexual abuse of children, Martel describes a secretive culture among priests that creates conditions in which abuse is not confronted, say people familiar with the book’s contents.According to Bloomsbury’s promotional material, Inside the Closet “reveals secrets” about celibacy, misogyny and plots against Pope Francis. It uncovers “a clerical culture of secrecy which starts in junior seminaries and continues right up to the Vatican itself”.Francis has riled his conservative critics in the Vatican over his apparently softer tone towards gay people. A few months into his papacy, he told reporters who asked about a “gay lobby” at the Vatican: “If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?”Last year Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean survivor of sexual abuse, said Francis told him in a private meeting: “Juan Carlos, that you are gay does not matter. God made you like this and loves you like this and I don’t care. The pope loves you like this. You have to be happy with who you are.”But a Polish priest who was sacked from his Vatican job and defrocked after announcing he was gay has accused the church of making the lives of millions of gay Catholics “a hell”.In a letter to Francis in 2015, Krzysztof Charamsa criticised what he called the Vatican’s hypocrisy in banning gay priests and said the clergy was “full of homosexuals”.In December, Francis was quoted in a book about vocations as saying homosexuality was a “fashion” to which the clergy was susceptible.The timing of Inside the Closet’s publication, at the start of a milestone summit on sexual abuse, will raise concerns that some people may seek to conflate the two issues.But the book’s allegations are likely to be pored over by senior bishops flying into Rome from more than 100 countries for the four-day summit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c29271266708350c0a5c909149b2b2a0b3a5f0ec/0_159_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83703a4540901092f31a4751c9975dae","title":"home office criticised for accelerating removals to zimbabwe","story":"Lawyers say UK is working with Zimbabwe to deport asylum seekers despite human rights abusesThe Zimbabweans facing deportation from the UK The Home Office has been condemned for working with the Zimbabwean government to accelerate the deportation of asylum seekers despite high-profile human rights abuses in the country.Asylum lawyers and charities told the  that since Robert Mugabe was forced from power in November 2017, the Home Office has started to push ahead with a removals process for refused asylum seekers, many of whom have been in the UK for over a decade.Despite international condemnation of the actions of the police and army under the new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, two asylum seekers were detained at the Home Office’s Vulcan House building on Monday. It is thought that the government is preparing to deport them within days.One of them, Victor Mujakachi, came to the UK as a postgraduate student in 2003. Zimbabwean authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in 2008 after he made critical comments online about the re-election of Mugabe. He subsequently had three applications for asylum turned down.On 28 January at 4pm, the courts also had to grant an “urgent stay of removal” for a Zimbabwean refused asylum who was due to be deported at 5.25pm that evening. The reason given for the decision was the volatile conditions in the country.The applicant claimed to have a profile as an opposition activist and said their family members had been arrested. The judge noted that serious concerns had been expressed by governments around the world, including the UK, about conditions in Zimbabwe.Over the last few months, Zimbabweans across the UK have been asked to attend interviews at Home Office centres. When they attended they found Zimbabwean government officials waiting to interview them.One woman, who has been in the UK six years, said she attended one such interview and was told by a man speaking her native language, Shona, that she was one of thousands of Zimbabweans that the UK government wanted to remove from the country.The woman told the  that the official had a file on her, which contained her photograph and biographical details. Her relatives are politicians with the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), and one was recently arrested. “I am so anxious and I am so petrified,” she said. “If the Home Office now is sharing my details with the Zimbabweans, then they are selling my life to them.”The Home Office said “routine re-documentation interviews” often take place to establish the identity of an inidual so that travel documentation can be issued. A spokesperson said: “Where a decision has been made that a person does not require international protection removal is only enforced when we and the courts conclude that it is safe to do so, with a safe route of return.”After Mugabe was ousted, his former close aide Emmerson Mnangagwa from the same Zanu-PF party came to power. Despite hopes that his government would bring political reform, human rights activists have condemned arbitrary arrests, abductions and beatings committed by the police and military.Under Mugabe, the Zimbabwean authorities had refused to cooperate with attempts by the UK to return refused asylum seekers, declining to issue travel documents to those being asked to return to Zimbabwe against their will. This left thousands of people in legal limbo, with no legal status in the UK, so unable to work, but also unable to be returned to Zimbabwe.But Zimbabwean media reported in February 2018 that, following a meeting with the then British ambassador to Zimbabwe, Catriona Laing, the country’s new vice-president, Kembo Mohadi, said: “Zimbabwe has no problems receiving its nationals back, but would want them vetted to ensure they are genuine Zimbabweans before taking them back.”The asylum seeker charity, Assist Sheffield, said it was extremely worried about Victor Mujakachi’s safety if he were to be forcibly returned to Zimbabwe. It said he was an invaluable volunteer in many charities in the area, including its emergency night shelter, and had won awards for his charity work.“Victor is an outspoken critic of successive Zimbabwean governments and has expressed worries for his safety, should he be returned, especially given the recent brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters in the country,” the organisation said in a statement.In a recent petition to the Home Office, UK-based members of the the MDC, called on the government to give amnesty to all Zimbabweans who had been in the UK more than 10 years.“Most Zimbabweans in the UK are now settled, and they now have private and family life in the UK,” the petition said. “The issue of the Windrush generation shows that the Home Office has sometimes got it wrong, but the secretary of state has got the power to take corrective action.”Alice Muzira, a lawyer at Thompson and Co Solicitors, said the UK government should urgently review its position while there were still human rights violations in Zimbabwe. “Removals should be suspended and the situation in relation to safety of returns to Zimbabwe closely monitored,” she said.Andrew Nyamayaro, principal solicitor at Tann Law Solicitors, said: “Civilians are being tortured by members of the armed forces and the ruling party. Enforcing removals of Zimbabweans from the UK at this juncture is tantamount to sending someone to a death chamber.”Diane Abbott, Labour’s shadow home secretary, said: “The government’s resumption of deportations to Zimbabwe is in line with their hostile environment policy.

Spanish police officers raided polling stations, charged crowds with batons and fired rubber bullets in their attempts to stop the vote.On 27 October, shortly after secessionist Catalan MPs voted to declare independence, the Spanish government of the then prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, won senate backing to sack Puigdemont and his cabinet and assume direct control of Catalonia.Defence lawyers will seek to undermine the rebellion charges. They will point out that, under Spanish law, rebellion consists of “revolting violently and publicly”, and argue that none of those charged with the offence engaged in violence.Speaking to the  and a small group of other European reporters in Madrid on the eve of the trial, the Catalan president, Quim Torra, criticised the charges.The case will once again bring international attention to the enduring tensions between the Madrid government and the pro-independence regional government of Catalonia.But on Monday night, Torra said: “As far as we’re concerned, Spanish justice has pretty much zero credibility.”His sacked predecessor, meanwhile, called the trial a “stress test for Spanish democracy” and a test for the country’s judiciary.Speaking in Berlin on Tuesday, Puigdemont described his former colleagues on trial as “honourable, innocent, democratic people,” and insisted there were “no criminal violations of the Spanish criminal law”.The start of the trial led some Catalan pro-independence protesters to briefly block several roads before dawn, setting fire to tyres and holding up traffic. Protests were called in Barcelona for 7pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8acc7274bf6df03401620b17befcd178319f4d6/0_88_5241_3146/master/5241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaef4dd6d663eb0df3452bd7a04d34f5","title":"iranians mark the 40th anniversary of the islamic revolution in pictures","story":"Hundreds of thousands of students, clerics, soldiers and black-clad women holding small children thronged streets across Iran to mark the toppling of the shah – many carrying portraits of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died in 1989, and Iran’s current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Fire at former hotel showed \u0026lsquoreckless disregard for human life\u0026rsquo, says Minister for Justice\u0026lsquoWe have a real concern that some companies have been low-balling, coming in with very low tender prices to get the contract\u0026rsquoNurses and their colleagues waiting to hear the fine detail of the pay agreementInfant\u0026rsquos maternal aunt was paid by sister to look after baby and two siblings at the timeGarda\u0026iacute also seized two Audis, a Range Rover Sport and a Harley Davidson motorbikeMinute plastics found in all samples and invertebrate species in River Slaney catchmentDirector announces plans to develop festival into month-long eventJoseph Fagan (71) punched Paddy Cummins three times after leaving Four CourtsPatrick Quirke has pleaded not guilty to murder of DJ known as Mr Moonlight in Co TipperaryTwo men who assisted are being invited to the Mansion House for teaRobbie Walsh has pleaded not guilty to murder of Karl Haugh (25) in August 2017Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe outlined where \u0026euro99m will come from this year to shore up new hospital projectYasir Ali (31) pleaded not guilty to coercion in case at Dublin Circuit Criminal CourtDonal Reid\u0026rsquos hands burned patting down flames with bare hands in Donegal churchMichael D Higgins meets Prince Charles in Liverpool during latest leg of British visit\u0026lsquoI should have added further detail that the process was ongoing to finalise costs\u0026rsquoBobby Clarke (85) givings evidence to inquest examining deaths of 10 in Belfast in 1971Public service groups study implications of Labour Court recommendation in nurses\u0026rsquo disputeAs schism between UK and EU deepens, companies are caught in the middle of political brinkmanshipWRC awards woman \u0026euro5,000 over \u0026lsquopuzzling\u0026rsquo breach of trust and contract by employer"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3791317.1549987249!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gaa star hailed after dousing woman s burning coat at mass","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDonegal GAA star Donal Reid pictured  near Ballybofey, Co Donegal, in 2017.

Anybody would have done the same,” he said.Mr Reid is well known especially in GAA circles, as he was a member of the Donegal team which beat Dublin in the 1992 All-Ireland Final at Croke Park.Mr Reid, a physical therapist, wrote a memoir, Confessions of a Gaelic Footballer, in 2016."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3791423.1549991701!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lord mayor of dublin helps apprehend alleged burglar on city street","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLord Mayor of Dublin Nial Ring.

Photograph: Peter ByrnePA WirePresident Michael D Higgins has warned of a coarsening of the debate over Brexit on both sides of the Irish Sea, calling for patience and an acknowledgment of the complexity of the issues involved. Speaking in Liverpool on the second day of a three-day visit to Britain, the President said that Brexit’s critics as well as its advocates should choose their words carefully.“I think there is no benefit whatsoever in a coarsening of the language and there are indications that it is happening and I think I might plead with people for patience in relation to this. Matters that are complex require what I call mind work and that’s important,” he told The .“There isn’t any value for anybody…on the British side saying the Irish are difficult or the Irish are responsible for us not getting a deal. There’s no value whatever in it. No more is there for people indulging in some kind of ancient atavism or calling out of it atavistic echoes of saying aren’t the Brits terrible.”Mr Higgins spoke of his regret at Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, adding that its consequences had not been clearly thought out in advance. He said it was hard to see how any British government could put in place an economic framework that can match the benefits of EU membership.‘Distortions’“As a political scientist I would say there are serious issues over the quantity of information that was made available, including the distortions of information that perhaps were offered to the public who had to make a choice. And then you would go further and say well it is if you’re seeking opinion on such a complicated matter, there are responsibilities that go with it,” he said.Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina on Tuesday met Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall at the Victoria Gallery and Museum. The President and the prince are joint patrons of Liverpool University’s Institute of Irish Studies, which announced a new lectureship under their patronage.They had a 15-minute private meeting at the museum before being greeted by students, academics and others at a short reception that included readings of a letter from John McGahern to Seamus Heaney and of a poem in Irish by Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill and its English translation by Paul Muldoon.AccountableAt a lunch with business figures later, the President spoke about the value of regionalism for making the best use of resources, forming economic policy and delivering it in a politically accountable way.“We will all benefit from authentic regionalism with the capacity to ascertain possibilities and difficulties, establishing policy, make investment choices and be accountable to the people,” he said.“Such a regional approach, as you are pursuing here in Liverpool, might also foster opportunities for more bespoke co-operation and collaboration with Ireland, approaches tailored to your strengths and particular circumstances, and through which we can achieve new possibilities together.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3791214.1549983203!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unions take cautious approach on knock on pay rises","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhil Ni Sheaghdha INMO general secretary at a hearing in relation to the nurses dispute over pay and recruitment at the Labour Court, Dublin. Photo: Gareth Chaney CollinsThere has been no immediate drive by public service groups for additional pay deals similar to that secured by nurses on Monday after their recent strikes. Most public service trade unions were holding their counsel on Tuesday and indicating only that the implications of the new Labour Court recommendation, which brought about the suspension of the strike by over 40,000 nurses , were being studied.A clearer picture on whether the Government will face a series of knock-on pay claims across the State sector is likely to emerge after the public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions - the umbrella body comprising most of the public service representative associations - meets in the coming days. Some informed sources suggested that the areas in the Labour Court recommendation on nursing which will be paid closest attention by other unions are the proposals to revise arrangements put forward last September for dealing with the two-tier pay structure in place for those appointed since 2012 as well as the new proposals for the establishment of a new enhanced nurse salary scale. The Government’s initiative announced last September to end the two-tier pay system involved permitting the staff concerned to skip two points on their incremental scales - points four and eight - so that they would “catch -up “ over time with more longer-serving colleagues. However this proposal has been rejected by both the primary teachers’ union, INTO, and the union representing second level teachers, the ASTI. Neither group have yet balloted members for industrial action on the issue. The Enhanced scaleLabour Court recommendation changes this arrangement for some nurses. It provides for nurses when they reach the fourth point of their pay scale to move to a new enhanced nursemidwife practice scale if they meet certain criteria.Moving to this new scale would see them receive about €2,500 more - although this would include some money they would have received anyway under the original Government two-tier pay initiative.Sources said unions were likely to examine whether this new proposal would offer recent-entrant members more benefits than those set out in the original Government initiative last September. If they perceived this to be the case, some sources, said it was likely that unions would want the Government to match these benefits for their members.Separately some informed sources said unions were likely to seek more details on the proposed new enhanced nurse practice scale to determine whether this involved the establishment of new higher-paid public service grade.If they viewed this to be case, sources said that some unions would be likely to press for the establishment of similar new grades in their areas.ConsultationThe country’s largest union, Siptu said on Tuesday that there would be consultation with its members in the health sector as well as other parts of the public service “on the implications of the Labour Court recommendation arising from the claims submitted by the nursing unions”. Siptu deputy general secretary, John King said: “We have noted the statement by the Government that the proposals outlined in the Labour Court recommendation are consistent with the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement. We will give careful consideration to the detail of the recommendation and will be consulting widely with our members in the health ision and others across the public service in local government, education and state bodies. Siptu representatives will also be meeting with the public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the coming days to discuss the recommendation.” In a brief statement the ASTI said it would “examine the Labour Court Recommendation and related ongoing developments carefully”.The INTO said it would be looking at the Labour Court proposals.The Teachers’ Union of Ireland president Seamus Lahart said the union would analyse the Labour Court recommendation in the context of its ongoing campaign to end pay discrimination and the severe difficulties schools are experiencing in employing teachers. “Pay inequality has led to a crisis of teacher recruitment and retention in second level schools. The number applying for places on the Professional Master of Education (PME) - required to teach at second level - collapsed by over 50 per cent between 2011 and 2018.” On Monday night the largestpublic service union, Fórsa,said it would “study the detail of the Labour Court recommendation regarding the nurses’ dispute, and any implications it may have for other civil and public service grades”.

Photograph: AFP It takes three years for the whiskey produced at the Great Northern Distillery to mature. So when the company began work on the bottles that came on to the market late last year, the first it had produced, there was little concern over Brexit and no mention of a “backstop”. Now it’s difficult to think of anything else.From a standing start in 2015, the €12 million distillery in the Border town of Dundalk has made rapid progress. Demand has outstripped forecasts and the business is on track to produce 10 million litres of the spirit this year, becoming a major supplier in the industry. Yet despite the optimism, the possibility of the UK tumbling out of the EU without a deal - and its likely impact on Ireland - is difficult to escape.Many businesses across Ireland are in a similar situation. Steep World Trade Organization tariffs on valuable UK trade voluminous new customs paperwork and the risk of long delays on goods shipments to and from the European mainland that usually transit via Britain mean that Ireland has as much, if not more, to lose from a no-deal Brexit than any other nation, bar the UK.The growth markets for Great Northern’s whiskey are in the US, China and South Africa, so its sights are set on places far away from the drama in Westminster and Brussels. But the distillery is located just 10 minutes from the Border with Northern Ireland - the single most isive issue remaining in the fight over how the UK will leave the EU.London, Dublin and Brussels have all resolved that Brexit should not create new checks or a hard border to replace what is now frictionless trade across an invisible frontier that ides Northern Ireland from its southern neighbour, but they cannot agree how. The schism has taken talks to the brink of collapse, with UK prime minister Theresa May forced by Eurosceptics in her own party and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party - on which her minority government depends at Westminster - to seek concessions that Leo Varadkar’s Government and his EU allies will not countenance.Caught in the middleCompanies like Great Northern are caught in the middle of this political brinkmanship. The distillery is adjusting supply chains and stockpiling raw materials to avoid disruption. It also faces stiff new tariffs that will mean the price of some specialist ingredients from the UK will rise by more than 20 per cent if the country crashes out of the EU next month. “It’s a big wallop,” says Mr Martin.The company’s investment in Dundalk was a vote of confidence in the booming market for premium Irish whiskey and the revival of an Irish economy that had been devastated by the financial crisis. The Government is now facing the prospect of that progress being slammed into reverse, with some economists suggesting Ireland could slide into recession within 18 months of Britain crashing out of the EU on March 29th.The UK is Ireland’s biggest import partner and its second-largest export market after the US. The dispute over the “backstop” - effectively an insurance policy to keep open the Northern Irish Border, pending a new UK-EU trade deal - has also soured relations between London and Dublin that had warmed ever since the 1998 Belfast Agreement peace pact ended decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. Tony Blair, the former UK premier who signed the 1998 deal, has warned that a no-deal Brexit could be “devastating” for the peace process if a hard border were to become a target for dissident republican paramilitaries opposed to the Belfast Agreement.Mrs May is scheduled to address MPs on Tuesday to update them on her talks in Brussels and Dublin. But her abrupt decision two weeks ago to seek “alternative measures” to the backstop to win parliamentary support from the Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative party and the DUP has stirred anger in Mr Varadkar’s administration.Like Mrs May, he leads a minority government that faces severe domestic constraints, limiting his room for manoeuvre in any talks. He rejects her demands for a time-limit on the backstop and risks a political backlash at home should he make any compromise.Brussels, Berlin and Paris have been steadfast in their support for the Taoiseach. But escalating Brexit risks have sharpened Mr Varadkar’s dependence on senior European leaders like Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk, Angela Merkel and Michel Barnier, the EU’s lead Brexit negotiator. European officials insist they will stand by Mr Varadkar but there remains concern in Dublin that he could yet come under pressure to change tack at the last minute to avert a no-deal.“He’s bolstering European support by going to Brussels,” says a senior Irish official. “But nobody’s being complacent.”That attitude extends to many of the country’s largest companies that have set in train expensive contingency plans for a no-deal exit that they hope they will never have to use, instead praying for a late UK deal, or a deferral of the article 50 process.Already Mr Varadkar and Ireland’s powerful farm lobby are seeking emergency aid from Brussels to compensate for the sudden loss of beef and dairy food sales in the UK market if tariffs are imposed. The Taoiseach also wants EU state aid waivers to enable his administration to rescue stricken companies. The uncertainty has already led business to pullback. AIB, Ireland’s largest bank, said on Monday that one-third of companies have cancelled or postponed investments due to Brexit.Recovering from the crashA decade after a devastating banking crash and a humiliating international bailout, strong growth has returned. Irish gross domestic product grew 5.2 per cent in 2016 and 7.2 per cent in 2017. Government forecasts point to 7.5 per cent growth in 2018.But the country still bears the scars of the crisis that triggered years of gruelling austerity, rampant unemployment and huge taxpayer-funded bank bailouts, all of which have made Ireland more vulnerable to Brexit. Its national debt of €212.8 billion at the end of January, up from €43.7 billion before the crash, weighs heavily. At 255 per cent of Government revenue, it ranks among the largest in the eurozone.Conor O’Kelly is responsible for managing that burden. The chief of the State debt office, the National Treasury Management Agency, insisted in a recent speech that he does not need a Brexit plan, because he has no choice but to work to a “permanent” contingency plan.“Ireland is one of the most open economies in the world,” Mr O’Kelly told a business event. “We are one of the most indebted countries in the world. We rely on foreign capital for 80 to 90 per cent of our borrowing.” With a funding requirement this year of between €14 billion and €18 billion, the country’s ability to service its debts depends on maintaining market confidence in the economy.Dublin does, however, enter the Brexit endgame after recording its first budget surplus for a decade, albeit a small one. Yet dire warnings of a big economic hit in a no-deal scenario are coming with increasing regularity. The finance ministry is anxious about a “substantial” slowdown in growth and rising unemployment, saying the Irish economy could be 4.25 per cent smaller than the current projections over the medium term. The Central Bank worries about financial market turmoil, lower consumer spending and exports and transport disruption. Davy and Goodbody, the two biggest Dublin-based stockbrokers, have warned a no-deal exit could push Ireland into recession.Séamus Coffey, chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, a statutory budget watchdog, says it is too early to say whether recession is a foregone conclusion but he believes an economic slowdown is inevitable. “The Irish economy has performed so strongly over the past four or five years that it can’t be expected to continue to grow at the same rate,” he says.‘Negative atmosphere’For politicians and officials in Dublin, the schism with London over the backstop is a far cry from the relative harmony between Ireland and its former colonial power since the Belfast Agreement, itself the result of more than a decade of painstaking diplomacy.A similar close rapport between Mr Varadkar and Mrs May is unlikely. Their personal relationship lacks warmth, say political observers. And trust is in short supply. Ireland’s demand for the backstop has antagonised Mrs May but Dublin has long complained that London blithely ignored any impact of Brexit on the peace deal.Eunan O’Halpin, professor of contemporary Irish history at Trinity College Dublin, says Brexit is a considerable setback that might never be reversed. The current tension contrasts with “absolute trust” between top British and Irish officials even in the darkest moments of the conflict that left more than 3,600 dead.“In the early 1980s especially, key officials took almost personal initiatives on both sides to build up understanding of what on earth the other side was about, and what they wanted. That had very important long-term consequences and benefits.”One Varadkar ally says he is “seized of the historical moment and the potential of trying to rekindle” the damaged Anglo-Irish process. But even if the Taoiseach was open to providing a small concession to Mrs May, the problem remains that no one knows whether she could deliver support for it in the House of Commons.EndgameBack in Dundalk, Mr Martin has similar anxieties. “There’s a lot of brinkmanship at the minute. The EU seem to be right behind us. When push comes to shove, will they still be behind us? It’s a big question.”The endgame in Brexit talks comes just as Mr Varadkar’s political honeymoon runs out, 19 months after the 38-year-old became Ireland’s youngest ever premier.Although his demand for the “backstop” is popular with voters, his minority government has come under fire in recent days over a health spending controversy centred on a new children’s hospital in Dublin, Mr Varadkar’s signature infrastructure project.Costs have more than doubled to at least €1.4 billion from an estimated €636 million in 2017, prompting one opposition party, Sinn Féin, to table a confidence motion against the Minister for Health Simon Harris on Monday. Fianna Fáil, which props up the Government in parliament, has signalled their arrangement would not survive the health scandal were it not for Brexit.The public disquiet over the hospital debacle and the political tension it has stirred underline the constraints on Mr Varadkar. It coincides with a series of nursing strikes that have crippled the health system as the government refuses their demand for more pay.“The honeymoon is well and truly over,” says a Fine Gael party ally of the Taoiseach. “Fine Gael’s strength is its management of the economy and economic competence. That has taken a battering in the past week,” the ally adds, referring to the hospital.With the threat of a no-deal Brexit escalating, Mr Varadkar has rallied virtually all parties behind his stance on the backstop. The stakes are all the greater because Mr Varadkar declared in December 2017 that the original agreement on the backstop was “politically bulletproof” and “cast iron”. Having refused to discuss a time-limit on the backstop or any reopening of Theresa May’s withdrawal treaty, he would be certain to come under attack from domestic rivals if he tried to compromise. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPATaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said there are a small number of contractors who he would never like to see getting a public contract again in the State.As the Dáil continued to debate the cost overruns on the new National Children’s Hospital project Mr Varakdar said the government would look at contractors who were “lowballing” by putting in low priced contracts initially at tender stage and then putting in higher claims after they got contracts.Mr Varadkar was speaking as he came under pressure from opposition leaders in the Dáil about the handling by Minister for Health Simon Harris of the escalating costs of the planned new national children’s hospital and when he became aware of and informed his Cabinet colleagues about a €450 million increase in the cost of the project.Independent TD Michael Lowry had raised concerns about a possible conflict of interest for consultants PwC who have been commissioned to investigate the spiralling costs of the project and have been asked to report by the end of March.Mr Lowry said the consultants had received €30 million in auditing fees over the past five years from BAM, the main contractor for the new children’s hospital project.Mr Varadkar told him that there was “no conflict of interest” because PwC had not audited the company since 2015.But he said the Government had to learn lessons from the hospital costs controversy.The cost of the project has risen from an estimated €800 million in 2014, to €983 million in 2017, and €1.43 billion now. Equipping the building and providing IT pushes this bill up to €1.73 billion this does not include the cost of family accommodation, a research centre, excess construction inflation and any other changes to clinical standards.Mr Varadkar said the Cabinet decided at its Tuesday meeting to examine whether two-phase tenders should be avoided in the future. While there were advantages they “don’t know the full cost of a project until the second tender comes in”.‘Baying mob’They were also considering whether to “factor in optimism bias and promoter bias, whereby projects that people want to see delivered tend to give rise to optimism about the real cost”. He said they would also “examine the issue of low-price tenders and whether we should look more at median price because we have a real concern that some companies have been low-balling, coming in with very low tender prices to get the contract and then coming back with claims thereafter. “We also particularly want to look at contractors’ past form and public service references.”He added: “there are one or two contractors who, quite frankly, I would not like to see get a public contract again in this State.”The Taoiseach also insisted that taxpayers’ money had not been wasted on the children’s hospital.He said accountability was not about “giving in to the baying mob” or to “witch-hunts” looking for a head on a plate as he rejected Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald’s call for him to remove Mr Harris from his job.Mr Varadkar said that the Minister and he and the Government accepted responsibility for the fact that they had “underestimated the true cost of this project”.Ms McDonald described Mr Harris’s record as “frankly shambolic” and she criticised Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin for describing the escalating costs as “extraordinary” but still backing the Government on the issue.Mr Martin said the Government “can’t actually say that the taxpayer hasn’t been ripped off”. The Minister had effectively misled the Dáil and there had not been a proper explanation of why the hospital and its costs had not been put on an early warning system.Mr Varadkar said he fully understood that the public are “very annoyed at the way costs have escalated”. He pointed out that Mr Harris and the Secretary General of the Department of Health had spent hours before the health committee answering thorough questioning from opposition TDs.And he said Sinn Féin was no friend of the taxpayer because every year before the budget they ask for billions in extra taxes to be imposed on taxpayers and business."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3791070.1549978908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit may calls on mps to hold their nerve on deal","story":"UK Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday (February 12) she believed she could reach a Brexit deal that parliament could support, allowing Britain to leave the European Union on March 29.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Britain’s prime minister Theresa May listening to a reply by opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to her statement on Brexit in the House of Commons in London. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesBritish prime minister Theresa May has called on MPs to “hold their nerve” and come together behind an EU withdrawal deal which will deliver Brexit on time on March 29th.Addressing the House of Commons a fortnight after MPs voted for her to go back to Brussels and replace the backstop, Mrs May acknowledged that she would need “some time” to hold talks with the EU. The backstop would ensure there was no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland. She said that a planned House of Commons debate on Thursday will be on an amendable motion reaffirming the House’s decision on January 29th that it supported the government’s efforts to find an alternative for the backstop and recognising that talks are ongoing.Mrs May pledged to return to parliament on February 26th, if no deal has been secured before that time, to report back on progress and trigger a further MPs’ vote the following day.“We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this house requires and deliver Brexit on time,” Mrs May told the House of Commons.“By getting the changes we need to the backstop by protecting and enhancing workers’ rights and environmental protections and by enhancing the role of Parliament in the next phase of negotiations I believe we can reach a deal that this House can support.“We can deliver for the people and the communities that voted for change two-and-a-half years ago — and whose voices for too long have not been heard.“We can honour the result of the referendum.“And we can set this country on course for the bright future that every part of this United Kingdom deserves.“That is this Government’s mission. We shall not stint in our efforts to fulfil it.”Running down the clockLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the prime minister of “running down the clock” in the hope that MPs will be “blackmailed” by the fear of a no-deal Brexit into supporting “a deeply flawed deal”.“This is an irresponsible act,” said Mr Corbyn. “She is playing for time and playing with people’s jobs, our economic security and the future of our industry.”Mr Corbyn accused Mrs May of refusing to listen to his alternative deal, involving permanent customs union membership, a close alignment with the single market and matching EU workplace and environmental protections.“I urge all members across this House to think about the damage the Prime Minister’s strategy is doing — the threat to industry and skilled jobs in communities across Britain,” he said.“Now is not the time to stand idly by, now is the time to stand up and do the right thing: to rule out no deal and back Labour’s alternative plan.”PuristEarlier the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom said MPs should not be “purist” about how Mrs May secures changes to the Brexit backstop arrangement.The United Kingdom is on course to leave the European Union on March 29th without a deal unless May can convince it to amend the deal she agreed in November.Ms Leadsom, said MPs would back May’s deal if there were assurances the backstop was time-limited or the UK was allowed to leave it unilaterally, suggesting the deal itself did not need to be renegotiated. “The point is to ensure the UK cannot be held in a backstop permanently, how it’s achieved is not something to be purist about,” Ms Leadsom told BBC radio.EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Monday the EU would agree to tweak the political declaration on EU-UK ties after Brexit that forms part of the package, to reflect a plan for a closer future relationship that could obviate the need for the contentious backstop.“It’s clear from our side that we are not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement but we will continue our discussion in the coming days,” Barnier said.Running down the clock?The British parliament is set to hold a debate on Brexit on February 14th but with just 45 days until Britain leaves the bloc, no date has yet been set for another “meaningful” vote on Mrs May’s deal.Ms Leadsom said another vote would be held once the issue around the Irish backstop had been resolved.“It’s not running down the clock. The meaningful vote will come back just as soon as it possibly can,” the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, told BBC radio.She added necessary legislation needed to ensure a smooth Brexit would be in place, amid fears parliament was running out of time to approve it.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But nowhere is the prospect of regime change more likely than Sudan.Almost since the revolt began on December 19, rapidly spreading to towns and cities across Sudan, young medics have been at the forefront of the protests demanding Mr Bashir’s regisnation. They have also been among its most prominent victims, none more so than Babiker Abdelhamid, who was shot dead in Khartoum on January 17.Dr Babiker, who was 27, was only one of 45 people who have been killed by the security forces since the protests began, according to human rights groups. But the nature of his death, and the controversy it has ignited, has become a rallying call for the protesters, increasing rather than diminishing their determination to oust the president.According to witnesses, Dr Babiker walked out of his home, where he had been treating protesters,  and attempted to beg security officers to allow him to take the wounded to hospital. Moments later, a gunshot rang out and an hour later he was dead.“He walked down the street slowly, with his hands raised,” a colleague said. “He was trying to tell them he had critical cases and to ask them to reopen the road to Royal Care Hospital, which they had cut off. Then he was killed.Anti-government protesters rally in Khartoum, SudanFacing mounting outrage, President Bashir attempted to blame the killing on a foreign plot to bring chaos to Sudan. “The doctor who was killed… was killed by a weapon that did not belong to the army, or the NISS (National Intelligence and Security Services, or police,” he told supporters at a rally in the south of the country.“He was killed by someone among the demonstrators.”Yet there is no question that Sudan’s doctors, the most formidable group in a growing array of opponents to the regime, have borne the brunt of Mr Bashir’s increasingly violent and desperate response to the protests. At least one other doctor, Muawiya Khalil, has been killed, allegedly shot dead inside his house. Many more have been arrested, including the head of the Sudan Doctors Syndicate, his deputy and other members of the executive committee.Medics and nurses were beaten up after security forces raided two hospitals in Khartoum, firing live ammunition and teargas into the wards before dragging wounded protesters off their beds and taking them to secret detention centres. The assault on the medical profession partly reflects regime anger at doctors after they called a strike, encouraged other professions to follow suit and then threw open private hospitals to treat the wounded for free.But it is also an indication of the regime’s longstanding fear of the medical profession and the reverence with which it is held in Sudanese society.After seizing power in 1989, Mr Bashir banned independent trade unions, locked up and tortured opponents in secret prisons known as “ghost houses” and silenced dissent.But the doctors refused to be cowed, staging a strike within months of the coup — the regime responded by allegedly torturing to death one of the organisers at one of the ghost houses — and several more since.The medical profession’s opposition to the regime was driven by the distaste of secular doctors towards the coalition of Islamists and military figures that have run it and which allowed bin Laden to live in the country from 1991 to 1996. There was particular fury that Islamist militants were allowed to infiltrate a medical university in Khartoum, where students — including at least 16 Britons — were sent to join ISIL in Syria.But resentment is more deep-seated too. Sudan’s medical service was once among Africa’s most efficient. The Kitchener School of Medicine produced some of the continent’s best doctors.Tear gas is seen as Sudanese demonstrators take part in an an anti-government protest in KhartoumBut in recent decades, the health system has all but collapsed. As the Bashir regime erted government funds towards the military, slashing health expenditure to just two percent of the budget, once-functioning state hospitals became understaffed and poorly equipped. Medicines ran in short supply, free healthcare was mostly abandoned. Corrupt government officials plundered hospitals and ran dodgy procurement tenders. Unable to save lives, doctors were sometimes beaten up by the parents of children who had died in their care.Doctors’ attempts to galvanise public anger largely failed, however, with many Sudanese still too scared to confront their government. But an economic crisis in recent years, the legacy of US sanctions, lifted in 2016, and economic mismanagement in a country ranked by Transparency International as among the six most corrupt in the world, has changed the dynamic. Starved of cash, the government began printing money, sending inflation soaring to 70 percent, second only to Venezuela.Forced to adopt austerity measures, Mr Bashir lifted subsidies on basic staples, causing bread prices to treble. The rapid devaluation of the Sudanese pound had meant that the price of medicines, which are mostly imported, soaring by between 150 percent and 300 percent in the last 12 months.December’s protests began spontaneously in the city of Atbara, but they were quickly given direction and purpose by the Sudanese Professionals Organisation, an umbrella group dominated by doctors, which has marshalled near daily protests and industrial action across the country.“Demands for major healthcare changes have been repeatedly ignored over the year,” doctors’ groups said in a statement. “There has been a blatant policy of  systematically destroying the once free national health service. Our only option, coupled by our professional duty, was to escalate our protests.”The Bashir regime has thwarted previous protests, killing some 180 people during the last significant uprising in 2013. Yet Sudan observers say that, this time, the fear factor has been broken, with violence increasing rather than deterring the protesters’ determination.Other professionals have joined demands for Mr Bashir’s resignation, including professors at Khartoum University, another hallowed colonial institution that began its days as the Gordon Memorial College in 1902. Other groups, most significantly dock workers at Port Sudan, have joined the strikes.And even Sudan’s normally cautious opposition, sensing Mr Bashir’s growing vulnerability, has come out in support of the protests. Last week, Sadiq al-Mahdi, the bearded Oxford-educated former prime minister overthrown by Mr Bashir in 1989, demanded the president’s resignation.A Sudanese protester carries a portrait of President Omar al-Bashir with Arabic writing that reads \u0026#34down and that is all\u0026#34 Some observers see Mr al-Mahdi, great-grandson of Muhammad Ahmed, the Mahdi whose warriors killed General Gordon in Khartoum in 1885, as a potential candidate to head a transitional government — even though he is 83.President Bashir is not beaten yet. Middle Eastern states say they support the regime and Qatar, which has embarked on a multi-million pound development of the British-built port at Suakin, may bail him out financially. Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-linked outfit that has fought in Syria and Ukraine, have been spotted in Khartoum and are possibly assisting the regime’s repression.Yet there are rumours of splits within the regime, with even some of his generals reportedly sensing that only by sacrificing Mr Bashir will the protests, increasingly well organised and ever more determined, end.Some observers say there may be a peaceful way out, with suggestions that the president would be willing to step down if the International Criminal Court dropped its case accusing him of involvement in killing hundreds of thousands during the suppression of a rebellion in the Darfur region.Mohammed Ibrahim, a Sudanese-British billionaire and prominent critic of the Bashir regime, has led calls for the indictment to be lifted, warning that otherwise the demise of one of the Arab world’s most stubborn leaders is likely to be protracted and violent affair.“If that is going to save lives, if it is going to save us from a bloody civil war, let the man go in peace,” Mr Ibrahim told the BBC.Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Upskirting now a criminal offence as Theresa May praises \u0026#39tireless\u0026#39 campaignersEl Chapo guilty: How the drug lord\u0026#39s vast narco empire trial captivated USAverage university vice chancellor now earns more than £250k for first time, as majority given pay rises in last year despite criticismComment: MPs know Theresa May is playing them for fools on Brexit... yet still they don’t actTelephone scammer caught when he targeted the only person to lead both the FBI and the CIAGuy Verhofstadt warns Brexiteers could end up on the guillotine like the leaders of the French RevolutionHow secret network of tunnels helped drugs kingpin El Chapo evade policeComment: Is Peppa Pig really what it takes to teach Americans how to speak English?Joaquin \u0026#39El Chapo\u0026#39 Guzman found guilty of drug trafficking by New York courtScientists given green light to resume research on lethal flu pathogenValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: The history behind the romantic dateTate Modern neighbours who said viewing platform made then feel like zoo specimens lose privacy battle French media faces #MeToo moment as senior male journalists suspended for trolling womenFormer Royal Marine sues MoD for hearing loss, in case that could cost millionsUN tells Belgium to apologise for its colonial past in Congo Comment: Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May already agree on Brexit.

But this scheme, which costs £745million a year, is due to finish in June 2020. Greg Dyke was the BBC\u0027s most senior journalist when Gordon Brown as Labour Chancellor introduced the free TV licences in 2001. He told Radio 4\u0027s Today programme the BBC\u0027s governors should now take the difficult decision to change the whole system. He said: I think the idea that they\u0027re going to give the baby boomers, when they reach 75, a free licence is ridiculous.Mr Dyke, who later went on to serve as the Football Association\u0027s chairman from 2013 to 2016, also said the decision should be made by an independent panel, and not those with a vested interest in the BBC. He told Today: Personally, I think the governors should take the unpopular but tough decision to restrict any subsidy to any over-75s apart from the very poorest. In a world when the poorest aren\u0027t necessarily the oldest, I don\u0027t see any justification to continue to the whole system.You have this ridiculous situation where if your elderly mother or father who is over 75 comes to live with you, you no longer pay a license fee. It doesn\u0027t make sense. Mr Dyke then added: John Humphrys and me - we\u0027re all coming up to that age. Why in five years tome should I be getting a free TV licence? I, and a lot of people my age, will be able to afford it. But younger people in work who are poor - why should they be paying for the TV licenses of people who are much richer than them? The former director general, from 2000 to 2004, said the initial decision to subsidise the over-75s was a mistake. But the plans to scrap the free licence fee for the over-75s could push more than 50,000 pensioners into poverty, a leading charity has warned.Age UK called on the Government to take back responsibility for annual £745million cost of the free TV licences policy to ensure the perk continued to be funded. Some 4.45million over-75s have TV licences according to TV Licensing. The proposal, one of four ideas being considered, is part of a cost saving initiative to take over funding licence fees from the government in 2020.The charity warned that an additional bill of £150.50 – the current cost of an annual TV licence  – “will undoubtedly cause great worry and distress” to pensioners.Based on data from the Family Resources Survey it estimated that 51,041 adults aged 65 and older will be pushed into hardship, including all people aged over-65 living in households with a person aged over-75 and which therefore currently qualify for a free TV licence. There were 4,455,000 over-75s licences in force last year according to TV Licensing. The cut would potentially forcing them to cut back on other essentials such as heating and food in order to remain informed, entertained, stimulated and connected to the world beyond their doorstep, according to Age UK. Caroline Abrahams, Age UK’s charity director, said: “Scrapping the free TV licence would be a real blow for many older people who already have many other challenges to contend with. “Millions of older people, particularly those who are lonely or housebound with disabilities, rely on their TV as their trusted companion and window on the world, and it would be cruel indeed to undermine this in any way.”The BBC’s consultation on the future of free TV licences for older people is running for 12 weeks – due to end on 12th February 2019, with a decision expected by the summer.A BBC spokesman said: “This is a really important issue. We\u0027re conscious that pensioner poverty is still an issue for some older people.“We have set out a range of options in our consultation - each has merits and consequences, with implications for the future of the BBC and for everyone, including older people.“We need to hear everyone’s views to help the BBC make the best and fairest decision.Upskirting now a criminal offence as Theresa May praises \u0026#39tireless\u0026#39 campaignersEl Chapo guilty: How the drug lord\u0026#39s vast narco empire trial captivated USAverage university vice chancellor now earns more than £250k for first time, as majority given pay rises in last year despite criticismComment: MPs know Theresa May is playing them for fools on Brexit... yet still they don’t actTelephone scammer caught when he targeted the only person to lead both the FBI and the CIAGuy Verhofstadt warns Brexiteers could end up on the guillotine like the leaders of the French RevolutionHow secret network of tunnels helped drugs kingpin El Chapo evade policeComment: Is Peppa Pig really what it takes to teach Americans how to speak English?Joaquin \u0026#39El Chapo\u0026#39 Guzman found guilty of drug trafficking by New York courtScientists given green light to resume research on lethal flu pathogenValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: The history behind the romantic dateTate Modern neighbours who said viewing platform made then feel like zoo specimens lose privacy battle French media faces #MeToo moment as senior male journalists suspended for trolling womenFormer Royal Marine sues MoD for hearing loss, in case that could cost millionsUN tells Belgium to apologise for its colonial past in Congo Comment: Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May already agree on Brexit.

The Dutch study is awaiting funding.The researchers modified the avian virus so that it could spread between ferrets in a bid to understand what mutations were required for it to become transmissible between humans. Ferrets are often used as a surrogate for humans in the study of airborne diseases because their respiratory tracts are remarkably similar and they contract the same viruses.One of the researchers, Ron Fouchier, from Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands, told the journal Science at the time his research was published that the modified strain was “probably one of the most dangerous viruses you can make”.  The threat of a “weaponised” pathogen spreading around the world has long been the stuff of nightmares. In 2017, Microsoft founder turned philanthropist Bill Gates warned that “a fast-moving airborne pathogen could kill more than 30 million people in less than a year”.A century of deadly outbreaksH5N1  has a high death toll but there is as yet no evidence of sustained transmission between humans. As of the end of January this year there had been 860 cases of the disease among humans since 2003, including 450 deaths. The last reported cases in humans were in 2017.The vast majority of human cases have involved close contact with infected or sick birds or their faecal products in markets in Asia or in backyard smallholdings.In 2014 the US government ordered a pause on funding such studies - known as “gain-of-function” research - into flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, over fears about the potential for the spread of a virus of “enhanced pathogenicity”.At the time there were also high-profile breaches of safety in laboratories handling anthrax and smallpox viruses, adding to the fear over the potential for an accident involving a dangerous pathogen.But now, the United States Department for Health and Human Services said the studies can resume as long as certain conditions on safety measures and communication plans are met although a spokeswoman could not give more details.Virus hunters | Meet the scientists searching for Disease XIn a review of research on pathogens with pandemic potential published last year the department said that the research was “essential to protecting global health and security. However, there were important biosafety and biosecurity measures to take into account. The review said that any research should be evaluated by an independent expert panel, that the pathogen had to be a “credible source” for a potential human pandemic and that containment measures were strong.  Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said gain-of-function studies were interesting although of limited use.These studies don\u0027t tell us how the virus will behave in nature and even in humans. You cannot predict how a virus is going to mutate. I don\u0027t think the benefits outweigh the risks of generating a virus that can spread between humans and could potentially be lethal, he said.You can never guarantee that a virus will not escape. The containment facilities will mean that it would be incredibly difficult but accidents can happen and people can mislabel bottles. And if you put information in the public domain rogue actors or states could copy it - it\u0027s not rocket science, he said. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Pandemics and epidemicsCouncils given new powers to block phone boxes being built  Residents of Russian town invaded by polar bears forced to patrol streets and travel only by carUpskirting now a criminal offence as Theresa May praises \u0026#39tireless\u0026#39 campaignersEl Chapo guilty: How the drug lord\u0026#39s vast narco empire trial captivated USAverage university vice chancellor now earns more than £250k for first time, as majority given pay rises in last year despite criticismComment: MPs know Theresa May is playing them for fools on Brexit... yet still they don’t actTelephone scammer caught when he targeted the only person to lead both the FBI and the CIAGuy Verhofstadt warns Brexiteers could end up on the guillotine like the leaders of the French RevolutionHow secret network of tunnels helped drugs kingpin El Chapo evade policeComment: Is Peppa Pig really what it takes to teach Americans how to speak English?Joaquin \u0026#39El Chapo\u0026#39 Guzman found guilty of drug trafficking by New York courtValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: The history behind the romantic dateTate Modern neighbours who said viewing platform made then feel like zoo specimens lose privacy battle French media faces #MeToo moment as senior male journalists suspended for trolling womenFormer Royal Marine sues MoD for hearing loss, in case that could cost millionsUN tells Belgium to apologise for its colonial past in Congo Comment: Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May already agree on Brexit.

The hunt for such alternatives inevitably leads to examples of other borders and it is usually only a matter of time before someone volunteers the Switzerland-France border as a model. Switzerland is in Schengen (so no need for passport checks) and regulations on goods are broadly aligned with those of the EU. Switzerland is not in the EU’s customs union nor its VAT regime, and that means border checks are required. Its watches and cuckoo clocks literally run like clockwork, so, the argument goes, must its borders.But it’s not as simple as that. As the Swiss Federal Customs Administration makes clear, even though they have the latest technology and much paperwork is done away from the border, there is still some physical infrastructure and delays of up to four hours if a lorry is searched.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 2018 Switzerland launched a new IT-based customs transformation programme. This programme aims to simplify, harmonise and fully digitise customs tax and duty collection processes. It should be in place by 2026.However, this programme will not make controls at the border redundant. Quite the opposite. Because routine administrative work and bureaucratic procedures will be replaced by IT-based solutions, personnel will be freed up. These people will be used to strengthen security, especially for control functions and reinforcement of criminal prosecution. Some of these functions will continue to apply at the border. Hence, even with a highly technologically advanced customs management system, controls at the border will not become obsolete and nor will customs infrastructure vanish.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

Norway is not in the customs union either, so the origin of goods must be checked. Again, Norwegian Customs make clear what is required. Although it is technologically advanced, there is still a delay. The average time from when a lorry arrives at the border to when it leaves is about 20 minutes. This includes roughly ten minutes waiting time, three to six minutes of handling time, and the time spent coming off the road to complete the customs process. And there’s physical infrastructure too. All this despite existing agreements on customs facilitation, transit and rules of origin between the EU and the European Free Trade Association states, of which Norway is one.Less often talked about are Andorra and San Marino. Both are small European nations that are in a customs union with the EU. Although Andorra’s treaty only covers goods, its borders with Spain and France are strictly controlled. This is due to the fact that Andorra has no VAT (yet) and is known as low tax territory. Thus, smuggling has always been a concern of the neighbouring countries. The customs union with San Marino covers all goods except coal and steel. It has traditionally kept an open border without checks at its frontier with Italy. However, it levies an import tax, at 17 per cent.The Bulgaria-Turkey border is worse. Turkey is in a customs union with the EU, which removes tariffs and quantitative restrictions in bilateral trade between EU member states and Turkey for the goods covered. It also sets a single external tariff for both the EU and Turkey, so they charge the same duties on imports from non-EU countries.Unlike the customs union covering EU member states, the EU-Turkey agreement is incomplete. It covers industrial goods but not agricultural products (except certain processed agricultural products), coal and steel products, or public procurement.Finally, the border between Turkey and the EU is bureaucratic and lengthy. Lorry drivers need an export declaration, a customs permit, invoices for the products they are transporting, insurance certificates and a transport permit for each EU nation they will drive through. The queues at the border can be up to 17 kilometres long and the wait as much as 30 hours. While Turkey has invested significantly in modernising its border, with checks taking place an hour inland, Bulgarian officials check the paperwork for every truck and x-ray all refrigerated lorries.Which brings us to the US-Canada border. Again, much resource has been put into streamlining this border but there are still delays - the length can be seen online.

What began as a startup is now one of London’s leading destinations for yoga and\u0026nbsppilates, with five studios across the capital and more than 750 classes per week.Created with Sketch.Yoga Inc. The phenomenal popularity of yoga Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sattin had no initial plans to work in the wellbeing industry. “My father was a doctor and really wanted one of his three sons to follow in his footsteps,” he says.“For years, I thought that’s what I was going to do too. But I ended up going to law school and eventually became a lawyer, setting up my own practice when I was 27.”Looking for a better way to relax while studying, Sattin taught himself to meditate and the seeds for an altogether different life were sewn – not that he knew it at the time. In 1985, one of his colleagues who thought he was a little “left of centre” suggested he try yoga and sent Sattin to a private class in northwest London. The experience turned out to be life-changing.Sattin says: “It might sound clichéd but it’s one of these experiences that become more profound when you look back at them. At the time, I just realised instantly that I needed to change.“I was a heavy smoker, I used to smoke 40 cigarettes a day and a drink about 14 cups of coffee with two sugars each. Within three months of practising I quit all of that.” “It wasn’t that I suddenly gave up practising law, shaved my head and wore orange robes, but it was a catalyst for change. It encouraged me to do better.”After 18 years of practising law he decided he had enough in 1996. Sattin agreed to a year’s notice, which gave him time to think about his next steps. He says: “I was involved in the set up of Yo! Sushi and Protocol Multimedia Talent Agency. I was talking to some friends in Los Angeles, who said, ‘Why don’t you do what you love?’ and I realised yoga was what I was the most interested in.” He travelled to the US to see how studios like YogaWorks in Los Angeles and Jivamukti yoga in New York operated. “The aim was to see what they were doing wrong and what I could learn from their mistakes,” Sattin says.“Once I got the concept, I was very passionate about doing it and when you have that passion, people want you to succeed,” he adds.Sattin used his network to fund the company and managed to raise £500,000. In 2000, with the help of a company board, some of whose members he found while walking his golden retriever in Regent’s Park, the first Triyoga studio in Primrose Hill was born.Early investors included David Svendsen, who was then chair\u0026nbspof Microsoft, while Simon Low joined the company to be director of yoga, a role he kept until 2002.If you are a little shy about stepping inside this impressive mecca for yogis, you shouldn’t be. The whole concept was to create a place for all.Sattin says: “From the beginning, the idea was to create a place where anyone could practice yoga. It had to be authentic and we also wanted to have a wide range of classes. I knew from my own experience that people want different things at different times. The number of people who attend Triyoga classes each year“Sometimes you might want something dynamic and sometimes you might want something restorative. We wanted to help our customers to find the type of practice that was appropriate for them.” With its proximity to the London homes of Sadie Frost and Gwyneth Paltrow, who have both attended classes there, the Primrose Hill centre quickly become a byword for glamour – an image that Sattin is visibly uncomfortable with.He says: “When we first opened, our studio Primrose Hill wasn’t quite as cool and glamorous as it is now. It had the feeling of a village and it was quite awkward to get there. It was interesting as an area. We never sought to attract celebrities, our aim was to give time and space to practice to anyone that comes through our doors.” For the\u0026nbspfirst full year, the company’s turnover was £393,000, and in 2017 this jumped to an impressive £6.2m.\u0026nbspMore than 600,000 people attend Triyoga classes every year and in 2015 it opened a\u0026nbspteacher-training academy.A branch opened in Covent Garden in 2003, followed by Soho in 2005, and another two studios in Shoreditch and Ealing opened their doors in 2017.Of course, there were also some obstacles. Triyoga was forced out of its coveted location in Primrose Hill after losing a three-year battle against a development firm. Fortunately, Sattin promptly found an alternative venue in Camden in an old piano factory in Jamestown Road – a short walk away from its original location.Each studio now has a café and a shop. The company also offers teacher training, retreats and holidays. Sattin says: “As we’ve expanded, we’ve tried to get better, and improve our service and our offering. We always had changing rooms and showers – which was quite unusual at the time. But we’ve added cafés, shops and more treatments.“Essentially, we wanted our customers to have a comfy space where they wanted to stay and hangout. We wanted them to feel like they were part of something.” The market has changed considerably since Triyoga first opened its doors nearly 20 years ago. Competition might be more brutal than ever – but Sattin says the quality of the teaching at Triyoga is what makes them different from rivals.He says: “We are passionate with the quality of our teaching and our treatments. We now have 122 teachers, not including those who come for guest’s lessons.“We look at how qualified they are, but also if they teach the way that is right for us. As a basic rule our teachers need to have a minimum of five years’ experience. Each one goes through a thorough interview process and also teaches a class to the team and to our clients.”The company may not have embraced goat yoga, but it has been quick to evolve with the times – last year, Triyoga spearheaded an initiative for Consent Cards, the first of its kind, in response to the #MeToo movement. Sattin explains: “In yoga, some of our students may wish to be corrected, but others just prefer not to be touched. “These allow all students to put a card on their mat, so if they don’t want to be adjusted, the teacher knows without them having to say anything.”The company hosts a triyoga podcast, which Sattin says is all about confronting issues in the wellness world head-on. This include debates about yoga practices in a #MeToo era and the complex relationship between contemporary yoga and eating disorders.Perhaps it is down to the calming effect of yoga, but Sattin is refreshingly humble when talking about the centre’s success. When asked about oversea expansion plans, he says: “We don’t have plans to expand outside of the UK for now. I want to keep our values and continue investing in the right people, look at how we can improve our service and provide even better care for our clients.”We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

This is a bridging loan and it’s priced like one. There are provisions for that price to go up if a more permanent solution to the company’s problems doesn’t get found quickly, so the can can’t be kicked for long. If that looks a lot\u0026nbsplike Brexit to you, you wouldn\u0027t be alone in drawing the parallel.\u0026nbspMike Ashley, the\u0026nbspbiggest shareholder via his Sports Direct, offered a similar sum interest free over Christmas. The problem is that it came with strings.\u0026nbspI imagine the group’s other shareholders would prefer the devils they know among their lenders if the alternative is Ashley’s deep blue sea, regardless of the high price they’re exacting.\u0026nbspBut the company might still end up there. It is hobbled by more than £500m of debt and a lot of underperforming stores with high rents that it needs to close.\u0026nbspThe shares’ rapturous response to the lifeline needs to be put in context. Debenhams has become catnip to short sellers betting on its demise, not to mention other gamblers hoping to make a turn on the stock market rollercoaster companies in this sort of situation tend to ride.\u0026nbspSome of them will have closed out their positions as a result of the financing\u0026nbspit has secured, helping to push the shares sharply higher. But future for investors with a time horizon longer than five minutes is cloudy indeed.At about £50m, Debenhams’ market value is less than a tenth of its debt, which it needs to reduce. The options for doing that include some type of debt for equity swap, or a company voluntary arrangement, which is a form of insolvency.\u0026nbspInvestors are going to get clobbered whatever finally emerges. They’ve been squabbling with each other, and Ashley managed to get CEO Sergio Bucher, who must wish he’d stayed put at Amazon, booted off the board a while back.\u0026nbspThe company is in a bad situation, going into talks abut its future with a bad hand while its stakeholders are bitterly ided.

Come at me, says David BarnettClick to followThe IndependentOasis’s London debut at the Water Rats, January 1994There will be those who have just read the headline and already gone directly to the comments to take issue. For any waverers, I’ll set out my stall again: 1994 was the best year in music. Possibly ever.\u0026nbspStill here? Right, we happy few, let’s unpack this a little. Putting the words “best” and “music” together is always going to be subjective. One woman’s Metallica is another man’s Joe Dolce. And there’s also time and place to take into account. If you were six years old in 1994, you might not have been bothered about contemporary pop. If you were 76, maybe ditto. But there are certain immutable, irrefutable truths, and this is one of them. The year 1994 was spectacular for music on so, so many levels.Perhaps a bit of wider context is needed. To live through 1994 as a relatively young person (I turned 24 in the January) was to be at the centre of what felt like a time of transcendent change in the UK.That was the year the IRA ceasefire was signed, and 911 was still seven years away, and not on on our radar at all. After the breakup of the Soviet Union three years earlier, Russia was more interested in implementing democracy and capitalism than fighting a Cold War. It felt like the dawn of an age – sadly short-lived – when nobody was trying to blow us up.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 1994, Bill Clinton was in the White House, and still a year away from staining his character (and a dress) by not having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. Neil Kinnock’s Labour had somehow lost the 1992 general election, despite everyone being confident the Tory stranglehold was finally over, but in 1994 Labour named Tony Blair as leader of the party, and things...\u0026nbspwell, things could only get better.To live through 1994 as a relatively young person ... was to be at the centre of what felt like a time of transcendent change in the UKAfter what seemed like years of stagnation, there was a whiff of change in the air. Things felt in some way more optimistic. The country felt more inclusive, less isive. There was opportunity, and expectation. It was the year they launched the National Lottery. Any one of us could become a multimillionaire by buying a ticket for a quid.And music reflected this, as it always reflects the world around it. There was a sensation of rapid, almost out-of-control evolution in music. People’s record collections became more eclectic, more wide-ranging, more small-c catholic. The old boundaries seemed to melt away. You didn’t need to choose between being a rocker or a raver or an indie-kid or a popster. You could be all of them at once, because if the bands and artists were refusing to stay in their pigeonholes, why should the public?Why we haven’t had a decent Christmas song since 1994Slap bang in the middle of the year, at the Glastonbury Festival at the end of June, I stood in a field and had a transformative experience watching the progressive techno band Orbital playing a set to what felt like half the people in the world. They had come to Glastonbury to see Oasis, or Rage Against the Machine they had come for Björk and James. They had come to listen to Nick Cave, to jump around to Blur, to dance to M People. And in the end, they all came to watch Orbital playing their bleepy, unnerving, bass-pounding music of the spheres, and for what felt like the first time ever the tribes were all united in the love of music.Of course, that could just be the drugs talking. But look at that Glastonbury line-up! Just one year, one scorching hot June weekend! And you can add to that list St Etienne, Paul Weller, Pulp, Spirtualised, Radiohead...\u0026nbsppossibly the best Glastonbury ever, in the year of the best music ever?That coming together at the Orbital set heralded a sea change for Glastonbury. According to Sheryl Garratt’s excellent book detailing the rise of rave culture, Adventures in Wonderland, Glasto organiser Michael Eavis had previously shied away from having a dance stage because of the negative connotations attached to rave and techno – primarily the drugs, illegal events and mass takeovers at places like Castlemorton two years previously.She wrote: “But after Orbital’s live set stole the show in 1994, a dance stage and dance tents were finally introduced the following year, and Glastonbury has become an annual event on the club calendar.”If I had to fight with myself over this bold claim for 1994 to be music’s finest year, I’d probably employ maybe 1988 as my weapon of choice. That was really the start of rave culture, and where dance music began to cross over with guitar bands, resulting in the baggy Madchester sound epitomised by the Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses, James and\u0026nbspthe Inspiral Carpets.But while that might have been where the seeds of fusion of the genres and inclusivity were sown, I’d argue that it wasn’t until 1994 that those ideas and concepts properly blossomed. And, of course, 1994 was the year of Britpop.It was actually in 1993 that Britpop got going, thanks to a feature in the now defunct music magazine Select. Grunge, with its poster boys Nirvana and their lead singer Kurt Cobain (more of whom anon) had held sway with its nihilistic, fuzzy guitars in Britain for a couple of years among an army of plaid-wearing, chain-smoking disaffected youth. But Select wanted to wave the flag for Blighty, quite literally as that month’s issue featured on its cover Suede’s Brett Anderson against a union jack background and an article\u0026nbspinside headlined, “Who Do You Think You Are Kidding, Mr Cobain?”. Denim, Pulp, Suede, The Auteurs and St Etienne were all featured, in a bid to push British pop back up the agenda.By 1994, two seminal Britpop albums went head to head – as did the bands responsible for them. Oasis released their debut Definitely Maybe, while Blur brought out their third LP, Parklife. Oasis v Blur bubbled under throughout the year, battle lines drawn at the Watford Gap. It was the naughty north vs the sexy south, Manchester’s Oasis and their Beatlesque anthems set against Blur’s cheeky chappy Camden Kinks roisterers. By the following year, the so-called rivalry even made the BBC evening news as the two bands released singles on the same day.If there ever was any proper animosity between Oasis and Blur, it didn’t extend to the fans. Blur or Oasis might have been a perennial pub debate throughout 1994, but I don’t think I knew anyone who didn’t own both Definitely Maybe and Parklife. The rivalry added a bit of spice, and music fans were the winners with two defining albums of the decade.Britpop wasn’t only about Blur and Oasis, of course, though as the cocky lads in the class they tended to get most of the attention. But let us consider some of the other releases that came under the red-white-and-blue Britpop banner:\u0026nbspPulp’s His ’n’\u0026nbspHers, considered to be the album that brought them to mainstream attention, especially for the standout tracks “Do You Remember the First Time?” and “Babies”\u0026nbspEchobelly’s debut Everyone’s Got One, with its spiky, caustic, feminist songs Suede’s second album Dog Man Star, which perhaps exemplified how bands were not afraid to evolve and transform in 1994. Suede’s first album was almost a paean to Bowie with a side order of The Smiths here they’d gone much more personal and perhaps introspective.Another band that completely reinvented itself in 1994 was Primal Scream. Never a band to stick with one musical style, they had, however, found a niche in the dance-rock mash-ups of 1991’s Screamadelica. When they returned in ’94 with Give Out But Don’t Give Up, it could not have been further from the blissed-out rhythms of “Loaded” and “Higher Than the Sun”. The Scream had gone full-on Rolling Stones blues, and the\u0026nbspfirst single from the album, “Rocks”, was the band’s highest-charting release.Had 1994 given us only Britpop, the year would still have deserved a place in posterity. But it was about so much more than that. Select magazine might have jokingly tried to drive America back into the sea the previous year, but US bands released some absolutely classic albums that year.What about Green Day’s Dookie, and its single “Basket Case”? By 1994, REM were stone-cold alt-rock royalty, and while their ninth studio album Monster might not be in everyone’s top five REM albums, it did at least give us the single “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?”. Weezer released their self-titled debut, and Beck gave us the unalloyed eclectic joy of Mellow Gold and the single “Loser”.But the most influential American band of the era, Nirvana, came to a tragic end when, in April,\u0026nbspleader Kurt Cobain wrote a note to his imaginary childhood friend and then put a shotgun to his chin and pulled the trigger. He had gone and joined that stupid club, the one where the most talented musicians of a generation end their own lives at the age of 27. Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison. The year\u0026nbsphad its martyr.This was also the year that music fans who’d previously filled their CD racks with white boys playing guitars began to embrace rap and hip-hop\u0026nbsp– and also when hip-hop transformed, Kafka-like, into something quite new.Then Notorious BIG\u0026nbspreleased his debut Ready to Die, and indeed he did, becoming the martyr of 1997 a few years later. Public Enemy brought out their highly acclaimed fifth studio album, Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age, and the Beastie Boys fused hip hop with the greatest 1970s police detective show that never was with the video to their single “Sabotage”.In Britain, this acceptance of rap into the music collections of the largely white indie-kid audience led to the birth of something else we can thank 1994 for: trip-hop.The term was coined that year by a Mixmag journalist to describe the bass-heavy fusion of hip-hop and dance music that was largely coming out of Bristol. Massive Attack had already released the seminal Blue Lines album and the evergreen “Unfinished Sympathy” in 1991, but this year saw their second album Protection, and its standout single release “Karmacoma”. But the year was most notable for Portishead’s debut, Dummy, drenched in blue and heartbreak, and the soundtrack to a thousand all-back-to-mine post-club chillouts.What else? Well, we could still get away with forgiving Morrissey a lot back in 1994, especially with his fourth solo album Vauxhall and I. The Manic Street Preachers released The Holy Bible, the last work to feature troubled lyricist and guitarist Richey Edwards. The following year he would go missing, never to be found, making a martyr of a more introspective kind than Cobain’s dramatic exit. The old-stagers were keeping on keeping on, with albums from Madonna and the Rolling Stones, and even a wealth of previously unheard Beatles material from their sessions at the BBC.But if there was one comeback that exemplified 1994, it had to be The Stone Roses. Their self-titled debut album in 1989 soundtracked a generation. Their return five years later had a lot riding on it in terms of expectations. So, of course, they titled it The Second Coming.Bill Gates basically predicted rise of Netflix and Facebook in 1994Read this full unedited Tom Petty interview published in 1994Was it ever going to be as good as The Stone Roses? No, of course not, because that album was perfection. But with singles such as “Love Spreads” and “Ten Storey Love Song”, they made a pretty good fist of it. But it was an event, it was exciting, it was history-making. And it was brave and reckless and so typically Stone Roses\u0026nbspto release their first new album for years when everyone had all but written them off, and especially to do that in the greatest year for music ever.Without the benefit of the internet or smartphones, we discovered new music in 1994, we heard it in the pubs and at gigs and in clubs and festivals and on John Peel’s radio show. We bought indie music then we went to Creamfields or to superclubs in places like Leeds, and danced until dawn.Techno got hard and heavy. The aforementioned Orbital released Snivilisation, a growling, science-fiction nightmare of an album. The government tried to kill off rave culture good and proper with the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which drove people into the clubs but also earned a response from the Prodigy in the form of Music for the Jilted Generation, a howling, psychopathic protest album that gifted us the insane energy of “No Good (Start the Dance)” and “Voodoo People”. The Chemical Brothers, under the name the Dust Brothers, started releasing singles. Dance music became raw and scary, a self-fulfilling prophecy for those in positions of authority that thought they simply had to ban it.Music in 1994 was a erse mess, just like it always is. But it seemed as if there was an invisible thread running through all these genres\u0026nbspthat connected people through a general love of music. You might love Oasis more than the Prodigy, or Blur more than Portishead, but the chances are you listened to all of it. The year was about invention, about reinvention, about throwing open the doors and just trying everything. It was involving and inclusive and seems to shine so very brightly from the vantage point of today.\u0026nbspThe obvious answer to all this is that I am just old and clinging on to a year that seemed glorious just because I was there. But I insist: 1994 was the best year ever for music, and its spirit is something we could sorely do with today.

Adam Lusher meets themClick to followThe Independent‘Shiny ornaments in the town centre’: The EU-funded ‘Heart of the Furnace’ sculpture, with the signs for BrightHouse and Poundstretcher behindThis was the crucible that drove the industrial revolution, once.It was a valley blessed with mineral wealth in abundance, enough for men to dig out\u0026nbsp2\u0026nbspmillion tons of coal a year.The\u0026nbspsteelworks in Ebbw Vale could lay claim to being the biggest in Europe: 11,000 people working there in the 1960s, amid “the noise from the tinplate lines, the smell of acid used to clean steel coils, the sight of a hot ingot, as bright as the sun, being reduced to a thin steel slab”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAs one of its former MPs would recall, in Blaenau Gwent, in the south Wales valleys, the work was hard – and dangerous – but it built communities.Wales might not get as much money from Brexit as it did from the EUYet the steelworks have gone, demolished in 2002. The mines have shut.Marine was the last pit to go, closed in 1989.\u0026nbspIts only visible remains lie in a patch of wasteland beyond a dead-end road.\u0026nbspTwo large wheels rise above the ground.\u0026nbspOnce they were in constant motion, bringing up the coal and sending down the men to work in a pit that operated around the clock. The wheels have been sawn in half, encased in concrete, immobilised forever.\u0026nbspInstead of the sounds of work, there is silence.Where once Blaenau Gwent was full of the signs of heavy industry, now it is peppered with signs of a different kind: showing the stars of the\u0026nbspEU\u0026nbspflag, promising economic rebirth, offering uplifting slogans about “investing in your future”.And herein lies the paradox. Blaenau Gwent is in the heart of a region, the south Wales valleys, that has received\u0026nbspsome £4bn of EU funding over 20 years, and yet it is also the local council area that recorded Wales’s heaviest Leave vote, with 62 per cent backing Brexit in 2016.Reporters have visited from London, minds boggling at the place “showered with EU cash” that voted Leave, concluding – some of them – that the people here must be Brexit\u0026nbsp“turkeys who voted for Christmas”.They are not hard to find, these “turkeys”. You just back out of the dead-end road leading to the remains of Marine colliery and drive for a few minutes to the Legion pub in\u0026nbspCwm, where, for the benefit of the lunchtime drinkers, the widescreen TV is tuned to a radio station playing the hits of yesteryear.Dale Owen, 47, was a boy when the miners went on strike and the last pits closed under the government of Margaret Thatcher.\u0026nbspToo young to follow his father and grandfather down the pit, he became a painter and decorator.“I’m fed up and I voted out,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Year in, year out, we get poorer.\u0026nbspThey closed all the pits, closed the steelworks.\u0026nbspWhat are we left with?\u0026nbspA few food factories, and streets where shops are closing down left, right and centre.”“Where’s it all gone?” he asks, when you mention the EU money.\u0026nbsp“Regeneration projects?\u0026nbspWhere’s the regeneration? We’ve had 40-odd years of the EU.\u0026nbspI thought, f***\u0026nbspit, have a change.\u0026nbspIt can’t get any worse.”Mix in a few comments from others, about having to take rules from countries that have “forgotten who liberated them” during the war, and you have what could be portrayed as the vote of irrational rage, biting the EU hand trying to feed them.There’s just one big problem with such dismissiveness: even someone who played a big part in getting EU money to Blaenau Gwent sympathises with what Owen and others are saying.\u0026nbspIn the 1990s, Victoria Winckler was a leading member of the taskforce that secured €1.9bn\u0026nbsp(£1.6bn) of EU funding for west Wales and the valleys, granted for the years 2000-06 on the basis that this area was one of the most deprived in Europe.Now, as the director of the Bevan Foundation think tank, she has written that if the Welsh valleys were showered with cash, “it appears to have gone straight down the drain”.The woman who helped deliver the EU money says the Brexit-backers of Blaenau Gwent were not fools\u0026nbspthey were people who “voted for the better future that the EU had failed to deliver”.Confessing her own disillusion, Dr Winckler tells The Independent: “You can point to a number of shiny EU projects.\u0026nbsp You can say, ‘Oh look, you have got a dual carriageway, some nice sculptures in your town centre.’\u0026nbsp“But that has not made a material difference to people’s lives. They are still struggling to find work, struggling to make ends meet.”To call these people turkeys voting for Christmas, she says, is patronising: “It makes the assumption that EU funding is always good, and people who had it but still voted Leave must be stupid. It blames people who took a rational decision.”Winckler is backed by Professor Roger Awan-Scully of Cardiff University, who has extensively researched the Leave vote in the valleys.He thinks they took what, from their perspective, was a pretty rational decision: “People who felt they had nothing left to lose, rolled the die and tried change.”Or, as one senior Remain campaigner said in the bitter aftermath of defeat:\u0026nbspfor these people, fear of Brexit bringing economic disaster “wasn’t credible, because they felt their lives were already s***”.That, she says, just made it even more tempting to blame “that lot over there with their bent bananas”.“The EU,” says Winckler, “has been wrongly blamed for all the ills that have affected Blaenau Gwent and other areas like it. There was a failure of UK government policy, from all parties, a long-term restructuring of the UK economy in which, to generalise very crudely, the regions were left to wither and die, while London and the south prospered.\u0026nbspOn top of which came a thick layer of austerity”.But both Awan-Scully and Winckler are pretty scathing about the Remain campaign as fought in 2016.Perhaps, then, if a Final Say referendum ever materialises from the current chaos – and perhaps even if it doesn’t – some lessons should be learned from what are called, with maybe a whiff of condescension, “the left-behind communities”.At HQ level there might also have to be an understanding of what happened when, as one campaigner put it, “Remain was fought in the spirit of a gentleman’s cricket match against a bunch of lunatics on day release from a life sentence of being themselves.”But as well as pointing to micro-targeted social media ads\u0026nbspand broken Brexit campaign spending limits, Remainers might want to look at how to fight a better ‘ground war’ – one that doesn’t complacently dismiss Leave voters in places like Blaenau Gwent fools.It is true that in Blaenau Gwent you can, if you look hard enough, find Brexit voters expressing, if not full-on “bregret”, then at least ambivalence over how they were sold what Winckler calls the Leave campaign’s “very simple and attractive promises”.But it does seem that for every Andrew, you can find a Steven Roberts, 57, of the Cwmglo Jewellery and Fashion shop, cafe\u0026nbspand art gallery.“I voted Remain,” he says, “But if I had to choose now, I would probably vote Leave. Over the past 30 to 40 years, Blaenau Gwent and the south Wales valleys have been absolutely devastated – raped and left to rot.“The people here have been shafted for so long.\u0026nbspIf we leave, we can’t do any worse than we are doing at the moment. We are not turkeys. We are desperate people. Very desperate.”Everyone here knows about the EU funding. Everyone derides it. The ungrateful natives even have the temerity to mock the shiny new roads that were built for them.The Heads of the Valley dual carriageway, upgraded with £79m of EU money, is dismissed as “the Blaenau Gwent bypass, the fast road out to the Midlands”, useless for low-wage workers trying to get to work when bus services are “always being cut”.“They’ve showered us with cash and it’s gone on the wrong things,” says a woman at\u0026nbspthe food bank, in Beaufort, a village above Ebbw Vale.Created with Sketch.

Now with her chemotherapy finished, Sarah faces reconstructive surgery and a massive drop in her employment support allowance. Hence the food bank trip.“There’s nothing left for people in Ebbw Vale,” she says. “No future for my children, no secure jobs, just zero-hours contracts.\u0026nbspMy 19-year-old hasn’t had a full-time, settled job since he left school. He’s suffering with depression.”All the signs are that mental illness is on the rise in Blaenau Gwent, while average male wages have stagnated since the steelworks shut. By the time of the referendum, a man on median wages was £71 a week worse off in real terms than in the early 2000s.People with jobs sometimes have to resort to the food bank. Some families need charitable assistance before they can send their children to school in proper shoes and uniforms.And, according to Sarah, to a community at “rock bottom”, in urgent need of economic resuscitation, the EU money has bought “shiny ornaments in the town centre”.Everyone tells you about the shiny dragon in Ebbw Vale town centre. It is reached by walking up the main street, past signs of rampant fuel poverty blighting an area once famous for coal production: “Pay gas and electric here” says the note in the window of Cash \u0026amp Xchange.\u0026nbsp“Sell your stuff, buy it back later, for cash when you need it,” promises Cash Generator.And then, after just two vape shops, the dragon is there: rising 13ft\u0026nbsphigh on its hind legs, a glittering vision of resurgent power fired by the past glories referenced in the artwork’s title:\u0026nbspHeart of the Furnace.“Yet another positive example of how Welsh government and EU funds are benefiting the region,” was the verdict of Jane Hutt, the Welsh government finance minister who unveiled it in 2014.If you look at the background, you can see that the dragon is flanked on one side by a sign for BrightHouse\u0026nbspand on the other by a banner for Poundstretcher, neither suggestive of an economy roaring back to greatness.Of course, some of the results of local council, Welsh government and EU regeneration funding are, as Winckler and others point out, invisible to the naked eye.Considerable amounts of money have, for example, been spent on apprenticeships. In other words, you can choose how to interpret the banner outside the new Ebbw Vale Sports Centre, built on part of the old steelworks site.\u0026nbspThe banner advertises “Bridges Into Work 2”, free training for the over-25s and unemployed, thanks to money from the European Social Fund.Perhaps this shows the EU properly addressing Blaenau Gwent’s underlying problems. But it could also be read as a confession that a shiny new sports centre cannot replace the jobs lost when the steelworks shut – even if the new building gets listed on the internet as “a modern leisure hub with a pool and water slides”.There is a similar ambivalence about the £21m Ebbw Fawr Learning Community, the new “super-school” that also occupies part of the old steelworks site.In the Cwm Legion, Owen talks proudly of “going skint to put my daughter in university”. But then he adds: “I told her to get out of this area. I don’t want her struggling like I did. There is no future for kids here. They turn to drink or drugs.”He is not the only one asking what lies in store for their children once they leave their shiny new super-school. They all know this isn’t just the EU’s fault. Many are more angry at local politicians, for a perceived lack of strategic vision in spending the money, than they are about the EU that granted the funds.In the former constituency of Aneurin Bevan, the people of Blaenau Gwent dismiss nearly all modern politicians as hopelessly out of touch with the struggles of their community.“They might as well live on the moon as far as I am concerned,” says Sarah in the food bank.She talks of backing Brexit as “a rebellion. We had just had enough. The system had to change.”You do worry, though, about how, post-Brexit, “the system”\u0026nbspmight change for the even worse. How would money be found to help places like Blaenau Gwent if “rolling the die”\u0026nbspand voting Leave pushed the entire British economy into a no-deal, cliff-edge Brexit? Who in a post-Brexit UK would be strong enough to defend some of the values that are central to EU membership?\u0026nbspRather pointedly, Winckler stresses “the EU’s fairness role, which means one country can’t undercut another in terms of how it treats its workers”.The people of Blaenau Gwent are smart enough to see through the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, men not exactly known for their instinctive understanding of, or sympathy for, the struggling ex-miner or former steelworker.History valley- where the revival was bornNissan has been betrayed by Brexit ideologues like Jacob Rees-MoggBut, given the hand dealt them by many conventional politicians over many decades, you can’t be entirely surprised by the response when you ask about the risks of being delivered into the clutches of Brexiteers who arguably couldn’t care less about them.“Nobody else cares about us either,” says Roberts.If you are a Remainer hoping to win a second referendum, you might have to consider whether he has a point.If you are seeking “turkeys”, you might like to wonder whether, come Brexit, no Brexit or Theresa May compromise, a community that helped make Britain “great” deserves much better – from its own government as much as the EU – than more of the same\u0026nbspand a shiny dragon.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Like the review, we believe in strong local journalism and have been looking at how best to develop the work we have begun with the industry and will have more to say in the near future, a spokesperson said.However, there is no evidence of the BBC crowding out other providers. This was looked at extensively during Charter review. It\u0027s vital that people of all ages have access to impartial news which is relevant to them, and we provide younger audiences with a wide range of stories.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re happy to look at what more we can do to share our technical and digital expertise for the benefit of local publishers, but as the review itself says, any curtailing of the BBC\u0027s news offer would be counter-productive.Representing national, regional and local news organisations, the News Media Association (NMA) said it wanted to work with ministers to take forward the recommendations of the review as a matter of urgency.This is a thoughtful report which recognises the critical role of written journalism to democracy and sets out a series of detailed recommendations, many of which respond directly to the proposals put forward by the NMA and our members, it said in a statement.These include a Competition and Markets Authority market study into the \u0027complex and opaque\u0027 online advertising market, new measures aimed at constraining the behaviour of the online platforms, an examination of the BBC\u0027s impact on commercial publishers, funding support for local news publishers, and tax reliefs such as extending VAT zero rating for online news publications.We look forward to engaging with the government to discuss the Cairncross recommendations in more detail and how these should be taken forward as a matter of urgency to ensure they support independent journalism delivered by a strong and sustainable press.The Society of Editors (SoE) welcomed the review\u0027s support for the reporting of local democracy –\u0026nbspincluding the expansion of the BBC local news partnerships –\u0026nbspbut said it was essential the press remained free from political interference.It is extremely gratifying that Dame Frances and her panel have underscored the need to protect and indeed reinvigorate the reporting of local democracy and open justice, areas which have suffered and continue to suffer as the industry contracts, its executive director, Ian Murray, said.Crucial to all of the recommendations for what is really state support for the local media industry in particular, are the report\u0027s insistence that bodies such as the proposed institution are free from political and other interference in deciding what constitutes public interest news worth supporting.”Additional reporting from agencies\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

That could be bad news for users.Everything we know about Apple\u0027s next iPhoneIt means that Apple won\u0027t be shipping the more powerful plugs that it includes with its latest iPads, and which can be bought for extra money. Those bigger plugs charge the phones and other products more quickly, allowing people not to have to wait while they charge up.The latest iPhones have the ability to use fast charging, but they require a plug that allows them to work. The 5W charger bundled in the box does of course charge the phone, but at a much slower rate, and iPhone users have to pay up for the more powerful plug.The problem is becoming clearer as Apple\u0027s batteries get larger, as has happened in recent phones. Though that means that phones can hold much more charge, it also takes them much longer to fill up.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He\u0026nbspsought asylum when a warrant was issued for his arrest in Zimbabwe after he wrote blog posts hostile to the government.Zimbabwe officials interrogate asylum seekers in UK detention centresMr Mujakachi, 57, said\u0026nbspthat in his re-documentation interview in December,\u0026nbspembassy officials had asked for more information about him and his relatives in a bid to confirm his\u0026nbspidentity – which he found “highly suspicious”. He added that he “would not be spared” by the Zimbabwean authorities.Speaking from Vulcan House on Monday, he\u0026nbspsaid: “I’m shocked that they want to send me back to a place where all those terrible things are happening. I’ve been vocal about the atrocities through my Twitter feeds and on YouTube. I will definitely stand out.“I won’t be able to walk out of the airport terminal without being interrogated by the police. There will be brutal beatings.“There was recently a debate in the House of Commons condemning the brutality and heavy-handedness of the Zimbabwean army and the police. They’ve condemned it. Do they think a mere condemnation by words is going to stop what’s happening?“Every government has a right to control immigration within its borders, but with this government it’s ideologically driven. They look at soft targets, and I am a soft target.”Zimbabwe officials interrogate asylum seekers in UK detention centresHome Office admits just one person helped by Windrush hardship schemeHome Office should no longer have power to detain people, MPs sayMr Mujakachi’s son, Simba, who was also ordered to sign on with the Home Office on Monday, but was not detained like his father, said he believed that if his father was removed to Zimbabwe, he would be “killed straight away”.“I don’t know how they can pull a move like this, working with the Zimbabwean government. It doesn’t make sense with what’s going on in Zimbabwe. It’s cruelty,” he said.“I think he’s going to get killed straight away. They will take him from the airport straight away and we will never hear about him again. We know how this government runs. A lot of people have been taken recently and no one knows where they are.“I haven’t eaten since I went and my dad got taken. I’ve been struggling to eat. I’m worried about my dad. I’m worried about me. I don’t know why I was let out yesterday, but I’m sure that sooner or later they will take me.”Mr Mujakachi’s solicitor, Kathryn Hodder, who is seeking to submit an injunction to prevent his removal, said she believed the alleged agreement between\u0026nbspthe Home Office and Zimbabwean officials could be acting in breach of UK\u0026nbspimmigration rules, which prohibit “actors of persecution” being directly informed that an application for asylum has been made.She added: “Before, they couldn’t remove Zimbabweans because there was no agreement with the government. So no one from Zimbabwe could be removed unless they got a passport.Violence in Zimbabwe obscures the potential for a bright future“But it looks like this government wants aid from the UK, so it’s just part of politics – we’ll give you money if you take back your people.“Victor didn’t have a passport, and now he’s got travel documents from the Zimbabwean government. The embassy representative had a big file and said he knew everything about him. It’s not good if they government knows about him even before he’s removed.”Sheffield councillor Jackie Drayton, who accompanied Mr Mujakachi to sign on at Vulcan House, where he was detained, said it was “awful” that he was facing removal, saying: “He didn’t come prepared to not go home. It’s so sudden and shocking.“Victor is somebody who has been threatened by the government. And he’s very active about the things going on at the moment. Yes, Mugabe is not in power now, but there’s no doubt people in his government are still I power, and it’s not a safe place for people.”Marian Machekanyanga, another Zimbabwean national who was also forced to attend a re-documentation interview in December, and has been ordered to sign on next week,\u0026nbspsaid she was “terrified” that she would have the same fate as Mr Mujakachi.The 54-year-old, who has been in the UK for 16 years after fleeing political persecution for her opposition to the government, said: “I was in tears when I received the letter. I’m very scared. I know that they are going to take me. People are being killed by the regime. I’m even more scared than last time.”It was widely reported by the Zimbabwean media in February that the then British ambassador to Zimbabwe, Catriona Laing, had told Kembo Mohadi, Zimbabwe’s deputy president, that the UK intended to deport illegal Zimbabweans to the country.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 48Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Young members of Britain\u0027s opposition Labour party write on a billboard why they want Jeremy Corbyn the party leader to back a People\u0027s Vote second referendum on Britain\u0027s European Union membership, during a publicity stunt in Islington North, Corbyn\u0027s north London constituency.

The policy was scrapped by Michael Gove when he became Justice Secretary later that year77 Cyclists not road usersAs Transport Secretary, Grayling once failed to recognise cyclists as road usersBut Labour\u0027s shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said Mr Grayling was off the richter scale of incompetence and called on him to quit.The decision to award the contract to Seaborne was was further mocked\u0026nbsplast month when it emerged that the company appeared to have copied the terms and conditions on its website from a takeaway outlet.Meg Hiller, chair of the influential Commons Public Accounts Committee, said there were serious issues in the way DfT had handled the tender and vowed to press officials on the matter at a meeting on Wednesday.She said: “The Department for Transport waited until September 2018 to start thinking about the risks to freight transport across these important routes,” she said.“We will be pressing the department for answers on how it awarded its three new ferry contracts, what it is doing to manage risks and exactly what it intends to do now it has axed the contract with Seaborne.”On Tuesday a vessel owned by Dutch company Van Oord was still dredging Ramsgate port\u0026nbspto remove silt and make it deep enough for ferries to dock and turn, despite no freight contract being in place.Thanet District Council said it had not contracted anyone to dredge the port and county councillor Paul Messenger told The Independent\u0026nbspthat he and fellow councillors had been kept in the dark about where the money was coming from.Seaborne director Glenn Dudley said that his company had handled the dredging contract but did not state where funding had come from\u0026nbspand refused to answer further questions. It is unclear how Seaborne, a company with no assets and whose only known contract has now been cancelled could shoulder any dredging costs which local campaigners calculate to be at least £400,000 and which could spiral to several million.Mr\u0026nbspMessenger said there is a likelihood that costs will balloon and work could take several months if more comprehensive dredging is required, while North Thanet MP Sir Roger Gale has said he believes the operation could cost up to £4m.Despite pledging to not spend a penny of taxpayers\u0027 money on the Seaborne contract, Mr Grayling did not rule out a government takeover of Ramsgate port when questioned on Monday.Asked by Sir Roger Gale if there was anything preventing the DfT stepping in, the transport minister told the Commons he had been “very clear that we have to be mindful of the financial position of Thanet council and we must make sure that they are not exposed to the broader financial risk of the broader resilience work being done right across Kent”.According to the NAO, Mr Grayling’s department only realised in September that extra freight capacity would be needed to prevent significant no-deal Brexit disruption at crucial Channel ports supplying more than a fifth of the UK’s goods.The DfT decided not to go through the normal open tender process, believing that this could notify the market and push up prices for additional freight. Instead, nine ferry operators were contacted privately and asked to bid.Only three did so: DFDS, Britanny and Seaborne. All three were awarded contracts in December, with the public notices quietly published on Christmas Eve. Lack of interest meant the government received offers for less than half of the capacity it had hoped and could supply a maximum of 11 per cent of the freight currently going through the short Channel routes.The DfT went ahead with the deals despite finding that Seaborne was “non-compliant with the requirements set out in the invitation to tender”.“As a new business without significant financial history, Seaborne were unable to satisfactorily meet the requirements of the economic and financial standing assessment,” the NAO said.“The department, considering the information it held on the bidders and the due diligence it had undertaken, decided to award contracts to all three bidders.”Mr Grayling’s department ignored numerous warnings from highly paid consultants about the Seaborne contract, the NAO said. After spending £800,000 on consultancy fees the DfT assessed the contract as being a “high-risk proposition” late last year but went ahead with it in any case. Despite the alarm bells Mr Grayling insisted publicly in January that the contract was “not a risk”.In November, DfT advisor Deloitte said that it could not assess Seaborne’s financial stability because the company had only been registered in July 2017. Mr Grayling’s department last week earmarked a further £800,000 to pay legal fees relating to Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel which is suing the DfT for its “secretive and flawed procurement process”.The DfT\u0027s accounting officer reviewed the Seaborne decision, which found that failure to act would mean losing “the ability to secure ferry capacity that could protect critical goods under a no-deal exit” and that “reasonable measures” had been taken to ensure value for money. The Treasury then approved the deal. Among risks identified were “teething troubles” due to Seaborne’s inexperience, the fact that the company had no contracts to use either Ramsgate or Ostend ports and had no ships chartered. The DfT also raised concerns about the work needed to get Ramsgate ready for use and a recruitment process for Border Force officers. Former Thanet District Councillor Ian Driver told The Independent this week that the site remained “like a bombsite”.Mr Messenger of the county council said it was regrettable that Ramsgate and its 40,000 residents were being used as pawns in a battle between Leave and Remain factions.The councillor is backing alternative proposals to transform Ramsgate into a marina focused on leisure and tourism rather than freight. The proposals are commercially viable, unlike the freight option, and will mean less pollution and disruption for local residents, Mr Messenger said.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Brussels\u0026nbsphas insisted that\u0026nbspit will not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspmeaning no changes to the controversial Irish\u0026nbspbackstop.On Tuesday, Ms May will have to ask MPs for more time to secure the changes she is seeking.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe\u0026nbspfurther delay has renewed speculation that this is a deliberate ploy, with Labour accusing the prime minister of “cynically” running down the clock.Some opponents claim that her strategy is to waste time and then\u0026nbspforce MPs to vote on her deal when it is too late to find any alternative.Move your Brexit red lines, Labour and EU both tell Theresa MayIn theory she could return to the Commons late in March –\u0026nbspjust days before the 29 March exit date –\u0026nbspand claim parliament has only two choices: back her deal\u0026nbspor leave the EU without an agreement.\u0026nbspMs May\u0026nbsphas already pushed back key votes on her Brexit deal, fuelling claims\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspshe is playing for time.First she delayed the “meaningful vote” on her\u0026nbspwithdrawal agreement\u0026nbspby more than\u0026nbspa month. Originally due to take place on 11 December, it was eventually held on 15 January.When the deal was rejected by an unprecedented\u0026nbsp230 votes, many people expected the prime minister to change strategy and pivot towards a softer Brexit, a no-deal outcome or some form of public vote.That has not happened. Instead, she\u0026nbsphas insisted she can secure the concessions from the EU that she believes she needs\u0026nbspto win parliament’s support for her deal, despite Brussels giving no indication\u0026nbspthat it is willing to budge.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentMore delays seem to be on the horizon. Last month, Ms May promised that she would either give MPs a vote on a revised deal\u0026nbspby 13 February or, if she had not been able to secure further changes, on an amendable motion updating the Commons on her negotiations.With no alternative deal\u0026nbspin sight, MPs will only\u0026nbspvote this week on the government’s update,\u0026nbspwhich is likely to say that more time is needed\u0026nbspto secure changes to the agreement.Ministers have floated\u0026nbspthe prospect of a similar vote being held on 27\u0026nbspFebruary, meaning a second vote on the deal itself\u0026nbspis unlikely to happen before the end of February at the earliest. Even if a deal is then approved, it would leave just a month for parliament to pass all the legislation needed to enact Brexit.Video shows Jeremy Corbyn vowing to ‘defeat’ the EUFood industry threatens to end cooperation over no-deal riskCorbyn ‘cut second referendum line from letter to May’‘Take a breath’ and admit UK not ready for Brexit, Tory MPs tell MayAn EU summit scheduled for 22 March –\u0026nbspless than a week before Brexit day –\u0026nbspcould give Ms May justification for further delays, if she argues that this is when the EU will finally offer new concessions.\u0026nbspEven if no concessions were forthcoming, some people\u0026nbspbelieve that, faced with the threat of a no-deal Brexit in a matter of days, MPs would reluctantly\u0026nbspagree to support the prime minister’s plan (even if it is fundamentally unchanged from the one rejected in January).\u0026nbspBut any strategy involving running down the clock is highly risky, not least because it\u0026nbsprelies on parliament agreeing not to intervene in the coming weeks. Last month, Labour’s Yvette Cooper tabled an amendment that would have delayed Brexit until the end of the year if no deal was in place by the end of February.That motion was rejected by a margin of 23 votes, but as Brexit edges closer and the prospect of no deal becomes ever more likely, MPs might be swayed into backing another, similar\u0026nbspamendment.\u0026nbspThe Labour leadership is also seeking to torpedo Ms May’s ability to waste time. Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister offering talks on a cross-party compromise deal, and will this week table an amendment that would force her to hold a second vote on her Brexit deal –\u0026nbsprevised or not –\u0026nbspby 26 February.No one other than Ms May and her closest advisers knows whether\u0026nbspshe is deliberately running down the clock.\u0026nbspBut the continual delays and her refusal to consider an extension to Article 50 do little to quash claims that this is her plan.Even if it is\u0026nbspnot, the fact remains that the 29 March Brexit date is enshrined in law and the UK is speeding towards it without a deal in sight. Whether or not it is deliberately\u0026nbspbeing run down,\u0026nbspthe clock is\u0026nbspticking ever louder.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

There was Jenny, unpacking boxes with her family and in classic, comedy double-take action I walked by her room, stopped, and walked right back to it. Through three states, long-distance dating, high times, low moments and 19 years later, we now share a home, a little girl and a life, said Chad.

Asha said: It was the summer of 1971 when I met him for the first time. It was our engagement day which was just six days before our marriage. We didn\u0027t talk to each other until we got married. I was a free girl and used to go to jam sessions and enjoy time with friends. My life became completely different after I married him. He comes from a religiously conservative family. From a family of four, I had to live in a joint family of 20. I heard from my parents that he was also a religious person. I got to know about his devotional side when he went to a temple at 5 AM after spending our first night together. When I woke up I was alone. I sacrificed a lot after our marriage to adjust to a new environment. We are from a generation where we had to make a lot of compromises to make the marriage work, unlike today.

After that young man left the scene, Israel asked me to date him and I refused, I was willing to be a friend of him but I didn\u0027t want anything romantic.

Since that day on, I called her every day. In the beginning, she did not seem to be interested in me, but I conveyed my passion to her. On our first date, I waited at a meeting place for an hour. It turned out she had been advised by her mother and older sister to be late for an hour to see whether I was serious about her. My feelings got through to her, and we married on October 15, 1964, five days after the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics.

On September 14, 2017, after an eye surgery, I was flying with Saroj and suddenly started seeing things clearly. That was the first time I saw Saroj\u0027s face.

Both of us are dentists and married for eight years now. Before that, we met at our dental school on June 1, 2004, on the first day of the class. We both were invited to give a short speech before our classmates and teachers. I went first, and later him.

I didn\u0027t give him much attention, because, at the time, I was with another person, said Yohanna. He didn\u0027t stop looking at her and tried some pick up lines. When I saw him, he impressed me because he has very big eyes and the colour was very impressive but nothing else. I left early. One day he texted and asked her what she was doing and if he could go and visit. He bought me a bottle of anise liquor, but I told him, \u0027honey, I don\u0027t drink, you can buy me a chocolate if you want.\u0027 Huang Fusheng (R), 83, and his wife Tang Lanfang, 80, pose with their wedding photo taken in 1958, at Prince Fu Mansion built during Qing dynasty, where they worked together from 1965 to 1992, in central Beijing, China, February 7, 2018. Introduced to one another by their supervisor in 1956, the couple worked together at the mansion, which housed an office under the China National Publications Import and Export Corporation, for 27 years.

That night was the first time we really made eye contact with each other, the first time I talked to him. I remember I took off my shoes to dance on the table. At the end I only found one, Ismail found the other. He brought it to me two days later, like Cinderella.Oladipupo Baruwa, 45, an investment promotion officer and Funke Baruwa, 43, a gender and development expert, pose for a photograph at home in Abuja, Nigeria, February 9, 2018.

I just loved his persistence and the fact that he didn\u0027t want to give up, said Funke. After the birth of their first daughter in 2013 the pair made a commitment that, whatever lay ahead, they would face it together. For me that has always been the unifyingÂ¿Ã¤ factor... Marriage is a commitment, it is a hard work and when you are willing to work at it, you get better,Â¿Ã¤Baruwa said.

He bought me a bottle of anise liquor, but I told him, \u0027honey, I don\u0027t drink, you can buy me a chocolate if you want.\u0027 Huang Fusheng (R), 83, and his wife Tang Lanfang, 80, pose with their wedding photo taken in 1958, at Prince Fu Mansion built during Qing dynasty, where they worked together from 1965 to 1992, in central Beijing, China, February 7, 2018. Introduced to one another by their supervisor in 1956, the couple worked together at the mansion, which housed an office under the China National Publications Import and Export Corporation, for 27 years. I think our marriage is still fresh because we believed in forgiving and understanding each other, said Lanfang. Cathal King, 31, a veterinarian, and Jessica O\u0027Connor, 28, a final-year veterinary student in Budapest, pose for a photograph with dogs on Rossbeigh Beach near the County Kerry village of Rossbeigh, Ireland, February 4, 2018. We met playing tag rugby in Killarney. We\u0027re both very active people. We do adventure races, hiking, and love to travel. We\u0027ve been together three and a half years. I grew up back here in Rossbeigh so that\u0027s the main reason we\u0027re here, said Cathal. Dogs are Indi, the Spaniel, which they own together and Pippa, the Jack Russell, Jessica\u0027s mother\u0027s dog. Huang Chenfeng (R), 63, and her husband Zheng Dingguo, 63, pose for a picture at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center in Shanghai, China, February 6, 2018. Both originally come from Wenzhou in Zhejiang province. Huang has been taking care of her husband around the clock since he was admitted to the hospital for cancer treatment. The couple had an arranged marriage, organised by their parents in 1972. Noor Djait, 31, an architect and Ismail Benmiled, 36, a businessman pose for a photograph with their three-year-old son Said and four-month-old daughter Malek at their house in Tunis, Tunisia, February 9, 2018. Noor and Ismail lived on the same road and went to the same schools growing up, but never became close until they met in a nightclub when she was 17. That night was the first time we really made eye contact with each other, the first time I talked to him. I remember I took off my shoes to dance on the table. At the end I only found one, Ismail found the other. He brought it to me two days later, like Cinderella.Oladipupo Baruwa, 45, an investment promotion officer and Funke Baruwa, 43, a gender and development expert, pose for a photograph at home in Abuja, Nigeria, February 9, 2018. Well, he is persistent. We met at a church on the first Sunday service of the year 2000 and he followed me home after every service from that day on until about two years later. I just loved his persistence and the fact that he didn\u0027t want to give up, said Funke. After the birth of their first daughter in 2013 the pair made a commitment that, whatever lay ahead, they would face it together. For me that has always been the unifyingÂ¿Ã¤ factor... Marriage is a commitment, it is a hard work and when you are willing to work at it, you get better,Â¿Ã¤Baruwa said. Tony Wakaiga, 18, an art and design student and Suzzy Konje, 18, a hospitality management student pose for a photograph after their date as they walk along Banda Street in Nairobi, Kenya, February 11, 2018. Tony met Suzzy at a modelling photo session on Banda Street and they soon started dating. We have been very good friends for a long time and our passion for each other has matured like wine. This Valentine\u0027s Day, I have a special surprise for Suzzy that will knock her heart out, said Tony.Yolanda Zuniga, 66, and her husband Antonio Carrillo, 65, pose for a photograph in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, February 11, 2018. He has been my sweetheart since I was 14 years old. We lived in the same neighbourhood. I always loved his sense of humour and we got married when I was 19. My parents wouldn\u0027t let me go out dancing. Dancing has become our hobby. We go dancing on Saturdays and Sundays in downtown Ciudad Juarez, dressed as Pachucos. We have five children, 13 grandchildren and six great grandchildren, said Yolanda.A survey of women in Japan found more than 60 per cent\u0026nbspwill instead buy chocolates for themselves\u0026nbspon Valentine’s Day this year, while only\u0026nbsp35 per cent of women said they planned to offer chocolate to their male colleagues.More than 56 per cent said they would give chocolates to family members, while 36 per cent would make the same gesture towards partners or someone they fancy.Japanese magazine apologises for university ‘easy sex listing’Belgian chocolatier Goa ran a full page advert in a Japanese newspaper ahead of Valentine’s Day last year, urging businesses to tell women not to hand out chocolates to men at work if they felt pressured to.\u0026nbspIt said: “Valentine’s Day is supposed to be a day when you tell someone your pure feelings. It’s not a day on which you’re supposed to do something extra for the sake of smooth relations at work.“So men, especially if you’re the top person in your company, tell the women in your office ‘don’t force yourself to give anyone giri choco’.”Japan has recently been in the public eye for failing to recognise gender equality in the wake of the global #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault.The East Asian country ranks bottom of the G7 countries on female representation in politics and business.A number of medical universities in Japan last year admitted to meddling with entrance exam scores to deliberately put female applicants at a disadvantage.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

It would last for decades\u0026nbspbecause it was native, “organic”, and had already survived several shock tests.\u0026nbspMr Surkov, responsible for the Kremlin’s domestic strategy during the 2000s,\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspcredited with creating much of Russia’s postmodern,\u0026nbspauthoritarian model of government.\u0026nbspHe called the system “managed democracy” – a term that critics suggested was only ever half true.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Anti-Putin protests: hundreds of demonstrators arrested in Russia Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Russian police officers detain a protester in MoscowPro-Kremlin activists and opposition supporters scuffle in MoscowAlexei Navalny during the rallyRussian police arrest a participant of a liberal opposition rallyAlexei Navalny being carried away by policeDemonstrator carries a poster depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin during a massive protest rally in St.PetersburgRussian police detain a protester at a demonstration A fighter of National Liberation Movement, left, clashes with protesters Russian police arrest a participant of a liberal opposition rally Russian police detain a protester in Pushkin Square in MoscowProtesters attend a rally in St. PetersburgRussian police officers detain a protester in MoscowPro-Kremlin activists and opposition supporters scuffle in MoscowAlexei Navalny during the rallyRussian police arrest a participant of a liberal opposition rallyAlexei Navalny being carried away by policeDemonstrator carries a poster depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin during a massive protest rally in St.PetersburgRussian police detain a protester at a demonstration A fighter of National Liberation Movement, left, clashes with protesters Russian police arrest a participant of a liberal opposition rally Russian police detain a protester in Pushkin Square in MoscowProtesters attend a rally in St. PetersburgIn his long and often rambling article, the aide stayed close to his historical form. Russia was strong, he argued, only because it had rejected western notions and democratic institutions. Such institutions\u0026nbsponly\u0026nbspgave\u0026nbspan “illusion of choice”, and were inferior to Russia’s wise\u0026nbspleader, who was\u0026nbspable to “listen, understand and see” his\u0026nbsppeople.“The modern model of Russian statehood begins on trust and rests on trust,” he said. “This is its major distinction to the western model, which cultivates distrust and criticism. And herein lies its\u0026nbspstrength.” \u0026nbspWriting on Facebook, the political commentator Abbas Gallyamov\u0026nbspnoted wryly that Mr Surkov’s idea of trust appeared at\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsptime of\u0026nbsppolls registering historically low levels of trust in\u0026nbspthe leadership.Putin heralds successful tests of new hypersonic nuclear weaponsStep up Vladimir Putin, president of Belarus? Putin: Russia will develop intermediate-range missiles if US doesMr Surkov spared little praise of his boss.\u0026nbspIn time, Putin’s Russia would be recognised Russia’s fourth great “model of state-building”, he said – and on a par with the efforts of Ivan the Great in the 15th century, Peter the Great in the 18th century, and Vladimir Lenin in the 20th century.\u0026nbspPutin’s system was also ripe for export, Mr Surkov\u0026nbspadded. Foreign governments were already paying close attention, since the\u0026nbspRussian “political algorithm” had long predicted\u0026nbspthe volatility now seen in western democracies.\u0026nbsp“Russia is playing with the West’s minds,” he writes. “They don’t know how to deal with their own changed consciousness.” \u0026nbspDuring his peak in the 2000s,\u0026nbspMr Surkov cultivated an image of being an all-powerful operator, expertly recruiting and co-opting all strands of ideology political opinion. But his ambitions always went further than being an operator. He saw himself as the beating intellectual heart of the regime.\u0026nbspMr Surkov, while still an influential player, is no longer at the heart of the Kremlin policy machine.\u0026nbspHe fell out of favour with Vladimir Putin\u0026nbspafter appearing to side with Dmitry Medvedev in the tempestuous protest years of 2008-2012, and\u0026nbspwas unceremoniously dropped in favour of rival Vyacheslav Volodin.\u0026nbspSince then, Mr Surkov is believed to have taken charge of the Kremlin’s secret campaign in eastern Ukraine, has acted as Russia’s point of contact in the Minsk peace negotiations, and\u0026nbsphas taken to penning lofty\u0026nbspessays about the state of Russia.\u0026nbspPresidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said\u0026nbspMr Surkov’s “complex”, “interesting” and “deep” article had been neither approved or seen\u0026nbspby the president. That said,\u0026nbspthose inside the corridors of power shared “many” of the\u0026nbspopinions.\u0026nbsp“Surkov has experience in domestic politics, in party politics and in state-building that\u0026nbspis hard to overestimate,” the spokesperson said.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The first part calls for being yourself, and the second part calls for people to give each other pleasure.“This is the most positive quote that is the best to reflect the image of a modern woman, who not only spits on stereotypes but also a woman who goes into the world with a positive agenda.”He said the campaign was “a huge success”,\u0026nbspadding that “nobody ever spoke that much of Reebok in Russia, in the world it hasn’t happened since the 90s”.Reebok, an English sportswear brand founded in Bolton in the late 1950s, recently launched a global advertising campaign which sought to promote female empowerment under the hashtag #BeMoreHuman. It featured high-profile iniduals\u0026nbspsuch as model Gigi Hadid and actor Gal Gadot who encouraged other women to be strong and assertive.The Russian version was launched on Thursday with a hashtag that roughly translated as #OutOfControl and native Russian models. They included mixed martial artist\u0026nbspJustyna Graczyk and\u0026nbspAnzhelika Pilyaeva, a champion jiu jitsu fighter, according to the\u0026nbspNew York Post.Ms Marshenkulova was pictured in one of the Russian campaign images\u0026nbspalongside the now-withdrawn slogan that she had authored.After some social media users voiced outrage, Ms Marshenkulova,\u0026nbspwho is the founder of the Women’s Power feminist Telegram channel, poked fun at them on Facebook.“God, save Russia from me and from cunnilingus,” she said.Gigi Hadid designs bold trainers for new Reebok collection“We live in a world where advertising is a zone of chauvinism and in every second woman is used as bait,” she added.Before the backlash began, Ms Marshenkulova told her Telegram followers she thought Reebok was joking and would never accept her slogan.“And here we are launching an advertisement, where one of the slogans (no kidding) is my famous ‘Stop sitting on the needle of male approval, start sitting on men’s faces’!” she said.“Because it’s time to stop worrying about what others think of you, stop being afraid of being NOT THE GOOD KIND of woman, stop adjusting your life and your looks to what your partner or neighbour said”.A spokesperson for Reebok said they ensured their messages meet certain standards but unfortunately a local execution of this campaign in Russia did not meet these standards.They said Mr Golofast was no longer a Reebok employee, adding that his comments do not reflect the views and opinions of the company.This execution of our ‘Be More Human’ campaign, which was pulled as soon as we were made aware of it, was not authorized by Reebok. The overall campaign, however, will continue as planned, the spokesperson added.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Heres the latest on how its affecting your cash.On February  the pound is trading at . against the euro.It closed yesterday at ..The British currency rose off three-week lows against the dollar on Tuesday as Prime Minister Theresa May said the government would seek to speed up ratication of its Brexit withdrawal deal with the European Uniontime gets too tight.Lee Hardman, currencies analyst at MUFG said: The recent bigger picture is still that market participants are actively pursuing downside protection.He said that sterling markets remained relatively calm, with the spot price reflecting more confidence that Britain would avoid a chaotic exit from the EU. But as the clock ticks down, that optimism is likely to fade, Hardman noted.Before the EU referendum in June  a pound was trading for around €.. Sterling fell around  per cent after the result.The highest rate in recent years was €. in November .Foreign exchangemarkets allow currencies to be bought and sold around the world.They are necessary for international commerce but are also opportunities for traders to make a profit by effectively gambling on whether rates go up or down.As in any market, rates are determined by the price that buyers and sellers are willing to accept.If more people are buying than selling the price will go up, and vice versa.Traders confidence in a countrys economic health is the biggest factor shaping forex markets.Reports and forecasts on GDP growth, inflation, employment, retail sales and manufacturing can prompt traders to buy or sell a countrys currency.Other factors that sway forex markets include interest rate decisions by central banks , and news such as the signing of a trade deal or a natural disaster.Movements in global capital markets, bond markets and stock markets can also influence forex trading.Banks and money changers who sell holiday cash broadly follow foreign exchange markets in the rates they offer the public.The buy and sell price for each currency is usually a few percentage points either side of the true rate so they can make a profit eventhere is no commission.Unstable and unpredictable government events can also negatively impact the pounds strength in trading.Following the resignations of Theresa Mays Cabinet in response to her draft Brexit proposal on Thursday, the pound plummeted to its lowest value in over a year.Euros can be bought at supermarkets, such as Marks  Spencer, as well as the Post Office and currency specialists – but rates y massively.The best rates can often be found at specialist online outlets, such as Travelex, which will deliver cash directly to your home.Travellers can use comparison sites, like MoneySavingExperts TravelMoneyMax, to find the best rate.If you order in advance and pick up the cash then you’ll most likely get a better rate thanyou walk into a bureau de change.Alternatively, providers such as FairFX and WeSwap offer currency cards that can load up at a good rate and then use abroad like a debit card without transaction fees on each purchase.You can always buy last-minute currency at the airport or withdraw cash at your destination, but its almost always cheaper to buy before you go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So you go out with your dog, he catches the food for you.Whilst Nathan still lives at home with his mum and dad, he claims that his £-a-month benefits cheque isnt enough to feed himself.“Everything’s going up in price...I remember when you could get eight cans of beans for a quid, now you can only get two,” he said.He claims to be looking for work, but remarks that benefits dont compare to the money he used to net from drug dealing.I’d rather go back to selling drugs, swear down I had money every day, he said.Nathan claims hes actively looking for work.I told the job centre what I was good at, they sat me down and asked meI wanted to be an IT technician, he explains.How can I do that when I can’t read or write Mum Tracey adds that her son struggled with school, and ended up being kicked out.He took the only path he knew, which was getting into trouble, she adds.Skint Britain: Friends Without Benefits is on Channel ,  February, at pmOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There’s so much he’s got to give! He’s completely positive!In footage from , the then anonymous backbench MP from the People’s Republic of Islington ­lambasts “the European empire” and mocks Brussels for wanting referendums re-run until they produce the “correct” result.Oh, Jeremy Corbyn!I bet all the middle-class kiddies who worshipped at your sandals-and-socks combo at Glastonbury never saw this coming.The footage of Corbyn dissing Brussels to an Irish audience is so incendiary it makes Liam Neeson look as though he chooses his words carefully.Comrade Corbyn really, really could not be clearer about his true feelings.“We are creating here one massive great Frankenstein which will damage all of us in the long run,” he says of the EU.“If you succeed in getting a No vote herethat will be such a boost to people like us, all over Europe, who do not want to live in a European empire of the st century.”You tell ’em, Boris! I mean, Jeremy!After being forced out of the Brexit closet, JC can no longer cynically have it both ways — playing a Remainer to the middle class and a Leaver to the working class. That hypocritical ploy to squeeze into  Downing Street will no longer fly.It is a dead ploy. That ploy is extinct. It is no more.On the great issue of our time, the old boy just got shoved right off the fence. And fell on his face.Donald Tusk, Brussels’ head bully boy, digressed from condemning .million Brits to hell for voting Leave to sneer that there is a “leadership void” in the Remain camp. He means YOU, Jeremy.Tusk has seen right through two-faced Corbyn, evenall the little Marxist morons who chant his name are only just waking up to the cruel truth. Corbyn deserves to be despised by both sides of the debate.He placed the prospect of power above his principles. And we still don’t really know how he voted in the Referendum — although we can make an educated guess.The irony is that Jeremy Corbyn could have been a true hero to the working-class men and women who have voted Labour for a letime and then voted in their millions to leave the EU.Corbyn could have spoken for those men and women and stood up for them when the sneering elite dismissed them as thick, racist bigots too stupid to have a valid opinion.It was Tony Benn, Corbyn’s great hero, and the most eloquent opponent of the European Union in our nation’s history, who famously said he felt like “a slave to Rome” when he went to Brussels.Tony Benn would have had the courage to advocate Brexit and ­Corbyn must know it.Jeremy will be a tiny footnote in our nation’s history but what a crying shame that, in our country’s time of need, the Labour Party could not produce a leader who would represent the millions of working-class men and women who have learned to despise the EU.Corbyn tried to play it smart — and still does — by endlessly parroting that “everything is on the table” and never truly engaging with the debate that has come close to tearing this country apart.And now he has been caught out because Corbyn, always more Mickey Mouse than Machiavelli, was never clever enough to play this duplicitous game.The EU is revealing its true nature — a bullying empire that has no interest in being a partner, friend or ally of the Britishwe eventually manage to leave.The EU wants to see us on our knees.The EU wants to see us suffer for refusing to be their obedient colony.The EU wants us to pay such a high price for leaving that the remaining countries will be too timid to dream of le beyond this democracy-despising empire.All we can do is oppose these arrogant, unelected bullies. All we can do is demand our independence — no matter the dark warnings, no matter the sneering, no matter the threat of punishment beatings.What a tragedy for Labour that their leader never had the guts to join this nation’s fight for independence.ELLE MACPHERSON has revealed her simple guide for looking drop dead gorgeous.Most of Elle’s tips are eminently doable for any of us – eat your evening meal early , get fresh air every day, have some calming tea before bedtime and,sleep doesn’t come, put your feet up for five minutes.Only one of The Body’s tips is more dficult to arrange – Elle suggests regular relaxation in a sauna or steam room – but most of her guidelines for healthy radiance are simple common sense.But she has missed the most important tip of all.Be born beautul.Don’t forget that one, Elle!THE Tories are very keen on “autonomous” vehicles – driverless cars with no steering wheels and “no human oversight” – and hope that they will be zipping about on our roads within two years.Automotive minister Richard Harrington says: “We need to ensure we take the public with us as we move towards having self-driving cars on our roads by .”But I remember when a Labour government swore to us that diesel cars were the bright, shining future.In , Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced tax changes to petrol-fuelled cars that led to a massive increase in idiots like me buying diesel cars.The thinking was that diesel would help the environment because diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide than petrol engines.Unfortunately, diesel also produces far more pollutants and poisons, resulting in around , deaths every year.Whoops.I now have an elderly diesel car sitting on the drive that everyone hates.My excuse is that Gordon Brown told me I was saving the planet.Nobody wants diesel today. That is why Japanese car- maker Nissan will not be building its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. Brexit doesn’t come into it.These days driving a diesel is considered to be slightly less healthy than smoking crack. And the Tory “dash to driverless” is as muddle-headed as the Labour “dash to diesel” when Gordon Brown was in his pomp.Driverless cars – what could possibly go wrong WHEN Prince Charles met the Spice Girls in , the Prince of Wales clearly towered above the then Geri Halliwell.Reunited this week, they now appear to be the same height.Has the former Ginger Spice grown over the last  years Or is our future king shrinking  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it strikes a powerful chord with real people, particularly voters in the North.They resent claims they are racist thickos and believe all parties lied to them in  when they promised to deliver on the referendum, whatever the outcome.Like the BBC — and, indeed, the EU itself — Remainers are slow to realise time is running out. Brexit is to the EU what Netflix is to the BBC. The £billion licence fee — like the European “Grand Project” — is on its way out.Whatever last-minute deal Theresa May brings home, the scepticism which brought Brexit to le cannot simply be turned off.It is a disruptive force and is already beginning to sweep away the EU as we know it.Economist Bernard Connolly famously identied this as the logical consequence of EU skulduggery in his book The Rotten Heart Of Europe: The Dirty War For Europe’s Money.Connolly was in charge of setting up the euro, the slow-burning catastrophe which has wrecked economies and young lives across the EU.He was sacked for exposing the secretive abuse of power at the very top, exposing the unscrupulous methods deployed by an unaccountable regime to bludgeon critics into submission.The same tactics are used on rebellious nations like Britain today and Greece in , triggering the explosion of anger we are seeing among protesting citizens and a rise of authoritarianism against such dissent.EU states are at each other’s throats — Italy against France, Brussels against Hungary and Poland.The rise of military-style policing — French police firing hard rubber bullets at unarmed yellow-jacket protestors, the jailing of dissident politicians in Catalonia — is alarming.Romania, a former Soviet police state, is reverting to type and spying on its own citizens.Hungary locks up opponents and silences the media.The EU does nothing, fearing for its own survival.Europe-wide polls reveal increasing antagonism to Brussels, deeper even than here in the UK.He remains a cherished champion of free speech and razor-sharp inquisitorial combat.Mean-spirited as ever, the left-wingcould not resist suggesting he was past his sell-by date.Not by such a margin as this preachy, unpopular rag which is about to go out of print.Those politicians who believe we mustto the EU’s totalitarian embrace are grievously out of step.Yes, Brexit has been botched, both by Theresa May and by Brexiteers themselves. There may be trouble ahead.But those who voted in their millions in  to leave have not budged.

They walked in to find a naked woman on the bed.One of the visitors recalled: “There on the mattress on the floor in the one room is Diane with the duvet up to her neck, saying, ‘What the ****’s going on ’ We were quite shaken.” As Abbott tried to protect her modesty, Corbyn announced she was his new girlfriend.The source continued: “It was the late Seventies, it was still a point of interest, a white man with a black woman, so he was slightly showing off – ‘I’ve got a new girlfriend, and she’s black’.”At the time Abbott was working at the National Council for Civil Liberties.When colleagues went through her desk they found an eyebrow-raising sexual fantasy scrawled in her diary. In it she described being man- handled by her lover Corbyn – “a bearded Fenian and NUPE national organiser”.The loved-up pair went on a motorbike tour of East Germany, while Abbott has described her “finest half-hour” as romping in a Cotswold field with a mystery man, believed to be Corbyn.Author Bower claims the relationship broke down because Abbott wanted children but he did not.On one occasion, according to the new book, the family was invited to spend a week at a friend’s country home in Derbyshire, but Corbyn failed to show.For  hours, Claudia called around trying to track him down.He eventually arrived two days later, vaguely explaining his absence as a necessary sacrice for “the movement”.Even when Claudia was in hospital about to give birth to their first child in , Corbyn was more concerned with local leafletting.He was running for re-election at the time, and phoned constituency agent Keith Veness from outside the delivery room with an important update.Corbyn announced: “I’m really worried — we haven’t put out that leaflet about Northern Ireland.”His friend replied: “Haven’t you got something more serious to worry about ”Corbyn had met Claudia in  — seven years after his orce from first we Jane Chapman — at a protest meeting against Chile’s military dictatorship.Claudia was already married but, by the following year, she was pregnant with Corbyn’s child and rushed through a orce to marry her new admirer.They went on to have three boys — Sebastian, Benjamin and Thomas — before calling time on their relationship in .Corbyn managed to give the split a political spin, declaring the break was down to Claudia refusing to send their son to a failing comprehensive and he “felt strongly about comprehensive education”.But fellow Labour firebrand Ken Livingstone claims the marriage ended “long before the school bit”.She recalled: “Jeremy professed love early on and said that I was ‘the best of the best’, so I thought this must be the thing.”But the -year-old bride quickly discovered that “her husband was not interested in equality within marriage, or in sharing any domestic chores”.Despite the two of them both being councillors, she found herself doing the housework and being stuck alone in their small flat night after night.When Corbyn did arrive in time for dinner, he would often open a tin of beans, usually Tesco’s own brand, and eat them cold.On livelier evenings, he would sit on the floor drunkenly singing IRA songs. Jane’s requests to go out were ignored.Meanwhile, she was shocked that the opinionated “thinker” did not read a single book during their years together.Author Tom Bower writes: “Her initial judgment that he was ‘bright’ was mistaken.”Holidays were also grim — with his idea of a summer getaway being a tour with his we of an impoverished Eastern bloc country, sleeping in tents. The marriage ended in , with Corbyn patronisingly putting the split down to a “feminist kick”.Chapman, now a university professor and filmmaker, said: “He didn’t acknowledge my emotional side. He doesn’t recognise a woman’s feelings.”She added: “His lack of emotional awareness didn’t change.”And, in his new book, author Tom Bower claims it was a result of Corbyn’s poor financial management. Corbyn was funding his party office in Holloway, North London, out of his own pocket and was seriously in debt.Claudia and their three young sons were left with so little money for food and clothes that she once pleaded: “We can’t afford a decent le.”Eventually, after the couple split, the family home in Islington, North London, was sold for £,to pay off the debts.Claudia and the boys moved into the top floors of a smaller home, with Corbyn in the basement. There he had a series of flings with younger women, according to Bower’s book, out on February .His success with the opposite sex confused many, with one old friend telling him: “You couldn’t pull all these womenyou weren’t an MP. They wouldn’t be interested in an old man with a beard.”The hard-Left MP for North Islington was far more understanding when it came to Soviet communist leaders oppressing others.His old friend Keith Veness said Corbyn believed Soviet leaders had rightly put down a revolt in Hungary in  and the pro-democracy Prague Spring in .And when Veness mentioned Joseph Stalin’s brutality against his own people, he says: “Jeremy walked away. He couldn’t do political arguments.”In the extract from his book in yesterday’s Mail on Sunday, author Bower also portrays Corbyn’s party as an anarchic mess where neither the leader nor many of his overpaid team turn up for meetings on time.He writes: “Meetings arranged to start at am were delayed because no one arrived until , and some staff did not come to work at all.” An insider told the author: “They were lazy and p***ed on £, a year.”Meanwhile, in the same year as his orce, Corbyn met Mexican ex-human rights lawyer Laura Alez,  years his junior.They conducted a long-distance relationship before she moved to the UK in , and they wed the following year.Laura has rarely spoken about their relationship — but, in , gave a telling insight into marriage with the proud leftie: “He’s not very good at housework.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their foolishness means Britain must give away a fixed . per cent of national income at a time when global poverty is plummeting due to capitalism, scientic progress and technological advances.Now some Tories are trying to find ways to keep their promise to hit this aid target, while spending the money in fresh ways. That exposes the ­shallowness of ministers’ ­posturing as heroic saviours of the poor and dispossessed.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told the Cabinet last month this level of aid spending was “unsustainable” and money should be shted to domestic priorities.She has floated the idea of ­building new ships for the Royal Navy from the aid ­budget by using them for humanitarian operations.And she knows the issue will rear up in any forthcoming Tory leadership battle.Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson chipped in, saying Britain needs more control over what counts as foreign aid under international rules — and that it should go towards boosting British foreign policy objectives.His move was linked to a report by former soldier turned Tory MP Bob Seely arguing that Britain should simply define its own aid spending to include our ­“strategic goals”.Yet they all miss the obvious solution. Just DITCH the target and abandon the  law binding us to it — one that makes the Department for International Developmentthe only ministry that must explain itself to MPsit fails to spend enough.This silly UN target is an historic anachronism devised by campaigners half a century ago based on flawed, outdated economic data.It makes no sense to rely on a fixed spending target based on national income over needs in poor places — as predicted by a former Tory Chancellor, respected Labour peers and a British economist who won the Nobel Prize for their expertise in poverty.One horried DfID minister confessed to me he thought spending was at least TRIPLE what it should be — yet whenever he tried to thwart wasteful projects, they simply bounced back from officials on to his desk again.It was no surprise to find those pen-pushers in the poverty relief department are among the best-paid bureaucrats in Whitehall.This torrent of cash has fuelled a self-serving aid industry stuffed with fat cats on six-figure salaries in charities and private firms.These people are so focused on protecting their valuable brands that some of the best-known organisations covered up abuse, rape, malpractice and theft.Their political paymasters pose as municent saviours of the world. Yet as I have seen on three continents, much of the money taken from taxpayers is blown on ludicrous projects based on bogus statistics — and ends up doing more harm than good by fostering conflict and undermining democracy.I was in Ghana last year, investigating a UK-funded scheme to pour cash into a few villages to prove aid works.“Far from breaking the poverty trap, the project does not appear to have reduced poverty or hunger at all,” concluded DfID’s own report.Yet we give cash to fast-emerging powerhouses such as China and India.We give cash to countries riddled with corruption, such as Uganda, where I found officials inflating the number of refugees to grab more funds from foreign donors.We give cash to places that have space programmes, even their own aid agencies.And we pour cash into countries run by gangsters spending huge sums on weapons — and in Rwanda’s case, on the brutal president’s favourite Premier League football club, Arsenal.Even North Korea, which runs massive death camps under a bloodstained family dictatorship, has been a beneficiary of UK aid. This is what happens when politicians prioritise spin and spending over needs and reality.Holland has showed a country can get off this hook. It abandoned the target and found the anticipated fuss died down quickly.The sht led to renewed focus on efficient spending, with fewer countries receiving donations. “We were surprised it was so easily dealt with,” one insider told me.Dutch spending has dipped from . per cent of national income in  to . per cent last year and will fall again over the coming years.Let us welcome the dawning realisation in Westminster that fixating on an aid target has been a dire failure.Instead of tinkering with definitions — or deceiving voters by slipping domestic spending under the foreign aid banner — politicians should accept their mistake and abandon that daft targetOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No mother, or family, should have to go through that.The protection of our children is too important to leave to the goodwill of large, profit-orientated organisations. Statutory regulation is needed and as a matter of urgency.She banned Sophie from having a smartphone, imposed tough curbs on her web use and even called the police after discovering the teen had been looking up horric content.But the young girl was able to carry on surfing the internet anyway despite her parents efforts to keep her safe, Mrs Moss said.She warned: Its really hard for parents to do this alone.Relatives of Molly Russell welcomed the NSPCCs call for a legal regulator.A spokesman for the Molly Rose Foundation, set up in her memory, said: Molly’s story has prompted a huge change in public opinion.Many are now aware of how social media companies are failing in their duty of care when it comes to protecting our children.A poll commissioned by the NSPCC found  per cent of parents believe their should be official regulations imposed on social networks."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000251885262.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bible tower babel true amazon prime documentary bible conspiracies","story":"Amazon Prime’s Bible Conspiracy says ruins uncovered at the Borsippa archaeological site have similarities to the tale.In the Book of Genesis people, generations after the Great Flood, all spoke the same language and migrated eastwards to Shinar where they agreed to build a tower tall enough to reach heaven.When God discovered their plan he made everyone speak dferent languages so they could not communicate with each other, causing the plan to be dropped and people dispersed around the world.The documentary states: “The Tower of Babel was said to be a myth by many scholars.“However, a series of cylinders were found in Borsippa which pieced together a huge tower.“These may be part of the Tower of Babel due to their sheer size and evidence of burned stonework.”The presenter continues: “Many believe the tower was destroyed by God, but the text actually tells us it was a strange race, referred to as the Anunnaki.”It is not the first time the Biblical tower has been connected with actual structures.Academics have indicated the Etemenanki ziggurat, dedicated to the god Marduk by Nabopolassar, who ruled Babylonia in around BC, could be the origin of the story.The building, which is said to have stood ft hjgh was eventually destroyed by Alexander the Great in BC. So far the Amazon Prime series has proved to be controversial.Recently it examined the claim that Jesus Christ “was Greek not Jewish”.The docs claim suggests a Greek man named Apollonius may have been the true face behind the New Testament."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000468652545.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"couple prepare to celebrate 75th valentines day together","story":"The lovebirds were first introduced as teens by Cecelia’s youngest brother Bill, who befriended James when he lived close-by in south London in the early s.They tied the knot in December , with James riding his beloved Ariel Red Hunter motorcycle back from his job as a Bevin Boy in the Welsh mines to marry his sweetheart.Today the couple live at Bupa Abbotsleigh Mews care home in Sidcup, South East London where the staff make sure they’re still able to spend time together.As they prepared for their th Valentines Day together Cecilia put their lelong love down to communication and the fact they always worked together to iron out any problems.She added:  “I never thought James and I would still be together after all this time.“Especially after he was called up to the mines during the war – he had no option, he was going whether we liked it or not.Cecelia said: “As a young man, he was very smart – it’s something he’s always been known for.Even after  years, he’s still the same man I married and we’re as in love today as we were on our wedding day.“And because we were married on Christmas Day, it’s always been easy to remember the date.”“We’ve always worked together with whatever we’ve done. We even used to ride a tandem bicycle.”James and Cecelia, who celebrated their th wedding anniversary on Christmas Day , also credit having a large family for maintaining a loving relationship after nearly eight decades.Bupa are planning a special Valentine’s Day meal to celebrate their milestone year together.Recounting the couple’s view on finances, Cecelia explained how they lived through a more frugal era and that they’d only every buy one item at a time on credit.She added: “But that said,we wanted to buy something, you didn’t mind going out and spending money, did you James!”Quick as a flash, James retorted: “Yes, and now I’m skint!” with a twinkle in his eye – showing that even though dementia may be slowing him down, his wit is still as keen as ever.As the duo fussed over one another, thoughts turned to the upcoming Valentine’s Day celebration.Cecelia said: “We don’t really celebrate Valentine’s Day in a big way. We used to - flowers, chocolates, that kind of thing.“We have made home-made cards for each other this year though with help from the staff.”In addition to helping the couple make cards, colleagues at the care home have also planted a rose bush in the grounds to commemorate the pair’s diamond anniversary.Tracey Cheeseman, home manager at Bupa Abbotsleigh Mews, added: “Jim and Ciss really are an inspirational couple – even after  years married, you can tell there’s still a spark.“While Jim’s dementia means he receives specialist care in another wing of the home, we still make sure they spend time together.“It’s heart-warming to watch their relationship continue to grow even after all these years, and so we all wanted to do something special to mark the occasion.”James, whose first job was at a local hardware and iron merchants, added: “When we first met, I thought Cecelia had a lovely way about her.After we were married we were sometime short on money, but we made a decent home because the kids were growing up.“There’s more to le than money – you don’t need to make extravagant purchases. And it was nice to get home at the end of the day to a home-cooked meal.”After the war, James ed to work with Hawkins and Sons – a local hardware merchants – and eventually ended up the general manager until he retired in .Cecelia was a trainee seamstress and as a result frequently made clothes for the family.She would also keep busy with sewing, dressmaking and crocheting as well as

with what we had.”James added: “Looking back at the old times, I remember we had to learn to work together to overcome any troubles we might have had.”Now, the pair pass their time by chatting and eating meals together, while in days gone by the also used to enjoy puzzles.Bevin Boys were men conscripted to work in the mines to provide coal to support the war effort after miners were sent off to fight on the frontlines.With supplies dwindling Jamess job was an engineer who worked on mechanical machinery, rather than spending his days at the coalface.Nearly , Bevin Boys performed vital and

temper","story":"Stephen Waterson, , son of ex-MP Nigel Waterson, allegedly crushed Alfie Lamb either because he wanted more leg room or because he was annoyed, the prosecution said.Duncan Atkinson QC told jurors that Alfies mother Adrian Hoare, , failed her son fundamentally and fatally during the car journey to Croydon, south London, on February  last year.The couple are on trial at the Old Bailey accused of Alfies manslaughter.In a closing speech, Mr Atkinson said Alfie was a happy, active, smiley child.He warned jurors that they should guard against an emotional response to his death when they decide their verdicts.He said: No one is going to suggest either of these defendants wanted Alfie to die.In text messages between them they just wanted their little fatty back, they just wanted him home.Each of them may have called him a little s**t but neither of them set out to hurt him in the way that they did.The question for you is whether Alfie died because without any thought for the consequences, Stephen Waterson moved his chair back, whether because he wanted more room or because Alfie was annoying him, putting Alfie at risk, lashing out at him with his car seat in a fit of childish temper.The further question is whether the person Alfie was most entitled in the whole world to rely on when that happened, and had a duty to protect him from such harm, failed him fundamentally and fatally.Failed him by putting him in such a dangerous place which is why children have car seats, which is why you would never think of putting a child in a footwell.The lawyer told jurors they must look at whether Hoares failing to act was such a fundamental dereliction of duty to her son that she too could be held responsible for his death.He said: Alfie did not have enough room to breathe and that became the case after he was in the footwell and he was compressed in that way either for a short period followed by another period but in any view long enough to cause those irreversible injuries.Mr Atkinson said it was not only the pathology evidence which suggested Alfie died of compression during the journey in Watersons Audi convertible from Sutton to Croydon.The lawyer reminded jurors of the evidence of the other occupants of the car, Emilie Williams and Marcus Lamb.He said: Emilie and Marcus each has much to be criticised for on any view, each could have done more for Alfie by refusing to get in the car at all, by insisting on car seats, by insisting Alfie was not on the floor.You may think their failings cannot absolve any of these defendants for their responsibility for what happened.Watersons three previous convictions for battery also indicated the defendant would lash out violently when challenged, the court heard.Mr Atkinson added that neither of the defendants had explained the expert findings about Alfies injuries because they cannot admit what Stephen Waterson did and Adrian Hoare failed to stop.Hoare, who is originally from north Kent, denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Emilie Williams, who was in the car. Waterson has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and intimidation of the driver Marcus Lamb.The couple and Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making  statements to police.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Temperatures could reach Clater this week in the southern half of the UK.Mid February - Valentines Day - often brings some of the coldest weather of the UK winter but this year it looks like many of us can expect an early taste of spring.The mild conditions are the result of the UK being sandwiched between high pressure over the near continent and areas of low pressure in the Atlantic. They combine to leave the UK under a south or southwesterly air stream which pulls warm air up from northern Africa.Although most computer models show the likelihood of above temperatures for much of the rest of February it is too early to write off the winter. If the continental high pressure block migrates northwards it could open the floodgates to very cold air from the north or east.The warmest Valentines Day on record was in , when .C was clocked in Trivington in Somerset.Although bookies are saying we could see ven hotter this week, the Met Office has said its unlikely.Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: Things look set to take a sizzling turn with every Brit strapping themselves in for their hottest Valentines Day yet - at least on the weather front!The average temperature for this time of year is C in the north and C in the south, but were set to see much higher temperatures this week - the likes of which are normally only seen in spring time.Met Office forecaster Luke Miall told The Sun Online: Most places will have a fine day with lots of sunshine around with mild weather for this time of year. But maximum temperatures will be about C.The highs will most likely be on the north coast of Scotland or the north coast of Wales as a south westerly wind pushes through.It is seeming quite spring-like throughout this week.But its certainly not the end of the cold weather as the mild patch isnt likely to last - a repeat of last Marchs Beast from the East freeze is possible this year.John Hammond, chief meteorologist for Weather Trending, told The Sun Online: We could well see the warmest day of the year so far later this week. On balance, Thursday or Friday could see temperatures reaching the mid-teens in a few places. While this will feel springlike, it’s actually not that unusual for late February.It would be a brave person to say that we’ve said goodbye to the wintry weather. As we saw with last year’s ‘Beast from the East, severe cold and snow can happen in March. But this was an extreme and record-breaking event, so by definition, a repeat this year is unlikely.Indeed, at the moment, there are no indications from computer models for a cold spell as harsh as last year. That said, computer forecasts have been very poor through this winter, so they should not be taken on face value.Snowfalls often occur in March, and so it would unusual for parts of the UK not to see any more of the white stuff this year. However, at this stage it’s impossible to say where or when."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000468621017.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit latest theresa may commons statement","story":"The PM told MPs today we must hold our nerve over Brexit talks as she pleaded with them for more time.Ahead of another crunch set of crucial Commons debates on Thursday, Mrs May admitted thata deal wasnt done soon then Parliament could take control of the whole process.That could mean MPs forcing Britain into delaying Brexit, holding another referendum, or legally ruling out leaving with No Deal at all.In a Commons statement today she said talks were at a crucial stage - but insisted that only by standing firm will we get the changes needed to get Brexit done on time.Some MPs think shes deliberately running down the clock to try and force them into backing her deal at the last moment.The PM is still looking at how to replace the hated Northern Irish backstop with a new plan or to get the EU to agree it needs to be time limited and not trapping the UK in it forever.By getting the changes we need to the backstop by protecting and enhancing workers rights and environmental protections and by enhancing the role of Parliament in the next phase of negotiations I believe we can reach a deal that this House can support, she said.Butthe Government has not secured a majority in this House in favour of a Withdrawal Agreement and a Political Declaration, then the Government will on Tuesday  February make a statement and table an amendable motion relating to the statement and a Minister will move that motion on Wednesday  February, thereby enabling the House to vote on it, and on any amendments to it, on that day.She ruled out staying a part of the EU customs union as Jeremy Corbyn has suggested, saying only her deal would give her Britain a free trade policy in future.However, she will have more talks with the leftie boss this week - and used her speech to insist that she would do more on workers rights as part of her efforts to woo Labour MPs.The PM will do a ring around of the other EU leaders too, to urge them to make the legal changes she wants.Mrs May insisted: We can deliver for the people and the communities that voted for change two and half years ago – and whose voices for too long have not been heard.Earlier today Commons boss Andrea Leadsom said Mrs May was working flat out to get a deal everyone could agree with, and the EU needed to look very carefully about how they could help or Britain would leave without a deal.Its extraordinarily clear what Parliament will support, she told the BBC earlier.What the Prime Minister wants is a bit more time to undertake pretty crucial but delicate negotiations with the EU, to make sure we can sort out the problem of an unlimited backstop.She said the Brexiteers must not be purist in the changes they will accept to support the deal - in a big hint they should back whatever legal changes the PM can wangle.And she insisted the PM isnt even considering Jeremy Corbyns plan to tie the UK to a customs union forever, which sparked huge concerns in the Cabinet.The PMs deal offers all the benefits of a customs union, with the chance to write our own trade policy, she said.However she also refused to say exactly when the next vote on Mrs Mays deal will be, and refused to deny it could be as late as March.Last night Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay held talks with EU boss Michel Barnier over possible new plans for Northern Ireland.But the Frenchman said that it was clear from our side we are not going to re-open the withdrawal agreement as Brexiteers want.More talks are on the cards in the coming days and teams are working to find a way forward, officials said."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT0004650206781.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit theresa may yvette cooper valentines day amendment","story":"Labours Yvette Cooper was expected to launch a second attempt to delay Brexit rather than leaving the EU without a deal.But tonight she announced her rebel group WONT make its move this week -

A cross-party group has been holding secret talks to draw up a fresh version of an amendment tabled by Labour MP Yvette Cooper to extend article .The move, expected to be announced this evening, comes after the Prime Minister asked the Commons for another fortnight’s grace to continue talks with the EU. Mrs May said she needed more time but confirmed they would get another chance to have their say in votes on Brexit on February . But the Remainer MPs want to put her on notice that she will not be able to delay her Brexit “high noon” beyond that point. The Mirror has learned that Ms Cooper plans to table a Brexit amendment along with Tory grandee Sir Oliver Letwin today or tomorrow.   But the pair are NOT expected to put their proposal to a vote until the end of the month - their best chance of getting it through Parliament. One source told the Mirror: “In terms of maximising Tory support for the plan, it’s clear they want to give her one final opportunity to get her deal. “So it’s likely that it will be put to a vote at the end of the month, rather than now. At that stage, there are likely to be Tory resignations over it.” Ms Cooper and Mr Letwin’s plan would remove the time limit for delaying Brexit Day from an earlier version of the amendment, which was defeated by MPs in January. Instead it would make the PM decide theof the extension she would be forced to request from Brussels. Mrs May would also be compelled to give MPs a formal vote before crashing out of the EU without a deal.A handful of Remainer ministers have pledged to quit Governmentthe PM adopts a no deal Brexit policy - or appears to be slipping towards one.  They are thought to include some in Mrs May’s own cabinet including Justice Secretary David Gauke, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and Business Secretary Greg Clark. The Commons rejected an earlier amendment by Ms Cooper that would have forced the PM to ask Brussels for a formal extension to article . The shock defeat,  votes to , came as a crushing disappointment for Remainers who widely expected to block a damaging no deal Brexit. Despite support from the Labour front bench,  Labour rebels turned against the amendment, balancing out  Tory rebels voted in favour of delaying Brexit. One of their key concerns was a suggested delay of nine months in the planned bill. The Labour party agreed to back the movethat was brought down to three months. Ms Cooper has insisted throughout that her aim has been to give the Government more time to negotiate a deal, rather than an attempt to stop Brexit.

But with  days left, Mrs May is expected to plead for more time in her House of Commons statement at .pm - immediately after a meeting of the Tory Cabinet.  The Prime Minister will describe negotiations between Brussels and Dublin over the backstop clause - which could trap the UK in EU customs rules, in order to keep the Irish border open. Downing Street said the statement, which comes a day earlier than expected, will give MPs more time to digest the content ahead of a series of expected Commons votes on Thursday. Mrs May is expected to say: The talks are at a crucial stage. We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House has required and deliver Brexit on time. By getting the changes we need to the backstop by protecting and enhancing workers rights and environmental protections and by enhancing the role of Parliament in the next phase of negotiations I believe we can reach a deal that this House can support.  Votes on her statement this Thursday are non-binding and are widely expected to be a flop. Instead all eyes are on the meaningful vote on a revised -page Brexit deal - which isnt expected until next month. Labour was due to force Mrs May to hold an earlier meaningful vote on her deal, but reports today suggest that is fizzling out. And today top Tory Andrea Leadsom refused to guarantee the vote will happen before an EU summit on March . In a bombshell admission, the Leader of the Commons twice refused to rule out a high-stakes showdown from Monday  March, after the summit and four days before the UK leaves.  Instead she told BBC Radio : Well the PM is seeking to bring back the meaningful vote just as soon as possible. It is a negotiation, it’s not possible to predict the future, but the meaningful vote will come back to Parliament as soon as the issue around the backstop has been sorted out. She said talks were going flat out and insisted: Its not running down the clock. But she did not rule it out.She did, however, claimed the Prime Minister had absolutely ruled out a customs union with the EU - days after Mrs May left the possibility open in a compromise letter to Jeremy Corbyn .Ms Leadsom also insisted laws will be passed in time by Brexit Day despite widespread warnings they will not. Those that need to be passed by  March, Im confident will be passed, she said. Talks are continuing apace between the UK and EU, with Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Mrs Mays de facto deputy, David Lidington, meeting MEPs in Strasbourg today.   On the second leg today Mr Barclay will meet irascible EU Parliament Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt in Strasbourg. The government described a dinner between Mr Barclay and EU negotiator Michel Barnier last night as constructive. But Mr Barniers message earlier in the day yesterday was uncompromising, saying Something has to give on the British side and We are not going to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement. The Withdrawal Agreement is the -page Brexit deal that contains the crucial Irish backstop. Mrs May wants a time limit, exit clause or alternative arrangements to the backstop - which could mean having to reopen talks. That means talks remain in deadlock,  days before we leave.

Your Brexit is important to us. Please hold until a solution is available. Theresa May has long been mocked for her robotic nature, her jerky dancing, frosty demeanour and occasional vocal mals. But since her core purpose, a Brexit deal, was sensationally rejected by MPs, she’s been downgraded from glitchy android to barely al call centre queuing system. And so when she came to update MPs on her progress today, they were treated to the Commons equivalent of forgettable music and preposterous platitudes. You are being held in a queue. Please hold your nerve. We expect your issue to be dealt with within  days.   Yet more worrying was the revelation that the Prime Minister’s bizarre Brexit hold music is a relatively recent development. Jeremy Corbyn stood in front of his MPs, who agree on literally nothing so except that it’d be greatwe could for the love of God JUST GET ON WITH IT. Usually when a minister makes a statement in the Commons, their opposite number is given a copy of the statement ahead of time so they can prepare a response. But according to Corbyn, he was handed Mrs May’s statement just moments before he sat down. He joked that perhaps hapless Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had been tasked with delivering the PMs opus to his office. Even Speaker John Bercow could barely stle a smirk.  In fairness to the Prime Minister’s team, it must be hard to think of new ways to say “nothing has changed” over and over again without using the words “nothing has changed.” But perhaps the most wack-a-doodle claim made by the Prime Minister today is that she wanted to have all this sorted by Christmas. Those with a ing memory may wish to cast their minds back to December th - a full two weeks before Christmas - when she pulled a vote on her deal to avoid an embarrassing defeat. Mrs May presumably also came up with the idea for Pokemon back in the s but never wrote it down. And she has a girlfriend, but you wouldn’t know her because she goes to another school and lives in Canada.  It was said of Apple founder Steve Jobs that he operated in a ‘Reality Distortion Field.’ He had an ability to use charm, bravado and persistence to convince himself and others to swallow almost anything - and to make colleagues believe insurmountable problems were mere bumps in the road. To those of us who live outside Theresa May’s reality distortion field, Theresa May is keeping us on hold, and nobody knows what’s going to happen when Brussels picks up the phone.

The PCS union says the system is crippled by severe under investment, staff shortages and criticism from claimants on how they are treated. Chiefs are demanding , new staff, full contracts for fixed-term workers, an end to management by statistics and a limit on the number of phone calls each case manager has to handle. It comes after top Tories heaped praise on rank-and-file staff in their defence of the six-in-one social security shake-up. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said the strike ballot - which runs to February  - must be a wake-up call to ministers.  He added: Ministers have repeatedly insisted Universal Credit is working well for workers and claimants when the opposite is in fact the case.“Our members have not taken the decision to ballot lightly. But the responsibility for the breakdown in industrial relations lies squarely with the government, who want to run this service into the ground while treating staff with contempt.” If union members at the two service centres agree, two days of industrial action would take place on March -. It comes four years since , Universal Credit staff staged a -hour walkout in protest at the oppressive workplace culture.They complained of staff shortages, poor training and at least poundm squandered on IT that wasnt used.

However, contingency plans have been reviewed recently to ensure services can be maintainedthere is a strike. An official insisted there would be no disruption to claimants. A DWP spokeswoman said: We are disappointed that PCS has chosen to take this course of action and planned meetings with the union are ongoing. Our top priority remains assessing and making payments to customers. We are comfortable with current staffing levels and will monitor and reallocate resource where necessary.

Researchers who carried out a detailed study found seating arrangements, the photographer and the venues decorations are potential flashpoints as tensions build with the date fast approaching. Overall  per cent of the , married adults who took part in the study said they found the process of planning their wedding stressful. Charlotte Hill, Director of Romance at Mercure Hotels, which commissioned the study, said: “Planning a wedding is a huge challenge, and expectations for the big day are understandably sky-high, so it’s no surprise Brits want to put the work in to make sure everything goes smoothly.   “However, tackling some of the big choices in plenty of time, such as finding the perfect venue, dress and caterer, can take care of the lion’s share of the stress of planning a wedding.” The study also found well-researched wedding planners manage to get their venue shortlist down to just two, making a final decision after visiting the locations. Brides will try on four dferent wedding dresses on average before deciding on the perfect look for their big day. Eighty three per cent of engaged Brits are heavily involved in the planning of their own wedding, while the remaining  per cent happily take a backseat and let someone  do the work. Other than their other half, mum has the biggest say in decisions, with one in four saying their mum played a pivotal role in the planning.  Brides are most likely to focus on issues affecting the dress, the seating arrangements and the decorations, while grooms tackle the venue, the catering and booking the honeymoon. Only nine per cent decided to hire a wedding planner to help the process run more smoothly, it emerged. One in six start planning their wedding within a week of the proposal, and one in four wait a month for the dust to settle on the engagement before they get to work. Eighty six per cent of married Brits thought their wedding day went as planned, though they also think proceedings could have benefited from another five months of planning. Three in  would organise their wedding plans dferentlythey had the chance to do it all over again.  And  per cent said making decisions about their wedding led to arguments and disagreements with people trying to help. Of these,  per cent fell out with their partner over an element of the wedding, and one in four had some choice words for their mother-in-law. One in four married Brits confessed they made a handful of decisions about their wedding day just to keep their parents, or in-laws, happy, and  per cent were careful to ensure older family traditions were observed. Three in  Brits, surveyed by OnePoll, chose a signicant date in the calendar to propose to their other half. Of those who picked a special day to propose on, their partner’s birthday was the most popular choice, followed by Valentine’s Day and New Year’s Eve.  When looking for inspiration for things to do for their own weddings, one in five will think back to the weddings of their friends to see what they can copy or top at their own, while one in seven will scour social media.

The lovebirds were first introduced as teens by Cecelia’s youngest brother Bill, who befriended James when he lived close-by in south London in the early s. They tied the knot in December , with James riding his beloved Ariel Red Hunter motorcycle back from his job as a Bevin Boy in the Welsh mines to marry his sweetheart. Today the couple live at Bupa Abbotsleigh Mews care home in Sidcup, South East London, where the staff make sure they’re still able to spend time together.  As they prepared for their th Valentines Day together, Cecilia put their lelong love down to communication and the fact they always worked together to iron out any problems. She added: “I never thought James and I would still be together after all this time. “Especially after he was called up to the mines during the war – he had no option, he was going whether we liked it or not. Cecelia said: “As a young man, he was very smart – it’s something he’s always been known for. Even after  years, he’s still the same man I married and we’re as in love today as we were on our wedding day.  “And because we were married on Christmas Day, it’s always been easy to remember the date.” “We’ve always worked together with whatever we’ve done. We even used to ride a tandem bicycle.” James and Cecelia, who celebrated their th wedding anniversary on Christmas Day , also credit having a large family for maintaining a loving relationship after nearly eight decades. Bupa are planning a special Valentine’s Day meal to celebrate their milestone year together. Recounting the couple’s view on finances, Cecelia explained how they lived through a more frugal era and that they’d only every buy one item at a time on credit.  She added: “But that said,we wanted to buy something, you didn’t mind going out and spending money, did you James!” Quick as a flash, James retorted: “Yes, and now I’m skint!” with a twinkle in his eye – showing that even though dementia may be slowing him down, his wit is still as keen as ever. As the duo fussed over one another, thoughts turned to the upcoming Valentine’s Day celebration. Cecelia said: “We don’t really celebrate Valentine’s Day in a big way. We used to - flowers, chocolates, that kind of thing. “We have made home-made cards for each other this year though with help from the staff.” In addition to helping the couple make cards, colleagues at the care home have also planted a rose bush in the grounds to commemorate the pair’s diamond anniversary. Tracey Cheeseman, home manager at Bupa Abbotsleigh Mews, added: “Jim and Ciss really are an inspirational couple – even after  years married, you can tell there’s still a spark.  “While Jim’s dementia means he receives specialist care in another wing of the home, we still make sure they spend time together. “It’s heart-warming to watch their relationship continue to grow even after all these years, and so we all wanted to do something special to mark the occasion.” James, whose first job was at a local hardware and iron merchants, added: “When we first met, I thought Cecelia had a lovely way about her. After we were married we were sometime short on money, but we made a decent home because the kids were growing up. “There’s more to le than money – you don’t need to make extravagant purchases. And it was nice to get home at the end of the day to a home-cooked meal.” After the war, James ed to work with Hawkins and Sons – a local hardware merchants – and eventually ended up the general manager until he retired in . Cecelia was a trainee seamstress and as a result frequently made clothes for the family.  She would also keep busy with sewing, dressmaking and crocheting as well as designing and making wedding dresses. Once their three children, James, Marion and Ann, were older she also worked at Peek Freans biscuit factory in Bermondsey. In the s, she moved to help James at Hawkins and Sons in south London, working as a bookkeeper for  years. The pair have been retired since . Until , they used to accompany each other to the shops every day. The couple have seven grandchildren and  great-grandchildren. Cecelia said: “If you can see that your family is happy and content, then that makes you happy. People in our generation didn’t ask a lot from le, we were happy with what we had.”  James added: “Looking back at the old times, I remember we had to learn to work together to overcome any troubles we might have had.” Now, the pair pass their time by chatting and eating meals together, while in days gone by the also used to enjoy puzzles. Bevin Boys were men conscripted to work in the mines to provide coal to support the war effort after miners were sent off to fight on the frontlines. With supplies dwindling Jamess job was an engineer who worked on mechanical machinery, rather than spending his days at the coalface.

Its a bit like Nandos so we ordered our chicken. I turned to William and said I fancied I corn on the cob so I asked the guy behind the counterhe did it.

Last year a YouGov study revealed how more than  per cent of people in Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire use the word cob for a bread roll.

The -year-old student can be seen walking towards The Welly Club on January  at about .pm. She is reported to have arrived at the club with three friends. However the student was turned away by doormen who believed she was too drunk before friends put her into a taxi to go home. The new footage was recorded by a camera on a business next to the club in Hull.  The owner of the CCTV, property agent Lukasz Rybus told the Daily Mail: I want Libby to be found, to be back with her family and friends. This footage shows that she was dressed all in black and seems to be wearing lighter coloured trainers or boots. I just hope that this footage helps jog someones memory,it helps someone remember seeing her, that can only be a positive thing. Libby arrived home about two miles away on Wellesley Avenue at .pm - although she is not thought to have entered the property for reasons which are not known.  She was seen on Beverley Road at .pm near to a bench and close to the junction with Haworth Street, when a motorist stopped and offered her help.

Polish-born butcher Pawel Relowicz, , a married father-of-two, was arrested last Wednesday, on suspicion of abduction. He was questioned by detectives until Sunday night when he was bailed but he remains a suspect. A massive search has been underway since the day following her disappearance, with dozens of officers seen combing nearby streets including Beresford Avenue and Haworth Street, as well as the nearby Barmston Drain.  Some officers remain at Oak Road playing fields and are now using chainsaws to clear some of the vegetation in the search area. A number of police officers have conducted door-to-door enquiries, while Humberside Police also launched a digital billboard campaign in a bid to find the missing student. Search teams with wooden sticks and police ers have also been used in the search although they have still been unable to find her.  More than  students from the University of Hull handed out leaflets on the streets of Hull last week. The flyers, produced in four dferent languages, appealed for any information that could lead to finding Libby. A ft wide billboard asking for information was also stationed outside The Welly. Detective Superintendent Matthew Hutchinson said on Saturday: We are still treating Libbys disappearance as a missing persons inquiry.  I have said previously that we are keeping an open mind as to her whereabouts and that is still very much the case. Our number one priority is to find Libby Squire and we are still conducting extensive searches and appealing for any information from the public.

Cyclist and fitness fanatic Chris Peach, , spent six weeks in a coma after suffering a series of catastrophic injuries when he was hit by a Mercedes HGV driven by Mark Philpott, , in Freetown Way, west Hull, on November , . But big-hearted Mr Peach said he bears the driver no ill feeling and told him to get on with his le, Hull Live reports. After making a remarkable recovery following a four-month stay in hospital, Mr Peach attended Philpotts sentencing hearing at Hull Crown Court on Monday and revealed he was back in the saddle.   Before he was invited to give evidence in front of Judge Mark Bury, prosecutor Charlotte Baines said: He would like to reach out to Mr Philpott to tell him it is all OK and he should get on with his le as best as possible. Philpott, Oldham, became emotional in the dock on hearing that and wiped tears from his eyes. He denied causing serious injury by dangerous driving but admitted careless driving. Philpott, who was heading for the M after making a delivery in Sutton Fields, was switching lanes to turn left onto Ferensway when he collided with Mr Peach, an experienced cyclist who was wearing high visibility clothes and equipment, and had lights on his bike and helmet. Miss Baines said a witness heard a strange banging noise and saw that there appeared to be some debris in the road, and he realised that was a cycle and an inidual in what he described as a crumpled mess.   Mr Peach, a town planner who had been cycling to and from work for  years, could remember nothing after going to get on his bicycle at pm. His injuries included fractures to his face, spine, jaw, sternum, ribs, arm, shoulder, elbow and toes, as well as a collapsed lung and kidney failure. Asked by the judge how it was to by cycling on the same route home again, Mr Peach said: Im a bit slower than I used to be but its fine. A little bit nerve-wracking. :I realise accidents happen and you have to be careful, and most of the time when youre careful youre OK. Nobodys saying you were not careful on the day in question, the judge said. Mr Peach, a triathlete, said he had begun swimming and running again, but not as much as he used to and said: Age has caught up with me and the accident has caught up with me. I dont know whether to regard you as lucky or unlucky, Judge Bury said. Mr Peach said: I consider myself lucky. Theres plenty of le left even though it might not quite be as I planned it. Its still left to enjoy.   Philpott also became emotional when told he would not be losing his licence. He was fined pound and had six points put on his licence. The judge told him: Where you are culpable is when you were stationary you failed to appreciate Mr Peach cycling up behind you. He was there to be seen in high visibility equipment and lights, and had you been paying proper attention you would have seen him, should have seen him, and therefore before you manoeuvred into the left hand lane you would have ensured he was not in the way of your lorry - thats your failing.

Hannah Morris, , was devastated when she lost her amniotic fluid just  weeks after falling pregnant with twins and claims that doctors repeatedly urged her to abort. But the brave mum-of-three says she acted on a gut instinct and refused to follow the doctors advice - and is now proud mum to two-year-olds George and Alfie King. Hannah was diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of the membraneswhen her first amniotic sac burst at  weeks and second around three weeks later. She claims an untreated E. coli infection may have caused her waters to break  weeks early. Both children were left vulnerable to infection in the womb and doctors reportedly said it was unlikely their vital organs would develop properly and their limbs would be stuck together. Hannah claims that doctors recommended terminating her pregnancy as a get out clause to treating the babies.  She is now speaking out to call for better education for doctors and awareness for the public on the pregnancy complication. Hannah, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, said: The negativity from the NHS was absolutely abominal. She added: A lot of the doctors had not go a clue what to do with me. It was like it was their get out clause to say have a termination because it was easier to say get rid of the babies than to actually treat PPROM. There needs to be more education and they need to be taught what to do. The compassion that they had in that situation was so cold and so negative that when I was trying to fight for my babies lives it felt like they didnt care. I understand the NHS is under massive strain and theyre trying to make savings, but I was trying to save my babies.   I wasnt given a leaflet, I wasnt given any advice or counselling. Nothing like that was provided. I had to sort out help on my own. For somebody  who is maybe a little less savvy or emotional and cant deal with the situation as well, they wouldnt necessarily go and look for help. You trust your doctor and what they say to you you think is going to be the right option. You trust the medical professionals that are looking after you. They completely failed me. If I had listened to these people I would have terminated my pregnancy and my sons wouldnt be here today. Its devastating. Hannah and her partner Mark King, , were over the moon when they found out that they were going to have twins in January . A urine sample taken at Hannahs -week scan revealed that the mum-to-be had an asymptomatic E. coli infection but she claims that she was not treated with antibiotics. After her waters broke for the first time, Hannah claims she was rushed to Bolton Royal Hospital and the couple were heartbroken when they were warned that neither child had any chance of surviving.Hannah, who is a stay-at-home mum, said: I had an internal examination and the doctor told me that my waters had broken, and he was really sorry but there was nothing they could do for us.   I asked a million questions, can the other baby survive  Can it reseal  They said, no, there was a  per cent chance that this baby wont survive, you need to have to have some medicine to induce labour, its your only option. For some reason, I dont know why, I didnt want to do that. My gut was telling me not to follow the advice. I said  I am going to lose them I lose them naturally and Ill let nature take its course. The doctor left me in this side room and not one single doctor or nurse or healthcare professional came in this room for  hours. They just left me and my partner to miscarry our children. After two days of waiting in hospital to miscarry, a scan revealed that both babies appeared healthy and the couple were sent home. Hannah turned to voluntary organisation Little Heartbeats for support and decided to put herself on bedrest to give her babies the best chance of survival. She would lose water every time she moved and found even simple tasks such as going to the toilet extremely dficult.   She avoided baths and drank up to eight litres of water a day to keep her water supplies as replenished as possible. Hannah said: A week after I was first in hospital I had a follow-up appointment and we met with a doctor who put a care plan in place for us but told usthey got to  weeks, which is viability, their limbs would be stuck to their bodies. [They told us] their lungs wont be developed and their kidneys wont be developed. Choosing to carry on was immensely inhumane and was the worst thing I could do because my babies were  per cent goners. [They said] I was only causing them more pain by carrying on with the pregnancy. We were considering at this point terminating the pregnancies because this was coming from top consultants. We went home to think about it and I decided to do my own research and found Little Heartbeats and information on PPROM and found that there were charities out there who support women going through this. Every day was touch and go. Each time I would go to the toilet I would lose fluid. Every time I stood up I would lose waters. I knew that it was a really serious thing. If I had been walking around I would have lost my children. The NHS didnt advise me to go on bed rest, it was from my own research that I decided that was the best option. I avoided baths and swimming pools. I was drinking water as much as I could to replenish what I was losing, seven or eight litres a day. It was really, really dficult to stay positive and stay mentally sane as well. It was extremely dficult and we did feel very isolated as a family as well. But we knew that we were having a scan every week too. Each week we would go for this scan and we would be reassured that the scan showed our babies were healthy and fine. Thats what pushed us to carry on with the pregnancy every single week. We would see the boys on the screen and they would be fine. Against all the odds, Hannah made it to  weeks and planned a C-section with her doctors. George was born first weighing lb oz and Alfie at lb oz, and both spent four days in NICU. Despite Alfie being born with holes in his heart and George suffering a weakened immune system due to his premature birth, both toddlers are now healthy and thriving. Hannah said: Taking our boys home was amazing. Just to know that we were right and that we had made the right decision by our children. They had defeated all the odds and they were strong, healthy little boys. They are now so cheeky and you look at them and think, wow, you nearly werent here. I think there needs to be more awareness of PPROM. We werent given any leaflets or help. Ciara Curran, founder of Little Heartbeats, said: Hannah and her little surviving PPROM babies are living proof these babies can survive with little to zero fluids. A spokesperson for Bolton NHS Foundation Trust said: We are really sorry to hear about this. We do not comment on inidual cases. However, we would be happy to meet with Hannah to discuss directly with her.

The murderer known as Jack the Stripper claimed more victims than his Victorian namesake Jack the Ripper during a grisly spree in the s – but the monster was never caught. Now, new information could lead to the identity of the man behind the Hammersmith nude murders. David Wilson, a former prison governor and professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, has handed evidence he collected to the Met Police, who are considering it. After a -month probe – detailed in a BBC documentary tonight – Prof Wilson is convinced Jack the Stripper was Welsh child killer Harold Jones. He says he found crucial links between Jones and the murder of at least six sex workers in the then red light district of West London around Shepherd’s Bush.   The sadistic crimes, in which the killer strangled and stripped his victims before removing their teeth, sparked one of the biggest manhunts in history. “Lots of people put forward dferent theories about the identity of the killer,” says Prof Wilson. “But, frankly, only one really stands out. Andwe could prove this theory, it has every possibility of delivering to the Met something they didn’t have  years ago, and that’s a genuine prime suspect.”  Jones died of bone cancer in Hammersmith in , and the children of Jack the Stripper’s victims still await justice. One of the first victims, -year-old prostitute Hannah Tailford, originally from Northumberland, was found dead on February , , her body fished out of the Thames at Hammersmith.   She had been strangled, several of her teeth were missing and her underwear had been forced down her throat. Her son Steven Sloman, , said: “The general attitude then was just, ‘Well, it’s just a prostitute’. “At the end of the day, whatever happened, she was a mum. “Justice was not done and I would like them to open to case, find evidence and maybe come up with closure, and say, ‘It could have been this person here’.”  By the time of the killings – the other victims were pregnant Irene Lockwood, , Helen Barthelemy, , Mary Fleming, , Frances Brown, , and Bridget O’Hara,  – Jones was already a convicted double child killer. When he was , Jones murdered Freda Burnell, eight, in Abertillery, Monmouthshire, but was acquitted due to lack of physical evidence. Just  days later, he murdered -year-old Florence Little, hiding her body in his parents’ attic, and confessed to murdering Freda after his second trial. He escaped hanging due to his age and was instead got  years’ jail. After his release from Wandsworth Prison in , he joined the Merchant Navy.  Then, according to Prof Wilson in documentary Dark Son: The Hunt for a Serial Killer, Jones changed his name to Harold Stevens and moved to Fulham, near Shepherd’s Bush – putting him in the area when the murders took place in  and . Prof Wilson also found a link between Jones and an industrial estate where police think bodies were kept before being dumped. There is also evidence he worked as a  beater, giving him access to paint found on four victims. And like Jack the Stripper, Prof Wilson presents evidence of Jones storing his victims’ bodies and having sadistic tendencies.  “These women were shysadistically murdered and because of that sadism – which had a sexual shyovertone – they lost their lives,” he said. “Sadism doesn’t dissipate over time, sadism always finds some way of expressing itself in terms of the killer’s le and lestyle. “There is an uncanny mirroring of these early murders in the s and how aspects are reappearing in those murders in the s.”Dark Son: The Hunt for a Serial Killer is on BBC at pm on Tuesday night and its available on BBC iPlayer now."},{"url":null,"title":"nurses tragic final message after","story":"NewsTragic nurses final message after being told SIX TIMES she didnt have cancerJulie O’Connor, , said her suffering was “disgusting” as shes propped up in her hospice bed three days before her deathShareCommentsByAndrew GilpinNeil Murphy:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news offline video husband-shares-emotional-video-dying-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA terminally-ill nurse used a heartbreaking final message to criticise the hospital she claims missed several chances todiagnose her cancer. Julie O’Connor, , said the way she suffered was “disgusting” in a video shot just before she died. She said doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol did not spot she was suffering from cervical cancer as shes seen propped up in her hospice bed, only able to whisper. The mum-of-two who worked for the NHS for  years, said: “I think it took six attempts for the cancer to be diagnosed. It’s disgusting I have been suffering the way I have and I continue to suffer. During the video, Julie appears weak and short of breath as she recounts her ordeal to the camera. She died three days after it was shot at St Peters Hospice in Bristol. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@trinitymirror  Julie, of Thornbury, Glos, complained of symptoms in , but a test came back negative. She added she had numerous biopsies and examinations, but that it was not until three years after the initial diagnosis a private consultant informed her she had cancer. Husband Kevin then tells the camera doctors failed to diagnose her illness over a period of three years. We hold them fully accountable, he says. The pathologist and the gynaecologist, who had several opportunities to intervene, I hold them responsible, and I do hold the board of directors at North Bristol Trust accountable.  They put me and Julie through this. What we want to do with this video is to show the board of directors what they’ve done. What they’ve done to me and Julie and our family. And I just hope this doesn’t happen to anybody . We want a wider review. Dr Chris Burton, of North Bristol NHS Trust, said: “We are committed to understanding the full circumstances of the care we provided so we can improve our services. “We’ll be publicly open with the findings of the independent [probe] we’ve commissioned.” Last year Julie told the Bristol Post that in  was given the all clear, despite that result being wrong. Three years later, after what Julie describes as a “catalogue of errors”, her cancer spread out of control and became incurable.  “It’s too late now to cure me. I am having chemotherapy and radiotherapy but all they can do is give me palliative care to prolong my le,” Julie said back then. “If they had caught it back in  or even  it could’ve been a completely dferent story. “My main concern now is making sure that other women who had tests back in  and  are aware thatthey are having ongoing symptoms or think something is wrong they should challenge the results and get retested,” she added. Julie sued the hospital and going public with her story had been dficult for her family, especially her two children.  “But they understand that we are trying to help other women who might be given this devastating news,” she said. “The hospital are saying it is only me whose tests were wrong but they are reluctant to do a wider review of other smears even though we have pleaded with them to. “The last thing I want to do is put people off having smears, but just to question thingsyou are having symptoms like I was then challenge it and push it further,” she added.

Jovan Hill compares himself to reality TV stars the Kardashians with his online begging paying for a swish flat and all his bills. Earning five times the pound monthly salary he made working in a fast food restaurant, before quitting in January  to beg full-time, Jovan, , believes his money-making venture has also found him fame. Jovan, of Brooklyn, New York, USA, said: Im Twitter famous! It’s clear that Im providing my followers with a service and that’s why they give me money. There are some people who dont like what I do, but I think it’s more of a jealousy thing.Essentially, Im like the Kardashians – sitting on the couch moaning, throwing out a few jokes, but still getting paid. Sometimes I even get recognised in the street by my followers.   MaybeI looked dferent and wore a suit every day I would be on the Forbes list of the most successful businessmen of the year for coming up with this strategy.” Jovan fell into full-time begging after appealing to his followers - a fraction of the number he has now - in December  on the online live streaming service Periscope, telling them how work was driving him mad and asking them to pay him, which they did. Beforehand in March , he had been working in a fast food eatery, earning pound a month, but he loathed it. I had a few real jobs before what I do now, he explained. I was a health care assistant at an elderly peoples home while I was at college and, after that, I went to work at a fast food joint, when I dropped out. None of it felt like me and I hated it, so I asked my followers to give me money and they obliged! I couldnt believe it the first time I was given around pound. Concerned for her sons happiness, his mum, Veronica Hill, , a nurse, gave him some money, so he could move to New York to build a new le there.   Little did she know that he would find a lucrative career - as an apparent beggar. “Now that I have K followers that stretch all the way from the US to Singapore, my mum continues to be very supportive, said Jovan. I showed her my analytics. I get up to  million impressions a month - but it didn’t mean much to her. She’s still really happy for me, though. And while his dad, Christopher Robins, , who works in IT, could not understand how his son was making money at first, Jovan says he has now warmed to the idea. He laughed: At first, he didn’t understand it at all – but he’s starting to come around to the idea of what I do.” The secret to his success, according to Jovan, is his sparkling sense of humour. My tweets and live streams are very entertaining, he said. Its online comedy, so why shouldnt I be paid  When I was still working in the restaurant and went offline for a while, my followers missed me. I am providing a service and Millennials understand that entertainment and comedians arent just on TV or stages anymore - they can exist solely on Twitter, like me.   Although Jovan, who is gay, had been making people laugh online since dropping out of his political science course at Texas State University in early , when he first moved to New York, he had just k Twitter followers. But his amusing tweets about homosexuality and modern pop culture, soon saw his followers creeping up to k, alongside which money from his fans began steadily streaming into his Patreon account - a membership  for creators to run a subscription content service. While Jovan expected to make some money, he was astonished when he saw just how much cash he was raking in. He admitted: “The only thing I didn’t expect was the amount of money – I’m not rich or anything, but I make enough to live comfortably. “It just ended up working out for me. I asked my followers exactly what they wanted, so I could provide it and get paid in . “I also get donations while I’m on a live stream – where I chat to my fans about my day and theirs - which I usually do between three to four times a day for an hour or so. These pay for anything extra. The donations y, but sometimes people donate up to pound in one go.” But Jovan does not expect to be an online star forever and hopes that prospective employers will be keen to take him on, after seeing that he has the Midas touch and witnessing his online fame. Now living in Echo Park, LA, with the hope of following more stardom, Jovan explained: “I thought going into this that I might get hired as a social media manager since I had proved how good I was at it on my own account. “Half of what people follow me for is my commentary. I thought this would be useful for viral content and celebrities – and hoped I might be approached to tweet for other people. Instead, I’m still just tweeting for myself, so essentially, I have become my own social media manager. “But more brands and TV networks are starting to notice me and my online influence – so that might change in the future. Right now I don’t really take money from brands - I rely on my followers enjoying what I do and paying me for it.” Trolling is a persistent problem for Jovan, who admits that not everyone agrees with how he makes a living.   He said: “I get hate all the time and every day. Someone is always mad. At the end of the day, I’m still making my money and I’m fine. I don’t have to worry about them. My followers don’t give a s**t!” “People seem to think that me getting the money means a homeless person may not get it, but the fact is my followers aren’t going to give them money because they don’t care. They care about social media more. “And I dont overspend. I dont buy major luxuries and wouldn’t buy Gucci with my followers’ cash. I would feel weird doing that. If I had a brand deal with a designer I would, but otherwise, I wouldn’t.” Despite his success, Jovan does worry about the fact his le revolves around social media. He said: “Sometimes I think, Oh my god why did I ever start this – my le depends on this now and I can’t stop. I must constantly be online and constantly make sure people enjoy what I’m doing. It’s exhausting.   “So many people talk to me every day – it’s a lot more work than I imagined. I’m not complaining about it, but it can be tough sometimes. Regarding himself as an influencer on social media, he is keen to tell other young people not to take the whole phenomenon too seriously. He said: “My recommendation to other kids thinking about doing this is to please branch out your hobbies, too. Dont only do this. “I would say go and be the best you can be, andit happens and you become an influencer, it happens. Most people I know who have, fell into it by accident. Too many kids think they have to post a certain kind of way or look a certain kind of way – but they dont. Just enjoy yourself and do whatever makes you happy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man tried explain difference between","story":"NewsMan tried to explain dference between vagina and vulva - and it didnt go wellA guy got himself into a spot of trouble online after he tried to explain the dference between vulva and vagina to womenShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  FEB NewsA man has come under fire online for trying to explain the dference between vagina and vulva\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email On Sunday,published a photo story which looked at  dferent womens vulva.As youd expect, the article elicited a number of interesting responses from people on social media, with the story being shared more than , times.However there was one reply in particular that caught peoples eye on Twitter - but it captured attention for all the wrong reasons.A man named Paul Bullen replied to the newspaper, telling them: The correct word is vagina.

I am taking issue with those who are telling them they should not do that.

Even a doctor does not ask Would you like to see the fetus.

One person wrote: Imagine arguing to a woman what her own body parts are called. Ffs.

A third wrote: Paul, love, my -year-old knows its a vulva. Calm yourself and read a biology book. Even a gynecologist felt the need to get involved and sent Paul a helpful Venn diagram on the dferences between the vulva and vagina.

The Bible story details how two of every type of animal are saved from floods by a huge boat. However, the Genesis story also goes on to say how humans in the aftermath of the deluge began to build the Tower of Babel. The huge structure is used to explain how erse human languages were brought into existence.  It says how in a bid to hamper the construction of the tower, which Babylonians claimed could reach the heavens, God confused the languages of the the workers so they could no longer communicate. The tower was never completed and people were dispersed across the face of the earth. Now the Bible Conspiracies documentary claims a discovery in the Babylon Province of Iraq matches the tale.  The presenter explains how archaeologists believe that the remains matched the description of the famous tower, due to the discovery of a series of cylinders surrounded by burnt bricks, the Daily Star reports. “The investigation goes on to explain how the Bible says the structure would later be destroyed by angels under God’s orders. “Many believe the tower was destroyed by God, but the text actually tells us it was a strange race, referred to as the Anunnaki.  “These Anunnaki were described as coming from the heavens, sent to guide humans. “In times gone by they were called angels, but today we might call them aliens.” Bible Conspiracies has been given . stars and is free to watch for members of the paid-for subscription service.  The documentary also claims the true son of God was not Jesus, but a Greek philospher. The -minute show says: Hidden in the Bible are ancient secrets. The marriage of Jesus and Mary and their children the destruction of the tower of Babel by an alien race called the Anunnaki, and the hidden code that holds the revelation about future events. One of the claims is that Jesus has been confused with a Greek philosopher who lived at the same time.  Stories shared in the Bible about Jesus le, and the miracles he performed in the New Testament, may have been mistaken forPreacher Apollonius of Tyan. The series claims Apollonius became famous, building a religious following as he preached and performed miracles. It says: “There is, in fact, a man who can be found in text outside of the Bible after the church failed to eradicate him from history. “His name is Apollonius and he was born in the rd or th year BC in Tyana in Cappadocia, Anatolia.  “He became a disciple of Pythagoras renouncing flesh, wine and women. He wore no shoes and let his hair and beard grow long. He reportedly restored le to the dead and spoke of things beyond the human reach. And, unlike Jesus, there is evidence to prove that Apollonius actually existed. More than half of all the customers to review the show gave it one star, the lowest possible.

New Zealander Karl Waters was trying to catch a trout when the four-foot whitetip reef shark ripped into his right forearm. Gruesome photographs show Karl bleeding from deep lacerations as he raced back to the shore from remote waters off the coast of Australias Northern Territory The -year-old was hospitalised and given  stitches.  But extraordinarily, Karl has revealed its not even his first time coming between the jaws of a shark - yet he has vowed to waste no time ing to the water as soon as he recovers. Karl, originally from Temuka, New Zealand, said: The shark definitely had no intention of biting me, but it accidentally ended up with my arm in his mouth. In that situationyou panic you run out of oxygen quick, so I kept my cool and made sure he hadnt hit any major arteries when I swam back to the boat. Surprisingly there wasnt too much pain, it just felt like something squeezing my arm. Karl met paramedics at a boat ramp at Umbakumba before he was picked up by air doctors CareFlight and transported to Royal Darwin Hospital to be stitched up.   It was less than a year ago that Karl last found himself in a similar place in New Zealand when he escaped serious injury after being bitten by a sevengill shark. But he said he is fully aware of the risk he runs by entering the habitat of apex predators and has not let either attack put him off the ocean.

The last execution in Sri Lanka was  years ago, but President Maithripala Sirisena wants to resume the use of capital punishment for drug traffickers in the next two months. During a state visit to the Philippines in January, Sirisena had praised President Rodrigo Dutertes drug policies, despite international criticism of a campaign that has resulted in thousands of people being killed in encounters with police. Drug trafficking is a capital offence in Sri Lanka although no one has been executed for any crime in the country since .   Sri Lankas last hangman quit in  without ever having to execute anyone, citing stress after seeing the gallows for the first time. Another hired last year never turned up for work. Anticipating that capital punishment could soon be used again, the prison service is hurrying to recruit two executioners. Prison service spokesman Thushara Upuldeniy told Reuters: We never knowthe government will resume the death penalty, but we want to hire two hangmen to fill vacancies and be readythe government wants to execute drug traffickers.   An advertisement published in the state-run Daily News on Monday put the monthly pay at , rupees , which would be above average for a government job. Candidates should be Sri Lankan, male, aged between  and , and have both excellent moral character and mental strength. Upuldeniya said the job interviews will be conducted next month. At least  people convicted for drugs offences, including two drug dealers, could be executed, Upuldeniya said. There were also  people including six women on death row for ious crimes including murder, he said.

These remarkable images, said to be the first clear ones in  years of the creature, show the leopard out hunting for prey. They were captured by Will Burrad-Lucas, , from Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, at Kenyas Laikipia Wilderness Camp last month. The wildle snapper took the unusual images using a Camtraptions Camera Trap - a camera which has a motion sensor to detect when animals are there. The high-quality system made it possible to see the majestic black leopard, a rarely photographed big cat, despite it being dark.  Wills images showcase the animals dazzling yellow eyes as it steps out in the night, under a full moon, to hunt for prey. The photographer said: I took the photos last month and believe the black panther, in this case a melanistic African leopard, is around two years old. Black panthers are iconic creatures and yet very few images of wild black panthers exist. This is not just because leopards are extremely secretive and hard to see, but also because only a tiny percentage of leopards are completely black.  Since childhood I have been fascinated by stories of black panthers. In Africa, black leopards are incredibly rare and until now, the only images of them have been fleeting shots taken from great distance or graining images from low-quality trail cameras. He added: As far as I know, this is the first series of high-quality camera trap images of a wild black leopard ever captured in Africa. The appearance of the animal - which has barely visible spots - is the result of melanism, Mail Online reports.The opposite of albinism, this rare genetic iation causes a surplus of pigment in an animals skin or hair.   In photographing the striking black leopard, Will said he had achieved his childhood dream.Nicholas Pilfold PhD, a lead researcher for a leopard conservation program in Laikipia County, Keyna, said: We had always heard about black leopard living in this region, but the stories were absent of high quality footage that could confirm their existence. The scientist at San Diego Zoo Global added: This is what Wills photos and the videos on our remote cameras now prove, and are exceptionally rare in their detail and insight. Collectively these are the first confirmed images in nearly  years of black leopard in Africa, and this region is the only known spot in all of Africa to have black leopard.

It basically is the start of the season for me and I have so many games left to finish up on a positive note.“I’m hungry, I know the challenge here to get back to the Premiership and that’s the aim.”As well as a fresh start away from his injury woes in Milton Keynes, Pawlett is delighted to be reunited with boss Robbie Neilson.It was the United gaffer who took Pawlett south of the border with MK Dons at that point in League One after leaving Aberdeen.Pawlett added: “I’ve, obviously, worked with the manager before so I know what to expect and I really enjoy working under him.“I like his passion, his thought-process fits with the way I play, I think, and I get on with him really well.“We have an understanding from each other – I know what he wants and he knows what he’s going to get from me.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c618efadbfbd5.08419022.jpg ","title":"far travelled dundee star ryan mcgowan says scots footballers are luckier than they think","story":"Far-travelled Ryan McGowan believes Scottish footballers don’t realise how lucky they are as they make their way in the game without having to give up their home comforts.When the -year-old signed for Dundee on loan from Bradford City at the end of last month, it took his tally of clubs in a -year senior career to .And having turned out for outfits in his native Australia, Scotland, China, the United Arab Emirates and England during that period, he’s clocked up more air miles that your average long-haul airline pilot.Having always known he’d have to travel round the world to make a career in football, the Socceroo believes it’s made him more open to hop from one country to another.That, he’s learned, is in contrast to many of the friends he’s made here in Scotland.“Scottish kids probably don’t realise how lucky they are. They’ve got something like  full-time clubs within a three-hour drive of where they’ve grown up,” he said.“When I was growing up in Adelaide, we had one team and then it was a two-hour flight to the next closest.“Soyou weren’t good enough for that team, you had to work harder and be prepared to sht around.“I know boys here who only want to play for teams in or near Edinburgh – and they can.“Scottish boys are very lucky to have so many clubs and opportunities without having to move.”While he’s no regrets about his nomadic career, McGowan admits the chance to hang around in one place for a prolonged period is growing more attractive.Particularlythat place is here in Scotland, the country he regards as his adopted home.“I do sometimes think I’d love to sign a two or three-year contract somewhere again,” he added.“I would have probably have loved to have stayed on at Hearts for a couple of more seasons and I was enjoying my time at United when I was there but bids came in and were accepted.“And having an Australian passport does open doors in Asia, which is why I’ve ended up there a few times.”If the chance arises to stay at Dundee long-term, he admits it’s something he will give serious thought.He has not, and will not, look that far ahead until he’s helped the Dark Blues out of their current predicament.“A couple of weeks ago moving to Dundee hadn’t even come onto my horizon. Everything has happened quickly and I just want to make sure that, first and foremost, we stay in this league.“When the summer comes,an opportunity arises to stay I will definitely consider it but there is a lot of work to be done between now and then.”He is confident by the end of the season Dundee will be safe.“It’s been really good so far. They are a great bunch of boys and they have made me feel really welcome in the dressing-room.“I’ve kicked most of them when I was playing here in seasons gone by so I know most of them.“There’s a good manager in Jim McIntyre to work under as well. I’m showing my age here but I’ve actually played against him when I was a young player on loan at Ayr from Hearts.“He was coming to the end of his career then and later I played against a couple of his teams once he’d become a manager.“I’m quite close with a couple of players who have played under him and they spoke highly of him and that was more of a factor in coming here.“Having played across the road I also knew how big a club Dundee is. It’s a good club, in a dficult position at the minute but definitely one we can get out of.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5d60e73d9760.05654911.jpg ","title":"george cran dundee have signed a fresh team but are these new men any good","story":"There’s a fresh look about Dundee these days after manager Jim McIntyre made sweeping changes to his squad over January.Eleven new players came in – enough to make up a whole new team – as the Dark Blues look for a way out of the relegation mire they’ve found themselves in.Ten of the  have already made their debuts and today the Tele will have a look at what they’ve shown and what might be to come.Seny DiengIt’s not all been plain sailing for the Swiss goalie after his mis-cued clearance led to Hamilton’s equaliser at the weekend but he’s been an assured presence overall between the sticks.On loan from QPR, the -year-old is still learning his trade but he’s made some vital stops already and commands his area well. Kicking could do with improving, however.James HorsfieldAnother loanee, -year-old Horsfield is eager for game time after not featuring much for Scunthorpe this season.The former Man City kid, who has trained under Pep Guardiola, Manuel Pellegrini and Patrick Vieira, has shown a steady start at right-back both with the ball and defensively.Ryan McGowanThe Australian international has slotted in no problem at all and immediately strengthened the Dundee backline.Two strong performances already at centre-back, once he gets more settled there’s more to come.Andrew DaviesThe former Ross County skipper hasn’t had much luck in his time at Dens, breaking his foot in his first bounce game after signing.Injuries have been a feature of his career but all reports of his time in the Highlands and down south suggest, when he’s fit, he’s a strong leader at the back.Andreas HadeniusNot much was known about the big Swede before he signed for the Dark Blues just over a fortnight ago.We still don’t know too much but he’s shown in his two starts so far that he’s a ball-winner in the middle of the park who keeps possession ticking over.Ethan RobsonParent club Sunderland rate this kid highly and Jim McIntyre admitted he was surprised to be able to get the midfielder in on loan.His debut at Hamilton on Saturday largely passed him by before picking up a groin issue that kept him out of the - draw at Kilmarnock.Once up to speed, the hope is Robson can begin to realise the potential plenty down south recognise.John O’SullivanAnother loanee largely unknown up here, O’Sullivan made a fleeting debut at New Douglas Park last weekend.Andy DalesThe winger has made an impressive start to le up here. His direct, pacy running has caused defences plenty of problems but his final ball looks certain to frustrate Dees.Exciting player, though, and an asset to the team.Scott WrightThe talented forward hasn’t been able to push his way into Derek McInnes’ first team at Aberdeen yet and has joined Dundee to prove himself at this level.He’s fast becoming a favourite at Dens after a super goal at Hamilton and an impressive first-half showing against Kilmarnock.Craig CurranA frontman Jim McIntyre knows very well from his time at Ross County, Curran has shown he’ll work tirelessly and keep defenders honest. A tidy knock-down for the opening goal against Killie, too. More of that and the Dark Blues will be happy.Andrew NelsonWe were told the young striker was raw but full of talent and he’s shown that already. Three goals in five appearances have rocketed him to second-top scorer already this season but even when not scoring he gives defences a real headache.Will need support but already looks a real find."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c618d7d5cf133.42034458.jpg ","title":"innocent dundee dad may take legal action after cops batter down his door and handcuff him","story":"A Lochee dad is considering legal action after police forced their way into his home and put him in handcuffs in a case of mistaken identity.Andrew Alexander, , was enjoying an evening in with his son Drew, , when police entered his Kirk Street house.Officers in riot gear “battered” his door in and said they had a warrant to arrest a man with the same name, in connection with alleged firearms offences.However, it soon emerged they were targeting the wrong person. vw, px\"  Mr Alexander has received an apology from Police Scotland since September’s incident – but is unhappy at how it was handled.He said: “It happened late on a Saturday night.“I heard them battering down the door.“The door hadn’t opened and I said I would open it for them.“There were eight officers, some of them in riot gear.“They came in and showed me a warrant to search the premises for suspected firearms.“It was quickly flashed in my face and it said that Andrew Alexander was concerned in firearms.“I was immediately put in handcuffs and my hands were placed behind my back.”Mr Alexander said it was the second time in eight years he had been mistaken for a criminal.He added: “My son was taken into another room while officers carried out a search of the premises.

It’s one that could leave Keyes and Dundee-based managing director, John Nelms, less than impressed,not surprised.They’ve previously stated the proposed increase in shareholding would have resulted in major tax benefits as they press ahead with the planned Camperdown move.As they informed members and the club of their decision, the society expressed the opinion they’re acting “in the best interests of the society as a whole”.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

Alan McConnell, , admitted the offence when he appeared in Ayr Sherf Court. McConnell was drinking at home with his partner on December  last year. But at some point he left the address, in Prestwick’s Raith Avenue, said depute fiscal Lindzi Bayne. His partner went looking for him at a nearby corner shop, but he had driven off so shop staff contacted police. McConnell’s car was traced to Drongan, and he admitted he had driven there. The charge against him stated he drove on roads between Raith Avenue, Prestwick and Coronation Road, Drongan. A breath test revealed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit in Scotland is  microgrammes. The court heard that McConnell had been ‘just over’ the limit in an earlier drink-driving conviction. Defence lawyer John Gallagher said his client was well aware he could be sent to jail this time. However, he made a plea for a sentence of unpaid work on his client, now of Lane Crescent, Drongan. Sherf John Montgomery told McConnell: “You were driving at five times over the prescribed limit. “If you ever offend again like this, it is inevitable you are going to jail.” He imposed a four-year-driving ban on McConnell, and ordered him to do  hours of unpaid work in the community, within six months.

Neighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Sherf John Montgomery told him: “That would normally mean a custodial sentence. I note your previously unblemished record.” The sherf instead imposed a fine of pound on Fairbairn, and banned him from driving for three years. Depute fiscal Lynda Carnochan described how an anonymous person phoned police on Tuesday afternoon, August , , around .pm. An hour later, police traced a blue Audi car to Rodney Drive in Girvan, and Fairbairn was still in the vehicle. His speech was slurred, said Ms Carnochan. But due to health problems, he struggled to give a breath test.   However, a blood test revealed he had  milligrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of blood, when the legal limit is  milligrammes. Just two months later, on October , , police on mobile patrol saw Fairbairn driving a Vauxhall Corsa. “They were aware of anonymous reports that he was driving while drinking,” said Ms Carnochan. “They followed him into The Avenue, but he did not stop when police flashed lights at him. He then turned into Rodney Drive, and drove past his own address. However he was eventually stopped.” A breath test was this time successful on Fairbairn. And iot showed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath when the legal limit is  microgrammes. Solicitor Hugh Duncan said Fairbairn had retired from the Bank of Scotland in  on a pension of pound per week.   He used his car to visit his -year-old mother, who is resident in a care home, added the lawyer. “The second matter, within such a short space of time, shows there is an issue with alcohol,” Mr Duncan admitted. “His we tells me his drinking is being curtailed. He was hospitalised with a gallstone, and he suffers from COPD.” Sherf Montgomery fined Fairbairn pound on the first charge, with a  months disqualication. He added an pound fine and a three-year disqualication on the second charge. Fairbairn, of Rodney Drive in Girvan, agreed to pay the pound total within  days. His disqualications will run concurrently, making a total of three years, but the Crown made no move to seize the family cars.

represent their regions.They are all donning their best headwear from beanies to cowboy hats, trilbies to Panamas, baseball caps to novelty headpieces, and are asking others to join them for Wear A Hat Day, which takes place on Friday, March .The event is expected to smash all records as it marks its th year.Chloe and Oscarrsquos dad Matt was diagnosed after collapsing at home with an aggressive and incurable glioblastoma multormebrain tumour.Despite undergoing surgery and chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment, Matt passed away less than two years later, aged , in March , not long after his th wedding anniversary.Mum Gill, a teaching secretary at Edinburgh College of Art, said: ldquoWhen Matt was diagnosed, we were told that the average le expectancy of this type of tumour was  to  months.\"The grieving process for me started  months before Matt died as the two of us came to terms with the idea that we were not going to have the le together we planned.\"I spent a lot of time listening to a playlist we compiled which represented our  years together.ldquoNow I am doing my best to give our children the childhood we had planned together.ldquoI am so proud of Oscar and Chloe for being part of the Wear A Hat Day campaign.\"It means so much to my family and me to help contribute towards a cure, so itrsquos an honour to have them take part. Chloe and Oscar had such a fun time at the photoshoot too and it will be a lovely memento for them to look back on.Wear A Hat Day also has the backing of supermodel, businesswoman and brain tumour survivor Caprice who underwent surgery to remove a meningioma brain tumour two years ago.A patron of Brain Tumour Research, Caprice plays a key role in raising awareness of the disease and campaigning for the government and the larger cancer charities to increase national investment in research.

Brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of  than any other cancer yet, historically, just one percent of the national spend on cancer research has been allocated to this devastating disease Brain Tumour Research is proud to be changing this.ldquoThe sad truth is that brain tumours are indiscriminate and can affect anyone at any age and this means the impact on families is enormous. Too many children are losing siblings, parents and grandparents, too many parents are enduring the agony of their childrsquos diagnosis, and society as a whole continues to bear the burden of increased costs through the NHS, lost taxes, and demands on the benefits system.Wear A Hat Day has raised over a million pounds since the launch of Brain Tumour Research  years ago.The big day will see schools, workplaces, families and iniduals across the UK fundraising and taking part in fun events to raise awareness of brain tumours and help fund le-saving research.Funds raised will develop

deal ratied in time for the UK to leave the EU on March .The Prime Minister told MPs that she would enable the House of Commons to lt a requirement for a -day delay before any vote to approve an international treaty.But Labour pledged to oppose the move, accusing the Government of showing ldquocontempt for our democracy.The announcement came as Mrs May urged MPs to ldquohold their nerve and support her efforts to secure a withdrawal deal which will deliver Brexit on time.In a statement updating the Commons on progress in talks, Mrs May acknowledged she would need ldquosome time to seek legally-binding changes from the EU to the controversial backstop for the Irish border.She confirmed that she will table an amendable motion for debate on Thursday, seeking the Housersquos continued support for her to demand ldquoalternative arrangements to keep the border open after Brexit.And she pledged toon February  with a further statement ndash triggering another debate and votes the following day ndashshe has not secured a deal by that date.If a deal is agreed, MPs will have a second ldquomeaningful vote, like the one in January which saw Mrs Mayrsquos original plan rejected by a record-breaking  votes.The February  votes are expected to come shortly after Mrs Mayrsquos planned meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, at which changes or additions to the Withdrawal Agreement could be agreed.With  days to go, former attorney general Dominic Grieve warned that time was running perilously short for ratication of any deal under the terms of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act.The Act, passed by Gordon Brownrsquos administration in , requires  sitting days before the ratication of any international treaty.Dominic Grieve demanded to know how the PM could get her Brexit ratication bill through without extending the March  deadline But Mrs May responded: ldquoIn most circumstances, that period may be important in order for this House to have an opportunity to study that agreement.ldquoBut of course, in this instance MPs will already have debated and approved the agreement as part of the meaningful vote.ldquoSo while we will follow normal procedurewe can, where there is insufficient time remaining following a successful meaningful vote, we will make provision in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill ndash with Parliamentrsquos consent ndash to ensure that we are able to raty on time to guarantee our exit in an orderly way.PA GraphicsLabour Brexit spokesman Paul Blomfield said:ldquoThis plan shows contempt for our democracy.ldquoThe Government is trying to avoid proper scrutiny and run down the clock in order to force through its bad Brexit deal.ldquoLabour will oppose this change, which would deny Parliament full scrutiny.And Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said:ldquoMay will stop at nothing to crowbar through her botched Brexit deal eventhat means ripping up the statute book and subverting parliamentary scrutiny and process.ldquoThis cynical and undemocratic move must not be allowed to happen.But the PMrsquos official spokesman pointed out that by the time the -day period to consider the Brexit treaty kicked in, MPs would already have passed judgment on it in the ldquomeaningful vote and the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.ldquoItrsquos very hard to see a circumstance where having voted to pass the deal and then voted to enshrine its provisions in law, Parliament could hold up our exit in order to allow MPs to read the treaty, said the spokesman.The process would be accelerated by a clause in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill itself, which would disapply the terms of the  Act in this case, he said.Mrs May sidestepped demands from several MPs to spell out whether she would ask the EU for an extension to the two-year Brexit negotiation process or allow the UK to crash out without a dealshe hit the March  deadline with no agreement.In stormy exchanges in the Commons, the SNPrsquos Westminster leader Ian Blackford risked being thrown out of the chamber after shouting ldquoliar at the PM.And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn suggested the PM was ldquorunning down the clock on Brexit in the hope that MPs will be ldquoblackmailed by the fear of a no-deal outcome into supporting ldquoa deeply flawed deal.ldquoThis is an irresponsible act, said Mr Corbyn.ldquoShe is playing for time and playing with peoplersquos jobs, our economic security and the future of our industry.Mr Corbyn accused Mrs May of refusing to listen to his alternative deal, involving permanent customs union membership, a close alignment with the single market and matching EU workplace and environmental protections.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn listens to the PMrsquos statement But Mrs May insisted that she was listening to voices outside the Government, adding that ministers would have further talks with Labour on Wednesday on its list of five demandsit is to support a deal.She was heckled as she denied running down the clock, telling Mr Corbyn that she ldquowanted to have this sorted before Christmas.Labour MPs loudly retorted that she had pulled a ldquomeaningful vote in December because of fears she would lose.The PM told the Commons:ldquoWe now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House requires and deliver Brexit on time.ldquoBy getting the changes we need to the backstop by protecting and enhancing workersrsquo rights and environmental protections and by enhancing the role of

The board has certainly had a thorough look through it and as a matter of record we should appreciate it.#One thing that has caused frustration at previous meetings has been the dficulty in reading some of the financial papers.#This doesn’t change the overall picture, which is not a good one, but when you see it like this, it is easier.#The key things I take out will be the grip and control actions that the board are approving today.#As Kirsty says, this is not just a one-week wonder – this is a continuous process to help improve the financial position.#Although the outlook is not good there is a positive in that we have a better transparency and now that we have the grip and control we can look to move forward and see what dference it makes.#At the meeting, Ms Flanagan explained why an overspend is projected when the HSCP is currently operating at an underspend of just more than £,.The HSCP, run jointly by the council and NHS Highland, may face even further financial woean agreement is not reached with NHSGGC.Ms Flanagan said: #The finances within the dferent organisations are managed dferently. There is no right or wrong approach.#There has been a lower than budgeted demand for care home services. The focus of attention needs to be on the full year position, so reporting an overspend of £.m is a deterioration on where we were at our November meeting.#The main reason for this is dficulty in delivering over £m worth of savings. There also remains a risk to the out turn in the SLA with NHSGGC.#The board made the decision at the November meeting to reject the agreement and the overspend has been adjusted to reflect this.#If this position is not accepted by NHSGGC, the overspend could increase by up to £.m.#Cllr Mulvaney then proposed that a repayment plan from the HSCP to the council is deferred by a year.This involves the authority being repaid any loss made by the HSCP over a three-year period, with £, due in the first financial year, £, in the second financial year, and the balance in year three.Ms Flanagan said: #We should seek clarication but I think that would be a reasonable request.#It was also advised that a job description has been finalised for a permanent head of finance with the HSCP and should be advertised soon."},{"url":null,"title":"bus fare payments to go contactless","story":"Nearly half a million pounds has been awarded in the first round of the fund to help firms cope with the costs of upgrading ticket machines to accept contactless bank payments.The cash has been awarded from the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund.It is estimated to provide a contactless payment solution to potentially . million fare paying journeys right across Scotland.The fund builds on the successful rollout of contactless payment by the country’s largest operators and responds to feedback from smaller operators around the financial barriers to upgrading.The Scottish Government’s vision is that all journeys on Scotland’s public transport networks can be made using some form of smart ticketing or payment by spring .Commenting on the first awards, cabinet secretary for transport, Michael Matheson said: #Contactless payments make it easier to access travel in Scotland and I am delighted we have been able to support up to  smaller operators in making the transition to this convenient payment solution.#This government is committed to supporting the industry and also people right across the country who choose to travel by bus.#By helping smaller operators with the financial costs of upgrading to contactless payment, customers will benefit from quicker and easier transactions, whether by card or by mobile phone.#A second round of the fund hasl opened and we are widening this fund out to all operators, so that even more organisations can take advantage of the support on offer.#Keith Shand, Assistant Operations Manager at Garelochhead Mini Bus and Coaches, said: #Modern day society expects to board a bus and not have to carry the correct change.#Feedback from our customers shows  per cent have indicated they would use contactless payments on our buses and we’re delighted that we will now be able to deliver this service.#The Courier emailed West Coast Motors for a comment but no-one responded."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files february 8 2019","story":"Natasha turns up the heatAlthough narrowly beaten in the Highlands and Islands regional final, Natasha Lee impressed a  of hospitality judges in Inverness.The Campbeltown Grammar School pupil, aged , beat off stf competition to win a place at Inverness for the UK-wide Springboard FutureChef  cookery competition.Natasha with her certicate and regional finalist plate.

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Dominic Grieve warned that time was running perilously short for ratication of any deal under the terms of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act.The Act, passed by Gordon Brownrsquos administration in , requires  sitting days before the ratication of any international treaty.But Mrs May responded: ldquoIn most circumstances, that period may be important in order for this House to

accept  Corbyn has made Theresa May an offer she can   t refuse","story":"Last week, Corbyn made a remarkable overture to the Prime Minister. He effectively dropped his opposition to her Withdrawal Agreement, which Labour had repeatedly condemned as the ldquoworst of all worlds. The Labour leaderrsquos letter still calls for a customs union, regulatory alignment on trade and guarantees on workers rights and security cooperation. But, crucially, Labour is no longer holding to the ldquosix tests, and insisting a Brexit deal should deliver ldquoexactly the same benefits as being in the single market.Labour has even dropped its opposition to the Irish backstop, which Mr Corbyn condemned, as recently as December, for leaving Britain ldquoin an indefinite halfway house with no say on its future. The explanatory note that Labour circulated after the leaderrsquos letter to May is quite clear. ldquoAny withdrawal agreement,\" it says, ldquowill need to include a backstop.\" Labour is also hinting at further compromises in ldquonegotiations.Hitherto, Labourrsquos policy has been to make demands May could never accept now they are trying to make her an offer she canrsquot refuse.So at last, after months of there being nothing much new to say about Brexit, suddenly we have what looks like a breakthrough, a historic compromise. Of course, you canrsquot overestimate the ability of political leaders to look a gt horse in the mouth. Theresa May may be so wedded to being a ldquobloody dficult womanthat she may find a way to avoid accepting Labourrsquos free hooved mammal. But the deal is there to be made.Senior Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin have welcomed the Labour offer, seeing it as a step towards a Norway-style agreement, even though it isnrsquot. Labourrsquos plan is much closer to Turkey, which is also in a customs union and accepts regulatory alignment. Brussels likes Corbyns proposals too, as a way out of hard Brexit ldquohell.Ive argued that the logic of Labourrsquos position was always to back something resembling Theresa Mayrsquos deal with the EU. It corresponds to Labourrsquos manesto commitments to leaving the EU, including the single market, and ending free movement while seeking frictionless trade. Mrs May has always supported regulatory alignment, since the ldquocommon rule book in her Chequers plan. And the backstop, remember, involves the UK remaining in the customs union until there is a future comprehensive trade deal.In what could almost have been a coordinated intervention last week, Mrs May restated in Dublin her determination to prevent a hard border in Ireland. This put the wind up the DUP, since they fear that the border might now move to the Irish Sea.It didnrsquot appeal to the hardline Brexiteers in her own party either, who are adamant that no deal is better than her bad deal. They thought it had been killed off by last monthrsquos record-breaking Commons defeat ndash but it may now live again with Labourrsquos backing.They canrsquot admit it, of course, but May and Corbyn are now speaking broadly the same language. The customs union, regulatory alignment, rights and protections etc are all matters to do with the future trade relationship with the EU, not the Withdrawal Agreement. It covers only money, citizenship and the Good Friday Agreement.The trading relationship can only be negotiated after Brexit. It is to be hammered out within the up to four years of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union.Onlythere is no agreement does the backstop comes into play, and that really just extends the transition period indefinitely. May has said she will get assurances that the backstop will be time-limited, but she canrsquot get that from the European Union. If it was limited, it would no longer be a backstop.What hard Brexiteers really fear is that the transition period might lead to a soft Brexit, not a clean break ndash and they are right. What we know is that MPs will block any no-deal Brexit. Hardliners face a choice of May Corbyn or no Brexit at all.To secure a Commons majority without them, Mrs May could promise legislation to keep Britain in regulatory alignment with the customs union until a new trade deal is finalised ndash one which delivers the same benefits. This is anyway implicit in her promises to keep trade ldquofrictionless. Indeed, remaining in a customs union is the only way of achieving this. Up to now, she hasnrsquot been able to say this openly for fear of a rebellion by her hardline backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. They want a managed no-deal now, or in four years, under the so-called ldquoMalthouse Plan.Butshe has an ounce of political sense, May will now face them down and pivot to Labourrsquos softish Brexit. Labourrsquos demand that she put the customs union in primary legislation can be finessed, because the trade negotiations canrsquot happen until after Brexit. She doesnrsquot even need to ensure that Labour votes with her. Labour could abstain in the meaningful vote and achieve essentially the same result. The DUP would accept the customs union as a guarantee against a backstop or an east west hard border.Jeremy Corbyn could explain Labourrsquos abstention, which will be attacked by Vote Leave MPs andleader writers, by saying, as his spokespeople did last week: that the top priority ldquofor the nation is to avoid a no-deal. Corbynite commentators can be relied upon to condemn any Labour MPs who continue to vote against Mayrsquos deal as traitors. Unreconstructed Blairites, voting with the hated Moggists to force a no-deal disaster.Corbynrsquos letter made no reference to a Peoples Vote. Remainers in the Labour Party realise where all this is heading, which is why a number, like former shadow cabinet figures like Owen Smith, and Clive Lewis, have threatened to leave the party. That could become part of the script.Corbyn has used the Brexit issue to smoke out Blairite Remainers like Chuka Umunna, and the Jewish MP, Luciana Berger, in order to portray them as disloyal splitters.Of course, ordinary members of the Labour Party will be mightily confused. Many of them still think Labour is committed to a referendum. It still could come to that, of course,May doesnrsquot seize this opportunity.I still harbour vague hopes that A could be revoked, but Irsquom afraid that pro-Europeans are on the wrong side of history right now. The country is destined to leave the EU, because letrsquos face it, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is and has always been a pro-Brexit party.And after Brexit Day  Well, get ready for Groundhog Day  as negotiations over the future EU trade deal begin all over again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9413025.jpg?type=article-full","title":"call-to-cash-in-on-the-harry-potter-railway","story":"Famed for its spellbinding scenery and the iconic Glenfinnan viaduct, the West Highland Railway has become an international tourist attraction after doubling for the route taken by the Hogwarts Express in the film adaptation of JK Rowlings novels.Now Scotrail is being urged to cash in on the soaring numbers of passengers on the line, which runs from Glasgow to Fort William and onto Mallaig, by putting on extra services and providing a better experience for tourists.And a fresh injection of funds could also be magic for those travelling the A by easing congestion on the road to the Isles.Fresh figures published by the Office of Rail Regulation have revealed that the number of people travelling on the \"Harry Potter\" railway has doubled in the past decade, while hundreds are travelling to the countryside nearby to watch the train as it crosses the bridge.And the line - previously been hailed as one of the most scenic in the world - continues to be a runaway success, with the latest statistics show that the number of passengers passing through Fort William station growing by ,between  and last year.:Police issue warning to viaduct touristsThe numbers arriving at Glenfinnan station follow a similar track, rising by almost , while those reaching Mallaig are up by , or  per cent.Annual passenger numbers have increased by almost , passengers across the area, with growth at other towns such as Aviemore, Dingwall and Kyle of Lochalsh also appearing in the figures.Kate Forbes, MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituency, believes that now is the time to capitalise on the popularity of the enchanting route.She said: ldquoItrsquos fantastic to see more people choosing to go on the lsquoHarry Potter linersquo and experience the fantastic scenery at the Glenfinnan viaduct, as well as the breath-taking views from Fort William to Mallaig generally.ldquoUltimately, I would like to see more people using public transport instead of driving as it reduces congestion and its good for the environment.

That someone should be a member of the audience on dferent occasions should surprise no one, as the main concern of the producers is viewing figures, and these are boosted by having controversy, not by providing information.On the issue of bias, it is, sadly, there and seems part of the ethos of the programme. On Question Time a few days before the EU referendum, both David Dimbleby and Chris Grayling were out of their chairs to correct a lady who referred to \"English values\", pointing out that the said values were in reality \"British\". This political correctness did not long survive the vote, and not one on the  a few weeks later corrected an audience member who referred to \"English industry and trade\".Having watched the decline in standards over the past  months, I have decided not to waste my time watching Question Time. If I want to hear a reasoned and intelligent political discussion, I will ask a group of teenagers their opinion.T J Dowds,q Fleming Road, Cumbernauld.I NOTE with interest Mark Smiths article. I have thought for some time that Question Time has lost its way and that we no longer are presented with considered debate from reasonably informed members of the public. It seems to be a perpetual shouting joust from hand-picked members of the public. Last weeks episode was the prime example, no proper debate. I find now, and have done for some time, that I can only tolerate about half the programme before retiring with a good work of fiction.On Thursday evening the five members of the audience who were invited to participate, before I switched off and went to bed, were all vehemently opposed to the SNP, including as Mr Smith pointed, out one who was a Ukip member of the Orange Lodge, entitled to his opinion, however unchallenged in the \"debate\".In his last few years I felt David Dimbleby had lost control and Fiona Bruce, his replacement, whom I admire as a newsreader and presenter, lacks the incisive qualities of, for example, Emily Maitlis, who has proved on Newsnight she has the ability.The same  participants also seem to appear every few weeks asthe BBC has a limited pool of participants. Time for the BBC to review where this once-great programme is heading, or has the Brexit issue finally brought it to the point of no recovery Wallace Milligan, Juniper Green, Masonhill, Ayr.MARK Smithrsquos assessment of the BBCrsquos Question Time in Motherwell was charitable indeed. He gives the BBC the benefit of the doubt after allowing a known Ukip activist his fourth opportunity to shout at the SNP on the programme. This love-in between the BBC and Ukip has been longstanding, given the number of appearances Nigel Farage has had on the programme in recent years.The continued and sustained lack of SNP politicians appearing despite being the third largest party at Westminster compares badly with the treatment of the Liberal Democrats when they were in an identical parliamentary position. The truth is that the BBC has failed in its service to Scotland. The pound million Scotlandrsquos licence fee payers send south should instead be used to fund a new BBC Scotland, with complete editorial independence from the BBC in London. Before anyone complains that this would provide a poor service given a budget of this size, please be aware that Irelandrsquos BBC, which is known as RTE, spent eurom Ein .The New BBC Scotland would have at least the same spending power as RTE.Francis Buchan, Drybrough Crescent, Edinburgh.LAST Thursday on BBC Question Time from Motherwell, a serial audience member, former Ukip candidate Billy Mitchell, popped up in his favourite orange jerkin for his fourth appearance in so many years. This is a breach of the QT rules. A stooshie ensued on social media.

However a wee bit of googling would have alerted him to the fact that Mr Mitchell is a supporter of Ulster Young Militants, and calls himself \"orange jacket man\" on Facebook. So I donrsquot think itrsquos unreasonable to assume that his choice of jacket was a self-conscious sartorial nod.Why does it all matter  Well because Question Time producers say they have clear rules be up front about who you are when you apply to be on the programme, no repeat audience appearances, and politicians arenrsquot allowed to take cover in the audience ndash their place is on the  where they can be identied and their views subjected to scrutiny.

It says that playing loud music in public places amounts to a violation of human rights.Quiet Scotland has designed a set of feedback cards that allow customers to rate cafes, restaurants and bars on the loudness of their music.The cards are available from the group on request, and it hopes that they will persuade cafe owners and retailers to turn the music off. It also suggests that the grouprsquos followers contact the managers or owners of businesses to complain about the loudness of music.The pub chain Wetherspoons has already banned background music in its branches, and some supermarkets have introduced ldquoquiet hours where their music is switched off.Discount retailers Aldi and Lidl do not play any music in their branches.The Herald tested six venues in Glasgow with a decibel meter and found that one store ndash JD Sports ndash had music in its branch as loud as  decibels, which is as loud as a lawnmower. Its average was  decibels.By law, workers exposed to average noise levels of more than  decibels must be provided with ear protection.The Nike sports shop, which plays music in its branches, measured  on the decibel meter. Branches of Starbucks and Pizza Hut in the town centre, meanwhile, measured  and  decibels respectively.The Counting House Wetherspoons on George Square in Glasgow ndashwhich doesnrsquot play music ndash measured  decibels, the quietest venue tested.Quiet Scotlandrsquos treasurer, Anne Wellman, , said while the group began as an offshoot of Pipedown in England, they changed its name because ldquopiped music has a dferent meaning in Scotland.ldquoWe changed it to Quiet Scotland, because everybody who joined intensely dislikes background music played in public places, she said.ldquoSometimes thatrsquos because of health conditions, but in many cases itrsquos merely because we dislike having music imposed upon us.ldquoIn most cases, the music that shops and cafes play is unlikely to be popular with customers, she said. ldquoThink of the types of music you donrsquot like, and then have that blasted at you when yoursquore trying to eat. Because thatrsquos mostly the case.ldquoWhat are the odds of them playing something you actually like ldquoIt is very distressing for people who have a medical condition like autism or tinnitus or any hearing problems.She also suggested that disability legislation designed to protect those with medical conditions from discrimination could be applied to the loudness of music in public places.ldquoIt can actually affect your health and put you off going into shops and restaurants, she said.ldquoFor a lot of people, itrsquos simply annoying, but annoying to the point of refusing to patronise thoseshops.ldquoWe have about  members and we have a Facebook and Twitter presence which is gaining followers.ldquoI would make a comparison with the anti-smoking campaign. There was a point at which that was laughed at, and then it reached a tipping point when people actually started to agree.ldquoWe do see it as a transgression of a human right.The group also claims that rather than attracting more customers, loud background music can drive sales away, with customers preferring to shop online or in quieter places.Even pubs that choose not to playmusic can have televisions or gambling machines that make conversation dficult, it says.Background music has drawn the attention of celebrities, including Joanna Lumley, Stephen Fry and Roger Scruton, the conservative intellectual."},{"url":null,"title":"st-mirren-vow-to-find-and-ban-fans-who-spat-at-unconscious-supporter","story":"Buddies chiefs have hit out at the \"completely and utterly unacceptable\" behaviour of a small group of fans on Saturday.The United supporter was injured while celebrating one of the Ladbrokes Championship outfits goals during their - win in Paisley.But in a statement posted on the Saints website, club officials claim he was targeted by a section of the home support as he was being led away for treatment.Read more:Police Scotland accused of trying to turn young football fans into paid informants\"On Saturday a Dundee Utd supporter suffered a serious head injury after the away crowd surged forward after Uniteds first goal,\" the statement said. \"This is something we have warned our own support against on numerous occasions so hopefully this will make people realise how dangerous this can be.\"Given the seriousness of the injury the decision was taken to remove the fan by the quickest means possible which was through the vomitory at W.\"While the unconscious supporter was being removed there were numerous people standing above the vomitory who decided to spit and throw coins at him.\"This is completely and utterly unacceptable.

months, following a fire in the old building back in .Temporary accommodation on site was made for the nursery children.The new library space at Kinellar SchoolThe new school is built on the same site as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime.

As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

I believe it is essential that in navigating our way beyond the outcomes, we must plot a course to bring some stability.In those referendums, I campaigned for Scotland to remain in the UK and for the UK to remain in the EU. But I did not campaign for the status quo. I do think the relationship between the nations of the UK is imbalanced and I do want to see the end of Tory rule from Westminster.It will come as no surprise that I believe to my core that the best way to get rid of the Tories is to elect a Labour Government with Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister, investing in our communities and our industries again. Despite its obvious challenges, we do have an opportunity after Brexit to build that progressive society. Austerity is not inevitable, the status quo is not inevitable, we write the future ourselves.The other consequence of Brexit is that it requires us to re-examine where power lies within the UK, and rebalance it so that Scotland becomes more of an equal partner. And we need to be able to discuss and debate these issues in an intelligent and informed way. One of the more frustrating aspects of the debates around independence and Brexit is how narrow they are ideas for more radical models of how our society could be organised are pushed to the side.As so often in politics, it is those who hold the most extreme views, and shout the loudest, who dominate the political and media landscape. There are some for whom the answer to every question is independence, just as there were those whose answer to everything was to leave the European Union. The dominance of these voices has made it harder to make actual, serious progress.But at the heart of each lies a desire to take back control, and that is an impulse I understand. As a democratic socialist, I more than appreciate the drive and necessity to challenge power and authority. But I do not want the Labour Party to take power for its own sake, I want to take power so that we can give it away – to people in our communities. Because after a decade of austerity, our communities do not just need investment, they need more control and they need greater stability.: Brian Monteith: Brexit plan or no Brexit plan, the EU has always been a bullyWhether you voted Yes or No to independence, or Leave or Remain in the EU referendum, it is the right thing to do to ask how we can keep these sides together. It suits some to foster ision, and therefore they find it easy to say we should abandon one side or the other. But that is not Labour’s way of doing things, and it is not my approach either. We are talking about neighbours, friends, family members. We have to find ways to unite our communities, not more ways of iding them.After all, the real ision in our society is not between Scotland and England, it is between those who own the wealth and those who through their hard work create the wealth. That is the real ision. Children living in poverty in Dundee are held back in exactly the same way as children living in poverty in Derby.So we have to redistribute wealth, and power too. There is still a restlessness in Scotland about our place in the UK. The people of Scotland said no to independence in . But, as we discuss the future, that does not mean the only choices open to us are independence or carry on as we are.After Brexit, powers that were previously held in Europe are going toto the UK. Powers over the environment, over agriculture, state aid, fishing, public procurement. We need to ensure that when those powers come back from Brussels, that they do not go to London, they come here.: Ian Blackford calls on Scottish Labour MPs to reject May’s Brexit dealWe have had devolution since . There are many in the Tory Government, and in the senior ranks of the civil service too, who seem to have forgotten that. I wrote in this newspaper in January about how we in Scotland need to recapture that spirit of ambition and hope that marked the establishment of the Scottish Parliament  years ago. There are powers we have now that we do not fully utilise.The restlessness that many people feel here in Scotland exists in parts of England too. There is a genuine sense of grievance that London – perhaps more specically, the financial City of London – wields too much power and influence, at the expense of other towns and cities.As we negotiate our path beyond Brexit, we need answers to these questions that do not keep taking us back to the same old arguments and the same old isions.I believe that people are looking for real change and real democracy. That means real change in the balance of power where they work and where they live, and not simply the transfer of power from one Parliament, and one set of politicians, to another. Brexit calls for us to look afresh at the constitutional nature of the UK. A more federal Britain, locking in and strengthening devolution, and redistributing power so that it is not concentrated but dispersed, and so shared and utilised by the people for the people.To do this, we will be required to think beyond the comfort of traditional thought and speak beyond the refuge of soundbites – not always easy for politicians to do, especially in the age of -hour news. But we have to ask and answer the questions about how our society is run and why, about how our political and economic system is run and in whose interests, about how we protect our environment and how we treat each other as human beings. These are big questions and big challenges, but they are the very fundamental questions and challenges that the Labour Party was established to meet.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"as economy falters theresa may faces mps to ask them not to delay brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May will go before MPs today to face down calls for a delay to Brexit, amid growing unease at the impact on the economy from continued uncertainty.The Prime Minister will urge MPs to ‘hold our nerve’ before the Commons is presented with another “neutral motion” on Brexit later this week, rather than a substantive vote to approve the Brexit deal.It comes as the latest set of economic figures for the UK showed the slowest growth since , when the country was in recession.The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product growth fell to . per cent between October and December , driven by a . per cent drop in manufacturing output.In her statement to parliament, Mrs May is expected to say: “The talks are at a crucial stage. We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House has required and deliver Brexit on time.”Cabinet will meet this morning, with Downing Street hoping it has seen off any immediate risk of resignations over the looming prospect of a no-deal Brexit by promising a further round of Brexit votes at the end of February,Mrs May still hasn’t achieved the renegotiated deal she is calling for from Brussels. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said she would address MPs a day earlier than expected to give MPs more time to “digest the content” ahead of a series of votes scheduled for Thursday, allowing parliamentarians another chance to alter the course of Brexit or seek a delay.Following an exchange of letters between Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn, opening the door to further talks on a possible Brexit compromise, Downing Street said the government was not considering full membership of the EU customs union as demanded by the Labour leader.The demand is likely to be pushed to a vote on Thursday. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer denied reports that Mr Corbyn’s office removed a reference in the letter to a second EU referendum without his knowledge.“The letter was an agreed letter that was sent out,” Sir Keir said.“The critical question is: is she, in her response, indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not  And that’s what needs to be tested sooner rather than later.”Mrs May also came under fresh pressure from her own side not to compromise, with International Trade Secretary Liam Fox saying Labour’s proposals were “not workable”, while Boris Johnson claimed they would produce a “toxic” Brexit.Mr Johnson suggested he could back the Brexit dealit included a time limit and unilateral exit mechanism from the Irish border backstop, but the former foreign secretary warned putting the changes in a codicil to the withdrawal agreement would not be good enough.Meanwhile, a group of anti-Brexit Conservative MPs and peers have written to the Prime Minister asking for a meeting to discuss the UK’s exit being delayed.In their letter to Mrs May, the group describing themselves as “patriotic, pragmatic Conservatives” said it the UK is “not ready to leave” on the scheduled date of  March.The Right to Vote group includes former attorney general Dominic Grieve and ex-ministers Phillip Lee, Sam Gyimah and Guto Bebb who quit the government to fight for a second referendum.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"derek mackay spends almost 1000 on public speaking refresher course","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Finance Secretary Derek Mackay spent almost # of taxpayers cash on a \"refresher course\" in public speaking, it has emerged.The money went to Glasgow-based firm voicebusiness which boasts it can turn \"nervous wrecks into skilled presenters.\"Read more: Derek Mackay hits out at ‘scaremongering’ over car tax planMr Mackay was among a clutch of Scottish ministers who received refresher training in the past year.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-ROADS-1.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J.

Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

In  an offer was put in to purchase the former pub, and in September last year they finally moved in to the charity’s new home and began renovations to turn the building into a community facility.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.To move or not to move  That is the Brexit question Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project. We have a team here that have a passion to serve this community, to walk in unity with them and see change happen.”• About the charity and its work...Founded in  by Gail Redmond, Via Wings was set up to help people in need in Dromore and surrounding areas.The faith-based charity’s aim “is to show God’s love in a loving, caring, practical, non-judgemental way.”It runs a range of projects designed to tackle problems such as poverty, loneliness, isolation, deprivation and more.

It would take a great team to beat his Naomh Éanna side in Championship football this season. On Saturday night, they went toe-to-toe with a fine Kilcummin outfit and came off second best as the Kerry men ran out emphatic -point victors.Central to Kilcummin’s success was the scintillating performance of Kevin McCarthy # who scored a remarkable -, all from play.As his team made their way off the pitch to a remarkable ovation from their large travelling support, the Naomh Éanna boss praised their efforts after a long season which still yielded two Championship titles.“We said coming down here we could live with playing our best and getting beat by a better team. I don’t think we played our best, but we were beaten by a better team,” said Fitzsimons.“Their goalkeeperpulled off two or three great saves and you need to be getting those scores at this level.“They are a super team. I said to the boys at half-time that we were still on the bus. This is a very young side # Eoin Nagle is only  and he was as good as anyone.“There is a bright future in front of those boysthey all stick together and continue to work the way they have been.”In truth, the North Belfast men never really recovered from a nightmare start which saw them concede - inside the first eight minutes with Matt Keane and McCarthy finding the target.A stunning goal from Eoin Nagle kick-started Naomh Éanna’s challenge following a couple of good points from Odhran Eastwood and a Ruairi Scott major on  minutes left just two points between the sides.However, their good work was swtly undone at the other end in a counter attack which halted their progress.Goalkeeper Paddy Flood fouled Noel Duggan as the corner-forward was bearing down on goal following a great pass inside from Seán O’Leary. Referee James Molloy awarded the penalty and issued a black card to Flood for the take-down.To add insult to injury, defender Conor McAuley picked up an ankle ligament injury in the goalmouth scramble which ended his evening.With substitute ’keeper Conor Devlin unavailable due to his soccer commitments with Larne, Michael Morgan donned the number one jersey for the remainder of the contest, but, following a y stoppage, he couldn’t prevent Kieran Murphy from scoring the penalty.With Kilcummin moving into a - to - lead at the break, the Antrim and Ulster champions needed a fast start to the second half, yet an unanswered salvo of - put the game firmly beyond Naomh Éanna. Former Kerry goalkeeper Brendan Kealy pulled off a smart save to deny Kristian Healy early in the half, but current Kingdom ist McCarthy stole the show with some majestic scores.He dovetailed well with the industrious Noel Duggan while Murphy and centre-back Chris O’Leary pushed forward with abandon. As Naomh Éanna continued to chase the game, their defence was exposed.When Healy tested Kealy’s reflexes once again midway through the half, Kilcummin went straight down to the Davin Stand side and with McCarthy splitting the posts in ruthless fashion.With less than  minutes remaining, Kilcummin bagged their fourth major with McCarthy applying the finish following a wonderful move involving Shane McSweeey and Gary O’Leary with McCarthy turning past the advancing Morgan in the Naomh Éanna goal before driving the ball into the net.In injury-time, he completed his hat-trick with his easiest finish of the night after being left unmarked in front of goal to round off a brilliant inidual display.It wasn’t to be for Naomh Éanna, but they’ll quickly turn their attentions to the new season and tonight’s Antrim Championship draws when they will learn who there opponents will be when they make their Senior Football Championship debut later this year.

The events have become known as the Ballymurphy Massacre.Mr Clarke was shot on an area of waste ground close to Springfield Park known as the field on the evening of August .He had been at work that day and as he ed home, he heard there had been disturbances in the area all day. He evacuated his we and two young children before ing to protect his house.Upon his , he told the inquest he saw women who were hysterical and he suggested moving people to nearby New Barnsley.He delivered a baby to safety and was making his way back across the field to help others when he described believing that two soldiers sitting on a roof of flats in the Springmartin road were tracking him with their rles, he had started to zigzag to become a “harder target” when he was hit in the back by a bullet and fell to the ground.Father Hugh Mullan crawled to him, waving a white cloth, and offered to administer the Last Rites.“He said ‘I’ll anoint you’, I said ‘Father, I am not going to die’, he said ‘I’ll anoint you, it will strengthen you’,” Mr Clarke told the inquest.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The  victims of the Ballymurphy Massacre He said that Fr Mullan told him he was going to call an ambulance for him, but after just a few steps he was struck by a bullet and fell to the ground where he was hit with a second bullet.Another man, Frank Quinn, , was also shot dead.He said he and his brother Gerald later “slid” over to longer grass close to Finlay’s Factory and lay for hours before they felt safe to move.“We were trapped there until it was dark enough to get out,” he added.Mr Clarke said he believes he was shot by soldiers who were at ground level on Springfield Park, and that they were members of the Parachute Regiment, based on his wound that he described as “horizontal”.He told the inquest he has had  years of “living this”, and holds himself responsible for the deaths of the two men.“Two people lost their lives coming to help me while I was trying to help those who could not help themselves,” he said.“That’s a very heavy burden to have.”He also told the inquest that he gave a statement about Fr Mullan’s death to a police sergeant at the Henry Taggart base.

Fair Head would be popular with climbers so I have seen the professionals and this was not it,\" he continued.\"Its madness. Had they fallen its the Atlantic Ocean. They wouldnt last long and theyd likely hit a rock on the way down.\"Theres been a lot of snow and rain over the past week and the grass is just sitting there so you put weight on it and its away from under you.\"Its a dangerous spot as its dficult for the leboat to get to so most likely they would have to wait on the Coastguard helicopter and that can be a  minute wait. And then those resources are tied upsomeone  gets into dficulty.He added: \"We all make mistakes - but this is just madness and so irresponsible. They clearly dont think anything of themselves or those that would put their lives at risk in trying to save them.\"Causeway Coast and Glens UUP Councillor Joan Baird, who lives close to the location, said she was shocked and called on those to desist.\"Just consider those that would, without thought, risk their lives to come out to rescue youyou get into dficulty,\" she said.\"I am not against climbing so long as they wear the right safety gear and are trained. But this does not look to be the case.\"Over the summer there would nearly be daily call outs. I was out walking today and there were paths that I felt were not safe to walk on given the amount of slippage we have had after the snow last week. The surfaces are in poor condition and very dficult.\"I would call for those doing this to stop.\"Ryan Gray Senior Maritime Operations Officer for HM Coastguard added: \"The recent photos taken at Ballycastle are concerning, we want people to enjoy themselves at the coast by making sure their visit is one to remember and not one they’d rather forget.\"We strongly recommend you do not attempt to climb up or down clfs unless you are properly equipped and trained to do so, and don’t attempt to climb clfs as a short cut. If unequipped for a climb it only takes one slip or a loose rock for it to end in tragedy. Remember,you think someone might be in trouble along the coast or out at sea please call  and ask for the Coastguard.\""},{"url":null,"title":"unionism could be energetic voice in united ireland debate sinn fein chief","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

circuit parliamentary rules in order to get a Brexit deal ratied in time for the UK to leave the EU on March ..pushThe Prime Minister told MPs that she would enable the House of Commons to lt a requirement for a -day delay before any vote to approve an international treaty.But Labour pledged to oppose the move, accusing the Government of showing “contempt for our democracy”.The announcement came as Mrs May urged MPs to “hold their nerve” and support her efforts to secure a withdrawal deal which will deliver Brexit on time.In a statement updating the Commons on progress in talks, Mrs May acknowledged she would need “some time” to seek legally-binding changes from the EU to the controversial backstop for the Irish border.We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House requires and deliver Brexit on timeTheresa MayFacebookTwitterShe confirmed that she will table an amendable motion for debate on Thursday, seeking the House’s continued support for her to demand “alternative arrangements” to keep the border open after Brexit.And she pledged toon February  with a further statement – triggering another debate and votes the following day –she has not secured a deal by that date.If a deal is agreed, MPs will have a second “meaningful vote”, like the one in January which saw Mrs May’s original plan rejected by a record-breaking  votes.The February  votes are expected to come shortly after Mrs May’s planned meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, at which changes or additions to the Withdrawal Agreement could be agreed.With  days to go, former attorney general Dominic Grieve warned that time was running perilously short for ratication of any deal under the terms of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act.The Act, passed by Gordon Brown’s administration in , requires  sitting days before the ratication of any international treaty.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Former attorney general Dominic Grieve demanded to know how the PM could get her Brexit ratication bill through without extending the March  deadline But Mrs May responded:  “In most circumstances, that period may be important in order for this House to have an opportunity to study that agreement.“But of course, in this instance MPs will already have debated and approved the agreement as part of the meaningful vote.“So while we will follow normal procedurewe can, where there is insufficient time remaining following a successful meaningful vote, we will make provision in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill – with Parliament’s consent – to ensure that we are able to raty on time to guarantee our exit in an orderly way.”PA GraphicsLabour Brexit spokesman Paul Blomfield said: “This plan shows contempt for our democracy. “The Government is trying to avoid proper scrutiny and run down the clock in order to force through its bad Brexit deal.“Labour will oppose this change, which would deny Parliament full scrutiny.”And Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said: “May will stop at nothing to crowbar through her botched Brexit deal eventhat means ripping up the statute book and subverting parliamentary scrutiny and process.“This cynical and undemocratic move must not be allowed to happen.”But the PM’s official spokesman pointed out that by the time the -day period to consider the Brexit treaty kicked in, MPs would already have passed judgment on it in the “meaningful vote” and the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.“It’s very hard to see a circumstance where having voted to pass the deal and then voted to enshrine its provisions in law, Parliament could hold up our exit in order to allow MPs to read the treaty,” said the spokesman.The process would be accelerated by a clause in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill itself, which would disapply the terms of the  Act in this case, he said.Mrs May sidestepped demands from several MPs to spell out whether she would ask the EU for an extension to the two-year Brexit negotiation process or allow the UK to crash out without a dealshe hit the March  deadline with no agreement.In stormy exchanges in the Commons, the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford risked being thrown out of the chamber after shouting “liar” at the PM.And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn suggested the PM was “running down the clock” on Brexit in the hope that MPs will be “blackmailed” by the fear of a no-deal outcome into supporting “a deeply flawed deal”.“This is an irresponsible act,” said Mr Corbyn.“She is playing for time and playing with people’s jobs, our economic security and the future of our industry.”Mr Corbyn accused Mrs May of refusing to listen to his alternative deal, involving permanent customs union membership, a close alignment with the single market and matching EU workplace and environmental protections.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn listens to the PM’s statement But Mrs May insisted that she was listening to voices outside the Government, adding that ministers would have further talks with Labour on Wednesday on its list of five demandsit is to support a deal.She was heckled as she denied running down the clock, telling Mr Corbyn that she “wanted to have this sorted before Christmas”.Labour MPs loudly retorted that she had pulled a “meaningful vote” in December because of fears she would lose.The PM told the Commons: “We now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House requires and deliver Brexit on time.“By getting the changes we need to the backstop by protecting and enhancing workers’ rights and environmental protections and by enhancing the role of Parliament in the next phase of negotiations I believe we can reach a deal that this House can support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tv star tells charles of comfort hospice provided over her mother","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

theatre facility in Newry City, the delivery of the Southern Relief Road and a -year programme of economic growth, the chief executive continued.ldquoThe reopening of the Warrenpoint Municipal Park in August and the opening of the Carlingford Lough Greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock in July demonstrate our councilrsquos commitment to improving our arearsquos attractions and environment.Mr Hannaway said that in the coming year Newry and its Cathedral Corridor would see pound, for improvements, festive lighting and events, to building on what has already been achieved in these locations.His focus also turned to Brexit, explaining that as the March  deadline for leaving edges ever closer, the councilrsquos relationships with government departments, the EU, cross border bodies and institutions across Ireland and Britain will become even more important as it seeks to improve the district.ldquoThese partnerships will remain a priority for the coming year as we deliver initiatives, programmes and services for all the people living, working and investing in our district, he continued.ldquoSome of the projects that will be progressed during the   year include further revitalisation of Warrenpoint, with pound, for town improvements, including shop fronts, new signage and a promotional and marketing campaign.ldquoThe council has also secured approval for the Ballynahinch bypass, a plan that will greatly improve access throughout the area and relieve the traffic congestion in the town centre.Mr Hannaway said plans for the southern relief road in Newry will be progressed after the preferred route was announced and was confident that developing a strategic link road between the A Dublin Road and the A Warrenpoint Road mdash a project that the council is

the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation. However, the family influence remains strong as in the case of siblings Jessica and Thomas Watson, whose great grandfather, David Stranney, was in the band, although their parents werenrsquot.But the members know that keeping the band going for the next generation is an even greater challenge today than it was  years ago.They are delighted that it currently has  members aged  and under in the band.Apart from marching in the annual Twelfth celebrations, the main activity for the band is performing at local concerts where it has raised more than pound, in recent years for charities.Sam Gill says that the next big push, once some of the younger members are ready for it, will be to start competing in contests again, although they know it may take some time to reach their former B grade.ldquoTherersquos still a hunger to try and get the band to be as good as possible. The problem we have mdash and any band will tell you the same mdash is trying to keep the young ones interested becauseyou donrsquot, they will leave, he added.ldquoBands like ours are often recruitment bands for other larger ones but we would dearly love to see more experienced band members joining Hollymount and passing on their experience to the next generation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Contractors continue with leisure centre demolition  ","story":"WORK is progressing at pace to demolish the old Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick.Contractors are razing the old building to the ground as its poundm replacement continues to break membership records, with additional staff drafted in to cope with the volume of people coming through the doors.Four decades after the old centre opened, it is being reduced to a pile of rubble as the soaraway success of its ultra-modern replacement continues, with users flocking in their droves and membership doubling within a week.The old centre was the first major leisure complex built in the district and was one of the most modern of its kind when the doors opened for business, boasting a new swimming pool and a suite of other facilities, including a large sports hall.Contractors in charge of the demolition began work shortly before Christmas and over the past few weeks have made signicant progress.The old sports hall has been razed to the ground with contractors currently using heavy equipment to demolish the old swimming pools and reception area.The old centre was a major community hub and in addition to meeting the districtrsquos leisure needs, the large hall hosted many community events including public rallies, former Down Council election counts, drama productions and even concerts featuring a host of local artists.While the centre had long since passed its sell-by-date, the former Down Council was keen to replace it and the work the local authority started was completed by its successor, Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The old centre closed for the final time at the end of November,  years after it opened. Within a week of its multi-million pound replacement opening for business, membership numbers doubled.The stunning new three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.Boasting ultra-modern equipment, the magnicent and futuristic , square metre centre heralds an exciting new dawn in the history of leisure provision across the district with facilities including an  station wellness gymnasium featuring the latest equipment.There is also a -station spin studio, -metre six-lane swimming pool, luxury vitality health suite including a sauna, steam room and vitality pool.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science.

The front door still has its peep hole and numerous locks, but the interior certainly does not resemble a station. The cells have become the kitchen and the remaining rooms have been completely renovated.Because of its similarity with other police stations the current owners have had several amusing incidents when people have called looking for directions, or asking for stray drunks to be locked up for the night.A spokesman for the estate agents agreed that it was one of the most unusual buildings to appear on the property market and added that it would suit anyone worried about security problems!NEWCASTLE mdash Provisional plans for Newcastlersquos summer fun programme mdash the centrepiece of Down Districtrsquos holiday entertainment mdash are already being drawn up.Newcastle Town Committee mdash the local body which co-ordinates the summer programme mdash held its annual convention last week and preparations for this yearrsquos programme got underway.Members of the town committee have pledged their determination to make this yearrsquos event even bigger and better than before.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

He has no doubt that they will be relieved to hear that the scheme is definitely going ahead.He continued: ldquoI had wanted an extra filter lane to be provided, but due to the extensive underground utilities, the cost to relocate them would have delayed the installation of the puffin crossings.ldquoIn the interests of public safety, it is essential to push on with the committed works to provide the new puffin crossings before the end of March.ldquoI would like to thank roads officials for listening to the concerns of the Newcastle community and delivering on this important road safety priority.Last year, a new plan to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout in response to mounting local concern was outlined.Roads officials plan to create a new dedicated filter lane, enabling drivers entering the resort from the Dundrum direction and wishing to access the Castlewellan Road to do so without causing major tailbacks, leaving two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the town centre.It is understood officials have not yet fully costed the scheme, but they have confirmed they will require to shave off a section of land at the side of the roundabout to provide the new link road which they are confident can signicantly reduce congestion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle trio are nice and Trim  ","story":"FOR those preparing for a Spring Marathon, the Trim  Mile Road Race is the first opportunity to see how January training has gone and the progress made towards achieving whatever your goal might be.This has been a popular event among the NAC faithful in the past and the bus full of lsquomaybesrsquo was reasonably full last year.This year, the event proved more popular than ever and sold out in early January.

He said the review will not be completed until December.Cllr Curran said Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie were at the heart of their respective communities and that new investment was required to allow them to develop.ldquoWhile I welcome the planned review, I am concerned at how long it will take to complete. In addition, how will any recommendations around future investment for example be implemented in the absence of a ing Stormont Assembly  he asked.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to make pound, to assist with plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour, helping secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry.The local authority is making the cash available to the recently formed Ardglass harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals to help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ardglass.The money has been earmarked to help the new group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17402917.ergs-students-could-move-to-devenish-site/resources/images/9395962.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

He was a model of consistency. He’d not be a nine out of  one week and a six the next. He was a nine every game.“All this was before there was any such thing as goalkeeping coaches. You learned through your mistakes.“His record spoke for itself. He was a World Cup winner in  and no one can forget that save he produced from Pele .”Jennings, who is NI’s most capped player with  caps, added: “I’ve known Gordon for a long time. I would consider him a friend. We’d done a fewdinners together and lined up against each other on a few occasions.”Northern Ireland goalkeeping legend Pat JenningsOne of those occasions was when England came to Windsor Park on May , . England won the game - but it will be remembered for the moment when a Best goal was disallowed after he had nicked the ball away from Banks as he threw it into the air to attempt a kick upfield.Jennings said: “The referee was right. You can’t have players sticking their foot up to challenge a goalkeeper. It’s dangerous play. Although George pulled it off that time, you would have other times when goalkeepers would have ended up with broken legs because strikers were sticking their legs out when they were trying to kick the ball.“The way George did it was brilliant. I think it was a couple of weeks later that George did the same thing on me for Manchester Unitedand the referee allowed it to stand.”Banks made  league appearances for Chesterfield, Leicester – with whom he won the League Cup in  – and Stoke before retiring from the professional game at the age of  following a road accident which cost him the sight in his right eye.It was on the international stage that he established himself as a star, making his England debut in a - defeat by Scotland at Wembley in April  and going on to win  senior caps, most famously in the - World Cup final victory over West Germany in .

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Mass arrests sparked rioting across the region.Over three days, from August -,  people died in shootings at a number of locations in west Belfast.The events have become known as the Ballymurphy Massacre.Mr Clarke was shot on an area of waste ground close to Springfield Park known as the field on the evening of August .He had been at work that day and as he ed home, he heard there had been disturbances in the area all day. He evacuated his we and two young children before ing to protect his house.Upon his , he told the inquest he saw women who were hysterical and he suggested moving people to nearby New Barnsley.He delivered a baby to safety and was making his way back across the field to help others when he described believing that two soldiers sitting on a roof of flats in the Springmartin road were tracking him with their rles, he had started to zigzag to become a ldquoharder target when he was hit in the back by a bullet and fell to the ground.Father Hugh Mullan crawled to him, waving a white cloth, and offered to administer the Last Rites.ldquoHe said lsquoIrsquoll anoint yoursquo, I said lsquoFather, I am not going to diersquo, he said lsquoIrsquoll anoint you, it will strengthen yoursquo, Mr Clarke told the inquest.The  victims of the Ballymurphy Massacre He said that Fr Mullan told him he was going to call an ambulance for him, but after just a few steps he was struck by a bullet and fell to the ground where he was hit with a second bullet.Another man, Frank Quinn, , was also shot dead.He said he and his brother Gerald later ldquoslid over to longer grass close to Finlayrsquos Factory and lay for hours before they felt safe to move.ldquoWe were trapped there until it was dark enough to get out, he added.Mr Clarke said he believes he was shot by soldiers who were at ground level on Springfield Park, and that they were members of the Parachute Regiment, based on his wound that he described as ldquohorizontal.He told the inquest he has had  years of ldquoliving this, and holds himself responsible for the deaths of the two men.ldquoTwo people lost their lives coming to help me while I was trying to help those who could not help themselves, he said.ldquoThatrsquos a very heavy burden to have.He also told the inquest that he gave a statement about Fr Mullanrsquos death to a police sergeant at the Henry Taggart base. That statement has not been traced.When that was put to him, he responded: ldquoI wouldnrsquot be surprised to tell you the truth, before adding ldquocover up when asked why.Mr Clarke said internment destroyed his street.ldquoSpringfield Park was a blueprint for Northern Ireland, Catholics and Protestants living in harmony, he said.ldquoOne night destroyed it. Internment.Earlier, the inquest heard another man who had been in the field during the shootings said he saw no gunmen in the area that evening other than three men he believed were soldiers, one of whom was armed with a rle.ldquoNo one who was on that field had any weapons, no one was a threat to anyone, and thatrsquos the Godrsquos honest truth, Francis Corr told the inquest.The inquest continues.Speaking outside court Mr Clarke said he feels relieved having given evidence to the inquest.ldquoI feel responsible for those who lost their lives coming to help me because I was only helping other people, I still feel responsible, he said.ldquoI feel relieved up to a point because I think I could have done more, itrsquos a terrible thing to have on your conscience these  years, two people died helping you.ldquoI live with that every day..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Belfast street was a blueprint for N Ireland, Ballymurphy inquest told article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

parliament by march ","story":"The Prime Minister told MPs that she would enable the House of Commons to lt a requirement for a -day delay before any vote to approve an international treaty.But Labour pledged to oppose the move, accusing the Government of showing ldquocontempt for our democracy.The announcement came as Mrs May urged MPs to ldquohold their nerve and support her efforts to secure a withdrawal deal which will deliver Brexit on time.In a statement updating the Commons on progress in talks, Mrs May acknowledged she would need ldquosome time to seek legally-binding changes from the EU to the controversial backstop for the Irish border.She confirmed that she will table an amendable motion for debate on Thursday, seeking the Housersquos continued support for her to demand ldquoalternative arrangements to keep the border open after Brexit.And she pledged toon February  with a further statement ndash triggering another debate and votes the following day ndashshe has not secured a deal by that date.If a deal is agreed, MPs will have a second ldquomeaningful vote, like the one in January which saw Mrs Mayrsquos original plan rejected by a record-breaking  votes.The February  votes are expected to come shortly after Mrs Mayrsquos planned meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, at which changes or additions to the Withdrawal Agreement could be agreed.With  days to go, former attorney general Dominic Grieve warned that time was running perilously short for ratication of any deal under the terms of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act.The Act, passed by Gordon Brownrsquos administration in , requires  sitting days before the ratication of any international treaty.Dominic Grieve demanded to know how the PM could get her Brexit ratication bill through without extending the March  deadline But Mrs May responded: ldquoIn most circumstances, that period may be important in order for this House to have an opportunity to study that agreement.ldquoBut of course, in this instance MPs will already have debated and approved the agreement as part of the meaningful vote.ldquoSo while we will follow normal procedurewe can, where there is insufficient time remaining following a successful meaningful vote, we will make provision in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill ndash with Parliamentrsquos consent ndash to ensure that we are able to raty on time to guarantee our exit in an orderly way.PA GraphicsLabour Brexit spokesman Paul Blomfield said:ldquoThis plan shows contempt for our democracy.ldquoThe Government is trying to avoid proper scrutiny and run down the clock in order to force through its bad Brexit deal.ldquoLabour will oppose this change, which would deny Parliament full scrutiny.And Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said:ldquoMay will stop at nothing to crowbar through her botched Brexit deal eventhat means ripping up the statute book and subverting parliamentary scrutiny and process.ldquoThis cynical and undemocratic move must not be allowed to happen.But the PMrsquos official spokesman pointed out that by the time the -day period to consider the Brexit treaty kicked in, MPs would already have passed judgment on it in the ldquomeaningful vote and the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.ldquoItrsquos very hard to see a circumstance where having voted to pass the deal and then voted to enshrine its provisions in law, Parliament could hold up our exit in order to allow MPs to read the treaty, said the spokesman.The process would be accelerated by a clause in the Withdrawal Agreement Bill itself, which would disapply the terms of the  Act in this case, he said.Mrs May sidestepped demands from several MPs to spell out whether she would ask the EU for an extension to the two-year Brexit negotiation process or allow the UK to crash out without a dealshe hit the March  deadline with no agreement.In stormy exchanges in the Commons, the SNPrsquos Westminster leader Ian Blackford risked being thrown out of the chamber after shouting ldquoliar at the PM.And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn suggested the PM was ldquorunning down the clock on Brexit in the hope that MPs will be ldquoblackmailed by the fear of a no-deal outcome into supporting ldquoa deeply flawed deal.ldquoThis is an irresponsible act, said Mr Corbyn.ldquoShe is playing for time and playing with peoplersquos jobs, our economic security and the future of our industry.Mr Corbyn accused Mrs May of refusing to listen to his alternative deal, involving permanent customs union membership, a close alignment with the single market and matching EU workplace and environmental protections.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn listens to the PMrsquos statement But Mrs May insisted that she was listening to voices outside the Government, adding that ministers would have further talks with Labour on Wednesday on its list of five demandsit is to support a deal.She was heckled as she denied running down the clock, telling Mr Corbyn that she ldquowanted to have this sorted before Christmas.Labour MPs loudly retorted that she had pulled a ldquomeaningful vote in December because of fears she would lose.The PM told the Commons:ldquoWe now all need to hold our nerve to get the changes this House requires and deliver Brexit on time.ldquoBy getting the changes we need to the backstop by protecting and enhancing workersrsquo rights and environmental protections and by enhancing the role of Parliament in the next phase of negotiations I believe we can reach a

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house_11.jpg","title":"future of house of fraser in belfast secured amid fresh lease","story":"Posted on Friday February  by John Mulgrew The future of House of Fraser in Belfast appears to be safe after the retailer signed a fresh lease on its anchor store at Victoria Square, it can be revealed.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
