(Nicola Frega)Cristiano Ronaldo interrupted a post-match interview to hug Gianluigi Buffon after the Juventus goalkeeper was sent off against Real Madrid on Wednesday evening.After losing 3-0 in the first leg of their quarter-final, Juventus scored three times at the Santiago Bernabeu to set up a tense finish.As the match appeared to be heading for extra time, referee Michael Oliver awarded a penalty for Mehdi Benatia’s foul on Lucas Vazquez.Juventus’ players protested the decision for several minutes and a furious Buffon was sent off for his angry reaction towards Oliver.Buffon was sent off for protesting to referee Michael Oliver.

Dreamy.The raffle is now open to entries, and the winner will be announced on 14 October. If you fancy trying your luck with a £5 ticket, you can buy a try on the home’s website.(Picture: SWNS)You’ll need to answer a question about Northampton correctly to be in with a chance of winning. Oh, and you can enter as many times as you want.‘It all sounds a bit mad but when you think about it, it’s a bit loopy but it’s a chance to make a difference,’ says Marty.‘It’s an idea we had a couple of years ago and I was chatting to the missus about it and she gave me a slap and told me not to be so stupid and move on.(Picture: SWNS)‘But I started looking at doing some proper investigation work into it and eventually she came around to the idea.‘It is quite a minefield legally, the terms and conditions, getting round the legalities of the gambling, all that kind of stuff – it’s been a bit of a headache but we got there in the end.‘We’re both nurses and we have 40 years of experience between us of A\u0026ampE and we see dementia patents all the time.(Picture: SWNS)‘The lack of support and facilities for them is scary really, especially in A\u0026ampE where the conditions are worse.‘I see it in the community a lot as well now – if they have mild dementia they can live on their own and have a bit of help but they’re locked in their own homes.‘We sorted out the legalities, got talking to the university through our solicitors about their scheme and what they’re looking to do – they have loads of ideas but a lack of funding.(Picture: SWNS)‘We are used to helping people on a day-to-day and one-by-one basis, doing it this way we can actually help an entire community in one go.’The couple hope to sell 500,000 tickets, which will generate £2.5million if all of the tickets are bought. They’ll give £1million to the dementia research fund run by the University of Northampton, and the Northamptonshire Community Foundation will match the funds.(Picture: SWNS)The couple will take £800,000 to cover the cost of the house and the fees associated with selling it.Marty said: ‘It is a massive house and there’s only me, the missus and a small dog.‘We refurbished it – it was all intended for children but it turns out we can’t have children.‘A lot of the house for us has become redundant, it needs a family – four double beds, three en-suites, walk-in showers, whirl baths, the whole kit and caboodle.(Picture: SWNS)‘The whole top floor, we never go up there – the two double beds on the top floor with en-suites, we never go up there.‘It’s not so much about why should you buy a ticket, but rather why not?‘We used to live in Manchester so we’re contemplating going there next.’MORE: Homelessness and mental health: what’s being done to help?MORE: Is this beauty membership club the new alternative to subscription boxes?"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_7033693.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"instagram model left semi blind surgery change eye colour","story":"Nadinne Bruna had thousands of followers on Instagram for her photos showing off plastic surgery (Picture: SWNS)An Insta-famous model has been left with the vision of a 90-year-old after having surgery to change her eye colour. Nadinne Bruna, 32, wanted light grey eyes instead of hazel, but ended up losing 80 per cent of her vision in her right eye and 50 per cent in her left eye.She lives in Miami but flew to Colombia for the surgery as it is not approved in the US.It cost around $3,000 to have silicone implants inserted into her eyes, a discounted price offered on the condition that she posted about it on social media.Her eyes before the surgery (Picture: SWNS)Nadinne claims her vision was constantly blurry as a result of the pressure placed on her optic nerve by the implant and her eyes were red and painful for months.She returned to Colombia in March and June 2017 for two further procedures to attempt to repair the damage but was forced to seek medical attention at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami.Ophthalmologist Dr Ranya Habash led a team of medics to remove the dangerous implants in September and Nadinne underwent emergency sight-saving surgery to treat glaucoma in November.As a result, the model has lost 80 per cent of vision in her right eye and 50 per cent in her left eye, and will have to deal with the consequences of the surgery for the rest of her life.Nadinne Bruna had the surgery in Bogota, Colombia (Picture: SWNS)Nadinne and her twin sister Danna have forged a career on Instagram, where they share images of the cosmetic procedures they have undergone.The twins regularly have their surgeries compensated and are often paid to feature medical practices on their accounts which have more than one million combined followers.‘Ever since this surgery I have had blurry vision. For about a year my eyes were constantly red and itchy.‘My pupils, they can’t adjust to light anymore so I’m very photosensitive now too.‘This surgery completely f***ed up my life.Nadinne after the surgery (Picture: SWNS)‘In September I was forced to go to hospital in Miami where the doctors said they had to remove the implants to save my sight because of chronic inflammation.‘In November I had emergency glaucoma surgery in both eyes.‘My vision damage is permanent, and I still have to have a cornea transplant and I have cataracts too.’Nadinne said the surgery impacted her career as she was unable to participate in photo shoots for her Instagram page, because of the appearance of her eyes.‘My sister became like my mom. She had to do everything for me,’ she said.‘After this surgery I went into a deep depression. I’m a very strong person, usually very brave and very smart, but with this I was completely stupid. I trusted the wrong person.‘Now I have the vision of a 90-year-old lady right but I’m hoping I can just keep my glaucoma under control.’‘Mrs. Bruna was our patient. However, I do not know any type of treatments that have been carried out on later dates and the results or diagnoses of them.‘I can not comment andor disclose information about patients’ cases or medical records.’She will have eye problems for the rest of her life (Picture: SWNS)Nadinne has not taken legal action against Dr Carbera’s practice as she said she isn’t in the financial position to do so.The model said: ‘It’s crazy, because even though I’ve been open about this surgery on Instagram, people are still are asking me where they can do it.‘But I don’t think surgeries are bad. I just didn’t know the risks and I made a mistake by not doing my research.‘Next month I’m going to have a surgery to reduce my boobs because I’ve lost a lot of weight this year and it’s something I have to do.’Dr Ranya Habash, Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology in Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, said procedures like the one Nadinne opted for cause ‘irreparable’ damage to the eyes.She said: ‘The issue with injecting a silicone plate into the eye is that it clogs the drain of the eye, just like as if a sink was blocked.‘The pressure builds and builds inside the eye, causing inflammation and damaging the structures.‘There’s a reason these procedures are not FDA approved and that’s because we’ve seen the long-term and irreparable damage they can cause.‘Nadinne’s eye problems are something she will have to deal with for the rest of her life.

Debbie Dingell (left) pointed out how many things Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (right) didn\u0027t seem to know about his own website           Rep. Ben Ray Luján told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that he didn\u0027t like how non-users would have to sign up for a Facebook page in order to see what the social network had scooped up about them Luján took issue with the practice because non-users currently had to sign up for Facebook if they wanted to see what data of theirs the social network collected. \u0027You\u0027ve said everyone controls their data, by you\u0027re collecting data on people that are not even Facebook users who have never signed a consent, a privacy agreement,\u0027 Luján said, encouraging Zuckerberg to fix the problem. During the five-hour hearing, the Facebook CEO revealed that his own personal data had been included when 87 million or so Facebook users had their data improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  \u0027Yes,\u0027 he answered when asked by Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat, whether his data was included in the data sold to malicious third parties. \u0027Your personal data?\u0027 Eshoo clarified.  But he pushed back on  suggestions from the members of the House of Representatives that users do not have enough control of their data on Facebook in the wake of the privacy scandal at the world\u0027s largest social media network.\u0027Every time that someone chooses to share something on Facebook ... there is a control.

Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, brought along with him a vintage Dilbert cartoon to make a point about Facebook\u0027s \u0027terms and conditions.\u0027  \u0027I consulted my technology consultant Scott Adams, in the form of Dilbert,\u0027 Burgess said. The cartoon strip shows Dilbert telling Dogbert, \u0027I didn\u0027t read all of my shrink-wrap license agreement on my new software until after I opened it.

Now he\u0027s Bill\u0027s laundry boy,\u0027 Dilbert responded, referencing Microsoft\u0027s CEO. Burgess\u0027 broader point, which he articulated in a tweet, is that too few Americans read the \u0027terms and conditions,\u0027 adding that \u0027consumers should have the tools and resources they need to understand how to protect their own data.\u0027 ZUCKERBERG ASKED ABOUT FACEBOOK PREDECESSOR \u0027FACEMASH\u0027  Rep. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, deployed an interesting line of questioning, asking Zuckerberg about the origins of \u0027Facemash\u0027 and if it was still up and running. \u0027No, congressman. Facemash was a prank website that I launched in college, in my dorm room, before I started Facebook,\u0027 Zuckerberg replied. \u0027There was a movie about this, it says it was about this, of unclear truth, and the claim that Facemash was somehow connected to the development of Facebook, it isn\u0027t, it wasn\u0027t,\u0027 the CEO continued, referencing the 2010 movie, \u0027The Social Network.\u0027 Zuckerberg explained that he created that website in 2003. \u0027It actually has nothing do to with Facebook,\u0027 he said. \u0027And you put up pictures of women and decide which one was the better, the more attractive of the two, is that right?\u0027 Long asked. Zuckerberg said that was right. \u0027Congressman, that is an accurate description of the prank website that I made when I was sophomore in college,\u0027 the CEO said, as Long made comments about the website\u0027s beginnings.           After asking about Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s \u0027Facemash\u0027 website, Rep. Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, brought up perceived bias against Trump-supporting sisters, Diamond and Silk          Rep. Billy Long even went as far as to have an aide hold up a picture of the two women and asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who they were. \u0027I believe that, is that Diamond and Silk?\u0027 the 33-year-old CEO answered LAWMAKERS FIXATE ON DIAMOND AND SILK CONTROVERSYLong then asked staff to hold up a large photograph and asked Zuckerberg to describe who was pictured. \u0027I believe that, is that Diamond and Silk?\u0027 Zuckerberg asked. Long said it was. \u0027That is Diamond and Silk, two biological sisters from North Carolina, I might point out they\u0027re African-American, and their content was deemed by your folks to be unsafe,\u0027 Long said. \u0027Diamond and Silk have a question for you. And that question is, What is unsafe about two black women supporting President Donald J. Trump?\u0027 he continued. A number of Republican lawmakers asked Zuckerberg questions about the Trump-supporting sisters over his two days of testimony on Capitol Hill. \u0027Well Congressman, nothing is unsafe about that,\u0027 Zuckerberg answered.  Facebook acknowledged sending a message to the sisters, prominent conservative video bloggers, deeming their content \u0027unsafe,\u0027 but the social network said the contents of the message were \u0027inaccurate.\u0027 \u0027We have communicated directly with Diamond And Silk about this issue. The message they received last week was inaccurate and not reflective of the way we communicate with our community and the people who run Pages on our platform,\u0027 Facebook\u0027s spokeswoman Sarah Pollack said. In front of lawmakers, Zuckerberg was caught flat-footed, as the Diamond and Silk situation had developed over the past several days. \u0027The specifics of this situation I am not as up to speed on as I would be,\u0027 Zuckerberg told Long.   Other Republicans brought up the Diamond and Silk incident to ask the Facebook co-founder questions about political bias. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, deployed that line of questioning on Tuesday.  \u0027There are a great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship,\u0027 Cruz said. \u0027There have been numerous instances with Facebook.\u0027  Rep. Joe Barton, another Texas Republican, held up his phone and told Zuckerberg he was going to ask him a question that someone had submitted to the congressman\u0027s Facebook account. \u0027First question: Please ask Mr. Zuckerberg, why is Facebook censoring conservative bloggers such as Diamond and Silk? Facebook called them unsafe to the community. That is absurd. They hold conservative views. That isn\u0027t unsafe,\u0027 Barton said reading the question, and adding his own, \u0027What\u0027s your response?\u0027 Zuckerberg explained that his team had made \u0027an enforcement error.\u0027 \u0027And we\u0027ve already gotten in touch with them to reverse it,\u0027 he said, referring to Diamond and Silk. Later on in the hearing Wednesday, Rep.

They were down 0.7 percent in early trading on Wednesday.On Wednesday Zuckerberg\u0027s testimony further bolstered investors\u0027 views of the company, with the CEO\u0027s performance leading them to believe that the company would weather the storm surrounding Cambridge Analytica.   Facebook has been consumed by turmoil for nearly a month, since it came to light that millions of users\u0027 personal information was wrongly harvested from the website by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that has counted President Trump\u0027s election campaign among its clients.Zuckerberg faced broad concerns from members of Congress about how Facebook shares user data.

Ed Markey to endorse a proposed law that would require companies to get people\u0027s permission before sharing personal information, Zuckerberg agreed to further talks.\u0027In principle, I think that makes sense, and the details matter, and I look forward to having our team work with you on fleshing that out,\u0027 Zuckerberg said.But those qualms didn\u0027t rattle Wall Street as Zuckerberg testified that despite the #DeleteFacebook movement, the number of uses of the website hasn\u0027t gone down significantly.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/17/4B0DAC9600000578-5604319-image-a-102_1523464378650.jpg","title":"New Harry Potter covers revealed celebrate 20th anniversary","story":"    To mark the 20th anniversary of the release of  Harry Potter, new covers have been unveiledAfter the news was announced, Brian said: I’m a huge Harry Potter fan (a proud Hufflepuff!) and to be asked to illustrate the 20th anniversary edition covers was an absolute honor.

Tornado jets at RAF Marham in Norfolk were prepared for a sortie this afternoon as ministers gathered in Downing Street            Air crews at the Norfolk base could be deployed to join RAF colleagues already based in Cyprus if the Government launches military action           One of the jets was pictured returning to the runway this afternoon after a flight in the skies over Britain           Fuel tanks for the Tornado jets were also visible being prepared on the airfield today          Tornado jets were being fuelled at RAF Marham in Norfolk today as preparations mounted for reprisals against SyriaThe premier has been bolstered by Brexit Secretary David Davis.Despite voting against military action in Syria in 2013, when David Cameron wanted to respond to another chemical weapons outrage, Mr Davis hinted that he was ready to support it this time.Asked at a conference in London why he had previously opposed strikes, Mr Davis said: \u0027One was because he (Mr Cameron) hadn\u0027t provided the evidence and intelligence that we knew who it was, and secondly because there was not a proper plan which was thought through properly.\u0027Those two things I am assured we\u0027re going to answer today.\u0027 Mr Davis stressed that no final decision had been taken.\u0027It is a very, very delicate circumstance, and we\u0027ve got to make this judgment on a very careful, very deliberate, very well thought-through basis, knowing exactly ... how strong the evidence is,\u0027 he said.  The U.S. has maintained its threat of rocket attacks in response to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad\u0027s sickening chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Douma on Saturday          General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of Joint Forces Command, said Russia\u0027s warnings that launch platforms could be targeted in response to air strikes meant \u0027they are going to try and sink ships, sink submarines and shoot aircraft out of the sky - that\u0027s war\u0027          David Davis today suggested he is ready to support reprisals on the Syrian regime, despite voting against them in 2013          British officials have been in in talks with their counterparts in France and the US about which military assets should be deployed for military action.          President Donald Trump said that an airstrike on Syria could be \u0027very soon or not so soon at all\u0027 as he took to Twitter this morning           It comes after Trump dramatically escalated the rhetoric yesterday by telling Russia to \u0027get ready\u0027 for military action, adding that \u0027nice and new and smart\u0027 cruise missiles \u0027will be coming\u0027 \u0027We are committed to deter and prevent the use of chemical weapons,\u0027 said a government source.\u0027We now have to establish the best way of getting there, and those conversations are carrying on, officials are speaking to their counterparts in France and America right now. In terms of precisely what happens next, that is still to be confirmed.\u0027Some senior ministers have privately been urging the PM to act. Speaking on a visit to Birmingham yesterday, Mrs May said: \u0027The continued use of chemical weapons cannot go unchallenged.\u0027Asked whether she was concerned by Mr Trump\u0027s tweet, she replied: \u0027We are working with our allies, we have been working to get an understanding of what happened on the ground. We are rapidly reaching that understanding. All the indications are that the Syrian regime was responsible.\u0027We will be working with our closest allies on how we can ensure that those who are responsible are held to account and how we can prevent and deter the humanitarian catastrophe that comes from the use of chemical weapons in the future.\u0027          The poll, conducted on Tuesday and yesterday, underlines the problems faced by Theresa May if she pushes ahead with military strikes          Mr Corbyn raised the spectre of Iraq as he made clear he would not back any kind of military action in Syria. In 2015 he defied much of his own shadow cabinet to vote against aistrikes against Isis in the country. \u0027Surely the lessons of Iraq, the lessons that came there from the Chilcot Report, are that there\u0027s got to be, there has to be, a proper process of consultation,\u0027 he said.\u0027We elect Parliament, we elect members of Parliament. They should have a voice in this. Cabinet on its own should not be making this decision.\u0027The dangers of bombing now, which could escalate the conflict beyond belief. Just imagine the scenario if an American missile shoots down a Russian plane or vice versa. Where do we go from there?\u0027 Tory former chancellor Mr Clarke called for a parliamentary vote on any military action, telling BBC Radio 4\u0027s World at One: \u0027In a modern, parliamentary democracy, I think you have got to have parliamentary approval if you have a planned, policy decision to launch a military attack of any significant size.\u0027To say that Parliament is just sidelined before you take such a serious decision is a very retrograde step. It makes parliamentary accountability fairly pathetic.\u0027 Julian Lewis, a Tory MP and chair of the Defence Select Committee, insisted there should be a vote before the UK took action. \u0027There is a real danger that what starts out as justified punishment for the use of chemical weapons ends up with the Royal Air Force serving as the air arm of the jihadi extremist rebels in Syria,\u0027 he said.\u0027It sends a very bad signal to the country that they don\u0027t submit themselves to parliamentary scrutiny before involving in taking military action by choice in the context of a civil war where both sides equally atrocious.\u0027          Mrs May has said Britain will co-ordinate its response to the incident in the rebel-held town of Douma - where at least 40 people are reported to have been killed - with the US and FranceThe US military appeared to be in position to carry out any attack order this morning with a Navy destroyer – armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles – underway in the eastern Mediterranean"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/11/4B131AE300000578-5607281-image-a-24_1523527959056.jpg","title":"Chickens filmed living corpses squalid conditions farms supply Nandos","story":"    Chickens are allegedly being forced to live in squalid and cramped conditions at Stewkley Farm in Buckinghamshire          The video, released by animal welfare charity PETA, shows the small chickens cooped up in long rows with barely any walking spaceThe charity believes the video contradicts Faccenda\u0027s claim on their website that \u0027good welfare is paramount and that means birds that are healthy and comfortable.\u0027PETA director Elisa Allen said: \u0027Faccenda Foods is trying to hoodwink compassionate consumers with its glib, baseless nods to animal welfare.\u0027PETA is calling on authorities to hold this company accountable for duping people into thinking otherwise.\u0027A PETA spokesperson added: \u0027This footage was recorded at a Faccenda farm.\u0027Faccenda is the second-largest chicken-processing company in the UK, supplying five of the largest retailers.\u0027The company claims: \u0027\u0027All our farms are certified to Red Tractor Farm Assurance standards, or equivalent, and we have a zero tolerance attitude toward anything that jeopardises the health and well-being of the animals in our care.\u0027Our birds might not able to talk but they are still the ones who tell us we\u0027re getting it right.\u0027\u0027The charity say they had also spotted signs of bumblefoot - a condition which causes pus-filled abscesses - on some birds.           The charity believes the video contradicts Faccenda\u0027s claim on their website that \u0027good welfare is paramount and that means birds that are healthy and comfortable\u0027          Many of the birds have lost feathers, which PETA says is probably due to stress, inadequate nutrition, or injuries inflicted by other birds          They claim the chickens have been bred to grow so large so quickly that their legs can become crippled, leaving them in agonising pain and unable to walk, eat, drink, or even standMany of the birds have lost feathers, which PETA says is probably due to stress, inadequate nutrition, or injuries inflicted by other birds.They claim the chickens have been bred to grow so large so quickly that their legs can become crippled, leaving them in agonising pain and unable to walk, eat, drink, or even stand.PETA said that chickens are killed at around 40 days old, when they reach \u0027slaughter weight\u0027.Other practices are said to include chickens being scalded in de-feathering tanks - sometimes while still conscious.Faccenda is the second-largest chicken-processing company in the UK and sells meat to national firms such as Asda, Lidl, and Nando\u0027s.A spokesman for the company said: \u0027All of our farms operate to standards above EU and UK legislation.\u0027They are independently audited and visited on a regular basis by an external vet to monitor bird health and welfare.\u0027Revealed: Salmonella in chicken salad killed 1 person and...Is the most Australian athlete ever?

In 1966 a DIY store opened at the site and it has been used as retail and storage space  for the past 50 yearsIn later years internal units have been let out for a variety of uses and retail and storage has continued ever since including some of the outside spaces.Leisure activities have proved to be popular for previous tenants and indeed the building lends itself for this type of use.The high security features of the site have proved to be particularly attractive to tenants.The old ammunition store which extends in area to approximately 127 sq m, has walls which are about 8ft thick and provides a very secure facility which is typical of the building as a whole.Included with the sale of the property is a range of outbuildings and storage facilities together with various materials, items of equipment, fittings and other contents which could prove to be of use for future maintenance purposes.

The BBC appoints a prominent radical leftist, a lifelong Bennite, the chairman of the publisher of a prominent leftwing publication no less, as its flagship political presenter and interviewer. This person has made speeches in homage of Karl Marx calling for the establishment of full-blooded socialism in Britain, including a massive increase in public ownership, hiking taxes on the rich to fund a huge public investment programme, and reversing anti-union laws. They appear on our “impartial” Auntie Beeb wearing a tie emblazoned with the logo of a hardline leftist thinktank. Their BBC editor is a former Labour staffer who moves to become Jeremy Corbyn’s communications chief. They use their Twitter feed – where they have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers thanks to a platform handed to them by the BBC – to promote radical leftist causes.This would never happen. It is unthinkable, in fact. If the BBC establishment somehow entered this parallel universe, the British press would be on the brink of insurrection. And yet, the strange case of Andrew Neil, the ultra-Thatcherite former Sunday Times editor who is the BBC’s flagship political presenter, is an instructive example about how our media works.Neil is a formidable political interviewer in many ways: forensic, unrelenting, quick-witted, sardonic. But consider the background of this former Conservative party researcher. When Jeremy Corbyn had the audacity to meet with leftwing Jewish group Jewdas, Neil smeared them as “nutters” last year, he made a speech denouncing antisemitism on the left. To be clear, leftwing antisemitism exists and must be vanquished. But Neil has no moral authority on this issue. As editor of the Sunday Times in 1992, he hired Britain’s foremost Holocaust denier, Nazi apologist David Irving, to work on the Goebbels diaries. To hire a sympathiser of Hitler and denier of the worst atrocity in history to do respectable work for a national newspaper – to offer a reputational lifeline to a man who should have been treated as a pariah – was a disgrace for which he has never apologised. As the Wiener Library, the oldest institution devoted to the study of the Holocaust, said at the time: “David Irving denies the gas chambers. Anyone who deals with him is tainted with that.”Not long after becoming a high-profile BBC presenter, Neil made a speech in homage to rightwing radical Friedrich Hayek, in which he called for a “radical programme to liberalise the British economy a radical reduction in tax and public spending as a share of the economy” as well as a flat tax “and the injection of choice and competition into the public sector on a scale not yet contemplated”. During last year’s general election, he presented the Daily Politics wearing a tie emblazoned with the logo of the hardcore neoliberal Adam Smith Institute. His editor was Robbie Gibb, a former adviser to Michael Portillo – another longstanding colleague of Neil on This Week. Last year Gibb became Theresa May’s head of communications.Neil’s Twitter account – which has hundreds of thousands of followers thanks to his BBC gig – is routinely used to promote rightwing causes. He uses this platform to denounce the scientific consensus on climate change, reviling what he calls “the climate mafia” and claiming that deviation from the consensus meant “the witch-finders want to burn you”. It is not the first time he has deviated from scientific consensus. When he was Sunday Times editor, his newspaper ran a series of articles arguing that HIV did not cause Aids. It was a theme picked up by the Spectator 15 years later. Let’s be clear: this contemptible myth risked people’s lives. His Twitter feed, too, reveals a relentless sympathy for Brexit and denunciation of its critics. A valid political perspective, but not coming from the BBC’s main politics presenter on the biggest issue facing Britain. Again unsurprising, given that he once called “for a reorientation of British foreign policy away from Europe towards Asia and Latin America”and “unilateral free trade, regardless of the policy in Brussels”.His firebrand rightwing politics aside, Neil skins politicians alive across the political spectrum, comes the inevitable retort. There is no question that Neil is exceptionally bright and well-read with an acute eye for detail: it is a grave error to turn up unprepared with him in the chair, as I discovered in one of my earliest TV appearances. And yes, he did recently take down a Tory minister for the absurd smears against Corbyn over a crank ex-Czechoslovak spy: that he was applauded for doing his job here shows how low the left’s expectations are. But as a general rule, while Neil will fillet politicians on both left and right on the basis of competence, he reserves his ideological assaults for the left, ridiculing Corbyn over Russia – which one would expect on US TV networks, where impartiality rules do not apply.Last month, when Green MP Caroline Lucas tabled an Urgent Question on bullying and harassment in Parliament, Neil excoriated her for not talking about rape in Telford instead. When Lucas responded that the Telford case was “absolutely appalling” and that she backed an urgent public inquiry into the matter, but that didn’t mean MPs shouldn’t get their own House in order, Neil denounced her for making a comparison between “what some middle class women had suffered” and the Telford scandal – one he alone had made. The consequence was an online pile-on. Imagine if a prominent leftwing BBC journalist existed and launched such a baseless out-of-nowhere attack on a rightwing politician?Why does this all matter? Critiquing any prominent journalist normally results in a defensive backlash: it is regarded as the ultimate sin within media ranks. But the issue here is about a system. The media are one of the most essential pillars of any democracy, and must be critiqued as such. The usual BBC defence is that the corporation is attacked from both sides, and therefore must be neutral. This is a logical fallacy. For one, it does not take into account which side is more assertive or dominant. Our press overwhelmingly supports the Tories and is intolerant of even mild deviations from rightwing orthodoxy. The BBC itself is dominated by social and economic liberalism, which is why it provokes ire from left and right: but that isn’t neutrality, either. Its daily news priorities are set and framed by the front pages of Conservative-supporting newspapers.Neil himself would be the most intimidating and effective rightwing polemicist in Britain if he was freed from the BBC. But the fact that somebody as stridently leftwing as he is rightwing would never be appointed to such a position is indicative of how our media operate. Many on the left fear that any critique of Auntie will play into the hands of a right wing that would privatise and gut the BBC if it could. This deference means that BBC political output remains framed by rightwing assumptions. The Media Reform Coalition has suggested a series of proposals, such as freeing the BBC from all government interference and a BBC board elected by licence-payers and BBC staff. At the very least, as the case of Neil underlines, the left – which, after all, represents millions of Britons – must stop accepting its continued media marginalisation as just one of those things. It isn’t – and it must change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7008e50caf4ef1c7e77429a5840350ff8b324312/0_55_1632_979/master/1632.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3118d5ffc04a7fd88c80afacc9e410af 1240w","title":"good friday agreement mo mowlam","story":"As I watched the 20-year celebrations of the Good Friday agreement play out, my frustration and anger began\u0026nbspto boil over. “Where the fuck\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspshe?” I wanted to shout at the\u0026nbsptelevision and radio. As the day went on I decided to just avoid the media altogether it was only going to make me cross, and that’s not what the day was about.\u0026nbspIt was a day to celebrate something extraordinary, the impossible becoming possible.Mo Mowlam was my stepmum, but for most people she is remembered for the work she did helping to bring peace to Northern Ireland. When Mo arrived as Northern Ireland secretary in 1997, the job was reputed to be a “poisoned chalice”. However, Mo not only brought the opposing parties to the table but also helped persuade a country of ided communities to come together for the sake of peace and progress.I missed Mo more this week than I do on the anniversary of her death, or her birthday. Her absence was everywhere in the British media’s coverage of the anniversary of the agreement. I felt powerless as I watched the old guard being paraded across our screens. In their defence, Mo can’t be there of course. She died from cancer back in 2005.On Tuesday, Tony Blair gave his speech in Belfast on the anniversary of the agreement signing. It was a stark oversight that he didn’t even mention her name. He\u0026nbspmade no acknowledgment of her role in the negotiations at all. Perhaps he was afraid that he might get another standing ovation about someone else\u0026nbspin the\u0026nbspmiddle of one of his speeches?I would go so far as to say that without Mo there would be no peace process in Northern Ireland. She applied her own distinctive personality and approach to the job. She demonstrated empathy and understanding. She recognised and listened to victims and survivors. She worked closely with the men but also very importantly the women – mothers, daughters, girlfriends and wives – of Northern Ireland in order to achieve peace.Mo was from a family of strong women her father was an alcoholic which meant her mother and older sister held her family together. Her inclusion of women was imperative to the peace process – she knew that without help from the women in the community, there was no way she was going to be able to persuade the men to join the conversation. She had to find the humanity in and commonality between families and relationships from all sides, in order to help people find hope.Some have argued that Mo was not able to actually “seal the deal” in the end, and that things began to unravel on her watch. Or that there’s a “myth of Mo” and her role in the peace process. In 2005 when Mo died, Blair said of her: “It is no exaggeration to say she transformed the politics not just of Northern Ireland itself but crucially of relations between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, and it was this transformation that created the culture in which peace-making could flourish … suddenly nationalist, republican and Catholic Ireland had every preconception of the English up-ended and rendered out of date. She didn’t have to talk about equality. She exuded it, naturally and with an absence of affectation that was marvellous to behold … she bowled everyone over.”As a director of documentary films, I’ve spent a lot of time in Northern Ireland and the republic since Mo\u0026nbspdied. The island is a second home to me, having been so formative in my teenage years and early 20s. In anticipation of the rewriting of the history books (or at least the omission of certain characters!) I’ve been pitching a film to commissioners at various broadcasters: an authored, personal story in Mo’s memory that would celebrate and explore her legacy for contemporary women. I’ve been told “no one would be interested”. That they “couldn’t see who would watch it”.Seemingly a fitting narrative when you look at what played out on the media over the past few days.The only place I have seen Mo remembered as she\u0026nbspshould be this week was in the middle of a documentary presented by the comedian Patrick Kielty in which he recalled her honesty and straight talking. It\u0026nbspmade me smile watching the archive of a show he had\u0026nbsphosted, with her as a guest. As he said, Mo was “greeted like a rock star, not a politician” when she entered the TV studio. A testament to her humanity and\u0026nbspability to connect with all walks of life.Everyone has a story about Mo, and I am constantly\u0026nbspamazed by how many people she met in the\u0026nbspworld. How many people she touched. You can’t just\u0026nbsperase that memory, however hard they try. She never\u0026nbspjust “flew in when the cameras were turned on” –\u0026nbspif\u0026nbspanything she snuck out and went to see people when\u0026nbspno one was watching. The thing about Mo was that\u0026nbspit came to her instinctively. She didn’t think about it,\u0026nbspit wasn’t a strategy, it was instinct, it was passion and\u0026nbspit was sheer\u0026nbspdetermination.Mo knew the Good Friday agreement was just the beginning, she knew it was a process and when she died she hoped that whoever took over those reins would honour that, would work at that and would help the people of Northern Ireland to progress to true peace. It wasn’t the finished article, and this is where I believe people are going wrong. They are celebrating an end, a solution but it was a beginning, a starting point. Neil Kinnock at her memorial started his speech about Mo with a very simple statement: “A light has gone out.”I often think of those words. A light did go out when Mo left the stage, and while many people will attempt to\u0026nbsplive in the afterglow of her memory, they cannot remove her from the memories of the people.• Henrietta Norton is a documentary director and writer.

(I always thought Simon Cowell was a stark example of this, someone who, while no doubt appalling in lots of ways, was made to answer too widely for bad taste in primetime TV).If I had given Mark Zuckerberg much thought before now, I would probably have put him in a similar category, as someone I considered with vague distaste but no real animosity. Then several things happened in rapid succession to recategorise Facebook\u0026nbspin my mind from a simple bad habit – in which the onus was on me, the addict, to seek help or move on – to something else: an entity whose sole purpose is to\u0026nbsptake\u0026nbspthe piss out\u0026nbspof its users.It was a piece in the New York Times last week that\u0026nbsparticulated this fact more clearly than I have seen elsewhere and in a way that finally drove the point home: we, as Facebook users, are not the company’s customers but the company’s product.The other lightbulb moment came courtesy of Zuckerberg’s appearance before the Senate committee,\u0026nbspwhich not only provided a handy and highly personalised visual on which to hang one’s dislike – the\u0026nbspbland face, the android expression, the cult-like choice of Facebook-blue tie – but also offered\u0026nbspcast-iron\u0026nbspproof of the company’s bad faith.It was Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator for South Carolina, who finally flushed out the disingenuousness at the heart of Facebook’s utopian mission statement. Graham invited Zuckerberg to remember an internal memo that circulated at Facebook in 2016 in which the author, Andrew Bosworth, a vice-president of the company who once taught Zuckerberg at Harvard, jocularly noted that while maybe Facebook “costs a life by exposing someone to bullies” or “maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools”, hey-ho, “anything that allows us to connect more people more\u0026nbspoften is de facto good”.No action was taken against Bosworth, and even\u0026nbspthough Zuck assured the senators he didn’t agree with\u0026nbspthe memo’s statement, he also added, in a\u0026nbspwinsome aside: “Boz is what we call him internally.” For some reason it\u0026nbspwas the chummy cuteness of “Boz” that put the final\u0026nbspnail in the coffin.

Labour has pledged to restore the education maintenance allowance, worth up to £30 a week to 16- to 19-year-olds still in education. Its abolition by the coalition had a devastating effect on low-income families trying to keep teenagers in school and college with no free school meals or travel.Free buses would be one step towards an urgently needed intergenerational shift against the tide of wealth and income flowing away from the young into the well-protected pockets of the old. The £1.4bn cost would come from vehicle excise duty, using funds currently allocated to road building, which would then be covered by its new National Transformation Fund.This policy is a tiptoe towards universal basic services, a policy idea that sprang last year from King’s College’s Prof Jonathan Portes and UCL’s Prof Henrietta Moore. Rather than universal basic income, they suggest providing universal services such as free buses, free wifi and telephones, plus free food and housing for the poorest, as a more effective redistribution.Their universal free buses would cost £5bn, a price that looks like a remarkably good bargain. The message it sends out – that anyone has the right to travel anywhere – embraces a sense of universal community it would be hard to obtain with £5bn spent on anything else. Bus passes for the old are so popular with Tory and Labour voters alike that no party in its right mind would dare take them away – or even to means-test them for those needing no subsidy from less well-off taxpayers. To offer free buses to all is the right way to make it fairer.However, the political question is whether Labour announcing yet more spending at this point does anything for Corbyn’s weak economic credibility, as he stays a dismal 10 points behind Theresa May as best to run the economy and lead the country. Labour needs policies that shore up public belief in its fiscal probity to reach beyond its young base – already pollsters find age is the single biggest determinant as to whether someone votes Labour or Tory. Good policies don’t win without good politics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65ed1032ebe439ce7dd21cafafa569d27911653a/0_142_1281_769/master/1281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d23a3c25c357ddbdace9dfef563f7cf9 1240w","title":"the silver caesars renaissance masterpieces reunited after a century","story":"Exhibition tries to solve what Mary Beard describes as ‘greatest jigsaw puzzle on earth’Even the Rothschilds, some of the wealthiest collectors in Victorian Europe, never saw anything like the treasure now displayed in a drawing room at one of their palatial houses, Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire. The Silver Caesars – statuettes, bases and bowls known as tazze, each over a foot tall and made from more than six pounds of silver – have been briefly reunited after being separated at least a century ago.In the 19th century, the 12 Renaissance masterpieces were gilded. Some were given new bases, thought to look more imposingly historic, and the pieces were scattered into museum and private collections.  One was sold recently to a member of the Qatari ruling family for around £1m. Branches of the Rothschild family had at least five at one point, but never managed to asssemble the complete set. Another was owned by the father of Ferdinand de Rothschild, who built Waddesdon in 1877 to hold his own spectacular collections, but the Caesar was bequeathed to the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada instead of Ferdinand. The Caesars and the 48 scenes from their lives displayed on the supporting dishes, taken from the vivid accounts of the Roman historian Suetonius, have been correctly matched partly thanks to the sharp eye of the classicist Mary Beard, who is working on a book about Suetonius. Beard visited the Victoria and Albert Museum in London to study the figure of Domitian. Peering at the scenes supposedly from his life, she realised the procession illustrated was not that of Domitian but of Tiberius, described by Suetonius scrambling out of his chariot in his hour of triumph to kneel humbly before his father, Augustus.Her insight, and the realisation that an international museum swap more than half a century earlier had muddled the statuettes and bases, led to an epic international project in which all the Caesars met at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. The Met owns one Caesar and has another on long-term loan, but managed to borrow all the others. The pieces were correctly assembled and photographed together for the first time, then disassembled and sent back to their owners. Three years later they were reunited again for an exhibition in New York, and now they meet almost certainly for the last time at Waddesdon.The Caesars are regarded as some of the most spectacular surviving masterpieces of Renaissance metalwork, but also the most puzzling Beard calls them “the greatest jigsaw puzzle on earth”. They are known as the Aldobrandini Tazze after one of their first owners, and were assumed to be Italian when sold in London in 1826. The pieces are now thought to have been made in northern Europe, probably for a member of the Habsburg dynasty, but nothing about them is known for certain.“We still can only surmise, based on all our research, when they were made, where and for whom,” says Julia Siemon, the art historian at the Met who led the project.The survival of all the bowls, six of the original bases and 11 of the figures is regarded as extraordinary. “Works of art in silver were literally made of money, so whenever you needed money you just melted it down,” Siemon says. She believes the tazze were given as diplomatic gifts by a Habsburg archduke travelling to Italy for a dynastic wedding. The whereabouts of the green velvet book, last described centuries ago, that supposedly explains the whole riddle is unknown. Siemon says: “I still have a faint hope that maybe as a result of the publicity for this exhibition, somebody will open their bookcase and find it.” The Caesars are described as “heartstoppingly beautiful” by Pippa Shirley, head of collections at Waddesdon. “This exhibition will never happen again,” she adds.

It’ll be your home from home for many months, so you need to find the right property. Whether you’re after a warm place to study or a pre-drinks venue, here’s what to consider before signing up.A shared student house is usually a house in multiple occupation (HMO) governed by strict criteria under the Housing Act 2004, which stipulates that rooms must be a minimum of 6.51 sq metres. The local authority will set amenity standards, such as the number of bathrooms, toilets, handbasins and sinks, and the size of worktops and fridge space. Most shared student homes require a licence, so you should make sure you see one before signing the tenancy. Landlords and agents are legally required to provide certain documents to tenants, including the gas safety certificate, energy performance certificate (EPC) and deposit protection certificate. Squeezing in with your mates may sound like fun, but space is hugely important for students, says Les Back, a sociology professor at Goldsmiths, University of London. Landlords may use shared space as extra bedrooms to maximise profit, so be aware of how this can affect your studies and wellbeing. “The lack of study space to work at home can’t be healthy at all,” says Back. “Students need support. Degrees can be incredibly demanding socially, intellectually and emotionally and it doesn’t help when accommodation is pressurised.”Students today are more discerning about the type of property they are prepared to rent than they were a generation ago. This means landlords are no longer able to buy rundown properties, throw in some secondhand beds and desks and sit back while the rent comes in. Nowadays, students can expect high-speed, reliable internet connection, a communal living area and some well-kept outside space.Always ask to see the EPC. According to an NUS spokesperson, half of students report feeling uncomfortably cold in their accommodation, and many properties are draughty or poorly insulated: “The most commonly encountered complaint in rented accommodation is damp, condensation or mould. Alarmingly, almost a quarter of respondents reported having slugs, mice or another infestation in their home – so make sure to ask plenty of questions about the state of the property.”Talk to the current tenants if possible. Finding out why they are leaving and the worst thing about the house could help raise red flags.For most students, this will be the first time they have had to look for a house and take out a private tenancy. So, with less experience of how the market operates, they are at higher risk of being exploited by landlords or agents. Getting a fair break clause is one way to ensure you can leave the property if you have to. Six months is the legal minimum of a tenancy. Agents are increasingly offering longer-term tenancies, but David Cox, chief executive of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, says they should rarely be taken up without a six-month break clause. This also means private landlords need to up their game to remain competitive. “Purpose-built accommodation is likely to be a lot swankier and possibly offer on-site facilities unlike traditional houses converted for student living. That said, the latter may offer a greater opportunity to meet and get to know your landlord and build a direct connection with them, which can be invaluable in resolving any issues that crop up,” says Davis.Decide what you can afford before you start house-hunting. Remember you will have to budget for gas, electricity, water, phone, internet and a TV licence, as well as food and general household items. Find out which, if any, bills are included. Beware of agency scams. “One thing I remember is just before you sign the lease they always ring you up and pretend someone has just put a last-minute offer in and ask if you want to go higher to beat it, to squeeze more money out of you,” says former law student John Cole, 28, from Yorkshire.Ask yourself how convenient the area is. That means looking at local amenities, but also considering costs such as transport. Although it can be cheaper to live further away from your university, it may be important to be close to the library and be around other students who can provide support.

The design is not dissimilar to that of a Scalextric track, although should the vehicle overtake, the arm is automatically disconnected.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.comThe electrified road is ided into 50m sections, with an inidual section powered only when a vehicle is above it.When a vehicle stops, the current is disconnected. The system is able to calculate the vehicle’s energy consumption, which enables electricity costs to be debited per vehicle and user.The “dynamic charging” – as opposed to the use of roadside charging posts – means the vehicle’s batteries can be smaller, along with their manufacturing costs.A former diesel-fuelled truck owned by the logistics firm, PostNord, is the first to use the road.Hans Säll, chief executive of the eRoadArlanda consortium behind the project, said both current vehicles and roadways could be adapted to take advantage of the technology.In Sweden there are roughly half a million kilometres of roadway, of which 20,000km are highways, Säll said.“If we electrify 20,000km of highways that will definitely be be enough,” he added. “The distance between two highways is never more than 45km and electric cars can already travel that distance without needing to be recharged. Some believe it would be enough to electrify 5,000km.”At a cost of €1m per kilometre, the cost of electrification is said to be 50 times lower than that required to construct an urban tram line.Säll said: “There is no electricity on the surface. There are two tracks, just like an outlet in the wall. Five or six centimetres down is where the electricity is. But if you flood the road with salt water then we have found that the electricity level at the surface is just one volt. You could walk on it barefoot.”National grids are increasingly moving away from coal and oil and battery storage is seen as crucial to a changing the source of the energy used in transportation. The Swedish government, represented by a minister at the formal inauguration of the electrified road on Wednesday, is in talks with Berlin about a future network. In 2016, a 2km stretch of motorway in Sweden was adapted with similar technology but through overhead power lines at lorry level, making it unusable for electric cars.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

It won plenty of awards, but the 30-year-old faced a dark backlashA few months after the actor, musician and author Nakhane started receiving online death threats, he developed an unorthodox reaction to them. Call it a coping mechanism, but the 30-year-old could not help but assess the linguistic flair of his fellow South Africans. “It was interesting for my own people to describe in great detail how they wanted to kill me,” he says, softly. “But some of the descriptions were so poetic that I was like: ‘Hey, people can write. They can write, eh?’” He lets out a dry chortle, spiked with weariness, and leans in over his post-photoshoot glass of red wine. “It was poetic, but dark.”He is a long way from home, sitting in a north London bar, but the ripple effects of the acting role that inspired graphic threats against his life still resonate. Nakhane stars in The Wound (Inxeba), a tender and intimate film that weaves one story, of male same-sex desire in rural South Africa, with another, about what happens when urbanised and queer teen Kwanda (played by newcomer Niza Jay Ncoyini) kicks back against ingrained tradition. It is a film so visceral you find yourself clenching your fists and wincing while anticipating the slap of violence during its most tense scenes.But, really, the reason so much anger was directed at Nakhane, his co-stars and the director, John Trengove, was because The Wound features approximate depictions of ulwaluko – the secret rite of passage into manhood observed by the Xhosa tribe – and guy-on-guy sex scenes. Implying that the initiation, which involves circumcision, could have any proximity to homosexuality was more than some people could take. Add to that a white director telling a black African story and controversy followed the film at every turn. For Nakhane, who is still clumsily referred to as “openly gay” in the local press, that reaction seeped into his own life.“Initially, people jumped to conclusions that the film would be some sort of exposé” – and he laces his next line with sarcasm – “because that would be interesting … They saw a trailer. They saw queerness. And they went nuts, because: ‘How dare you?’.” Outrage ensued, in verbal statements given by the Xhosa king, on the streets, in the media and on the internet. Nakhane recalls one protest at Wits University in Johannesburg: “There was a standoff between people on either side of the argument. This guy kept shouting about: ‘IF it’s true, IF this happens between men,’ and I couldn’t get him out of my head.” That is because Nakhane’s experience goes beyond the hypothetical. “I was propositioned. I” – and he points at his chest – “me. And not once. So I know from direct experience. And what’s next after that? To say that I’m lying?”He exhales these sentences with an animated passion, all hand sweeping and eye-rolls. He manages to be warm, even when recounting how one of his social media posts promoting the film spread a rage through his Xhosa community “like a wildfire”. His magnetic personality seems antithetical to that of Xolani, his character in the film, who maintains a secret love affair with Vija, a fellow caregiver to the teenage boys when they travel to a remote mountain for the initiation. “To prepare,” he recalls, “John said to me: ‘Imagine who you are and that everyone in the world loves you. It’s a warm day. Can you feel it?’ Yes, I could. ‘OK, so take that feeling, put it in a box and squash it. That’s where you are, as a character.’”Although Nakhane speaks freely about his sexual orientation – largely at the prompting of journalists, it must be said – he, too, used to be closeted, like Xolani. He was born in Alice, once a model town for apartheid regime propaganda in the Eastern Cape, where heteronormative views ruled. At the age of 15, he moved to Johannesburg, and came out a few years later. He briefly reverted to a form of “pray the gay away” fundamentalism and lived in denial about his sexual preferences, but, by his late 20s, with a career as a soulful pop performer blossoming, he had accepted himself at last.“Now, my sister tells me about friends of hers in school who were gay and out in grade 8, aged 14. And I’d ask how that was being received: ‘No one cares.’ I never would have dreamed, at 14, of being able to do that. Fourteen! I mean, I was feisty to come out at 17.” He laughs again.While the film racked up awards, from the Durban and London film festivals to LGBT film festivals in Madrid, San Francisco and Lisbon, one branch of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa worked with the country’s Man and Boy Foundation to have it censored on its release in February. The Wound ended up with an X18 rating from the country’s censor, a classification generally reserved for porn – before its backers went to court in an attempt to have a less restrictive rating.Speaking via Skype, Trengove reflected on a tumultuous ride. As a white director, he has dealt with another layer of backlash, from those who think he should not have told this story. He chooses his words carefully, pointing out how he co-wrote the script with Thando Mgqolozana and Malusi Bengu, both Xhosa men. “From the beginning, my own whiteness was a huge thing to reconcile, or at least grapple with, in the construction of the film,” he says. “The difficulty and discomfort of it is something I knew I was taking on. But the reasons for making the film under these circumstances outweighed those for not making it.”He has watched The Wound prompt debate about race, tradition, what constitutes pornography, and gayness – in a country whose progressive constitution protects LGBT rights in theory, but less so in practice.All the drama surrounding the film, though, may distract from a simple fact: Nakhane’s performance is a delicate revelation. His past work as a musician and author (his debut novel, Piggy Boy’s Blues, was published in 2015) informs the emotional depths he plumbs in this first-ever professional acting role.“He brought an understanding that, in order to do interesting work, you have to step outside your own comfort zone,” Trengove says. “It’s something a lot of actors struggle with, which he did very intuitively. And that is what you see in the film.” He adds: “There’s something incredibly expressive about Nakhane, a way in which what’s going on, on the inside, pours out of him. He has a translucency that I knew could work on camera.”It beams out in person, too. When I ask how he reflects on the fever of the backlash, from this vantage point thousands of miles away, his eyes lock into focus. “Some people say: ‘Aren’t you tired of always having to talk about the fact that you’re a gay artist?’ and I’m like: ‘You have no fucking idea how tired I am of it.’ But for as long as I need to, I’m going to talk about it. Sure, it’s annoying that sometimes you see an article that splashes with ‘GAY MUSICIAN’, but do you know how many openly gay musicians there are in South Africa?”He looks resolute, calm. “For as long as it needs to be said, then it needs to be said. For as long as there’s some kid out there who can’t be themselves, he’ll need someone.”The Wound is in UK cinemas from 27 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3be17dac504143f920bc5b60c905c4c9569ea44d/0_130_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6dcaa1aab00ebcc7f9215cd3595245f8 1240w","title":"peter bradshaw cannes 2018 lineup","story":"The streaming giant has been barred, the female director quotient is low, but the lineup, from Asghar Farhadi’s opener onwards, is undeniably smart-lookingSome mixed signals with the traditional unveiling of the Cannes film festival’s official selection: a very lively and effervescent list, with eight newcomers in competition and plenty of big names sidelined. No Mike Leigh, and no Claire Denis, although their new films may not be ready – or they may in fact be added in the next few days.But there are some notable entries from the silverbacks of the auteur big league, including Jean-Luc Godard and Spike Lee. The new Star Wars episode will provide a little pop-culture confectionery – and perhaps there will be stormtroopers roaming the Croisette as there were the last time a Star Wars movie was presented at Cannes. Wim Wenders is in the Special Screenings sidebar with his documentary Pope Francis: A Man of His Word, although His Holiness is not expected to make an appearance on the red carpet.This is the first Cannes lineup since the explosion of #MeToo and #TimesUp, when festival director Thierry Frémaux announced his “consternation” at the revelations about Cannes habitué Harvey Weinstein. But with 15 male and three female directors in competition, the festival isn’t taking obvious steps along the “ersity” route being suggested elsewhere. Frémaux has announced that “There will never be a selection with positive discrimination” — although “positive discrimination” is not precisely what campaigners are arguing for.The other issue is, of course, the Netflix controversy: last year, the French industry was furious that Netflix films were allowed into competition despite not showing in French cinemas this year Cannes barred them from competing, and then Netflix declined to enter any of its films in the non-competitive strands, including its much-anticipated restoration of Orson Welles’s The Other Side of the Wind – a big blow to cinephiles.The festival has, perhaps unfortunately, combined the announcement about the Netflix absence with another about selfies being banned on the red carpet this year. It creates the inadvertent impression that Cannes considers Netflix and selfies to be all just part of the vulgar new media world that the festival wishes to rise above.Well, this is certainly another tasty list, made even more alluring by the fact that press screenings will no longer happen in advance. Everyone sees the film at the same time. Secrets are kept. Surprises – and shocks – are preserved. But there will undoubtedly be a huge and disorderly crush outside the screening theatres for the biggest names. And it is still a mystery why Cannes simply does not introduce review embargos. The opening film comes from Asghar Farhadi, a film-maker who has become one of the festival’s most honoured guests. His Everybody Knows is a Spanish-language psychological thriller, starring Penélope Cruz, Javier Bardem and Ricardo Darín. A genre movie from this director will certainly be a sugar-rush beginning to the festival, although perhaps he will turn out to be too subtlea film-maker to handle this sort of material.Jean-Luc Godard’s The Image Book promises to be another complex meditation on the nature of culture and communication, like his previous competition entry Farewell to Language. The film avowedly concerns: “Nothing but silence, nothing but a revolutionary song, a story in five chapters like the five fingers of a hand.” Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman brings this director to Cannes for the first time since 1991, when he was at the festival with Jungle Fever. The movie, produced by Get Out director Jordan Peele, is about the real-life story of Ron Stallworth, the black police officer who went undercover in 1978 to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan — speaking on the phone to Klansmen and sending white officers in his place when face-to-face meetings were required. He is played by John David Washington, son of Denzel Washington. The much-admired Alice Rohrwacher – whose 2014 film The Wonders was in competition at Cannes – brings her new film Lazzaro Felice to the Croisette this year, a film which also heralds a welcome return for the Spanish actor Sergi López. Rohrwacher is keeping the details of the film quiet, but intriguingly says that it concerns a man who time-travels 50 years.Paweł Pawlikowski is the nearest thing Britain has an interest in Cannes this year – this Polish director moved to the UK when he was a teenager, settling in the country at the age of 20. His Zimna Wojna, or Cold War concerns a love story between two mismatched people in Poland during the cold war of the 1950s.Lee Chang-dong is one of the mightiest of the Cannes regulars – a really superb film-maker whose films are always a must-see at the festival. His new competition film, Burning, is an adaptation of the 1992 New Yorker short story Barn Burning by the Japanese author Haruki Murakami, about a writer who meets a mysterious figure at a party claiming to be an arsonist. It’s always a relief to find something described as “feelgood” at Cannes, and that is how Three Faces, the new film from acclaimed Iranian film-maker Jafar Panahi, was decribed by Thierry Frémaux at the press conference. The film tells the story of three Iranian actresses: one pre-revolutionary veteran who has now retired, one current star and one acting student. It is not clear whether the Iranian authorities will permit Panahi to travel abroad to attend the festival in person: he is still subject to a travel ban due to his pro-democracy campaigns.Another Cannes regular is Hirokazu Kore-eda, whose Shoplifters comes into competition this year. It is another family drama – a genre that Kore-eda has inherited from Ozu and Naruse. The second Japanese director at Cannes is Ryusuke Hamaguchi, with his Netemo Sametemo, or Sleeping or Waking based on the novel by Tomoka Shibasaki, it has a rather Hitchcockian premise. A young woman living in Osaka falls in love with a free-sprited man who one day mysteriously disappears. Then two years later, in Tokyo, she meets a man who looks exactly like the man she lost.If there is a really sexy entrant, it is Under the Silver Lake, by David Robert Mitchell who set Cannes alight with his scary movie It Follows, which was part of Critics’ week in 2014. It is billed as a neo-noir black comedy (written by Mitchell): Andrew Garfield plays Sam, a guy who has fallen hopelessly in love with his beautiful neighbour who then disappears. Intriguing – but possibly overcooked?Matteo Garrone is a Cannes heavy-hitter from Italy pretty much guaranteed a place here. His competition film Dogman is an “urban western”, apparently inspired by a bizarre true-crime story from 1980: torture and murder committed by a coke-addled dog groomer on the outskirts of Rome. It’s a film that promises to return this director to the naturalistic style of his great mob drama, Gomorrah.Jia Zhangke is a Chinese director who has a kind of A-list status on the festival circuit, while being rather less well known at home. Either way, he is another big Cannes beast, and his Ash Is Purest White, a love story set in China’s crime underworld, looks like a characteristically ambitious and even epic film.Kirill Serebrennikov is the progressive Russian theatre and film director who is currently under house arrest in Russia for supposed financial irregularities – which many see as the government’s pretext for cracking down on this director’s criticism of the government. His film Leto, or Summertime, is a love triangle set in Moscow in the early 80s, to a soundtrack of western rock music such as Bowie and Led Zeppelin.It wouldn’t be Cannes if the craggy-faced (and excellent) French actor Vincent Lindon did not appear in a French film. Last year, sadly, he showed up in a silly movie about Rodin. This year he is back in En Guerre, or At War, by the French director Stéphane Brizé — another social-realist drama about a factory shutdown and a workers’ representative battling to save jobs.The other French auteur is Christophe Honoré with Plaire, Aimer et Courir Vite, or Pleasure, Love and Running Fast – the English title is Sorry Angel. The movie brings two lives into alignment: a middle-aged writer in Paris and a young student in Brittany — it stars Pierre Deladonchamps, Vincent Lacoste and Denis Podalydès.Eva Husson made her startling debut in 2015 at Toronto with her Bang Gang (A Modern Love Story), now she is at Cannes with her follow-up, Les Filles du Soleil, or Girls of the Sun, starring Golshifteh Farahani and Emmanuelle Bercot. Farahani plays a Kurdish fighter leading an all-female battalion called Daughters of the Sun, who is about to retake her hometown, once captured by Isis Bercot plays the French journalist who meets her there.The Lebanese actor and director Nadine Labaki is known for elegant comic dramas like Caramel and Where Do We Go Now?. She is in competition this year with Capernaum, another Lebanese-set drama, using mostly non-professionals, about a boy who rebels against the life imposed on him and launches a lawsuit. Capernaum is the village in Israel where Jesus is said to have taught in the synagogue and healed the sick.Yomeddine is a road movie by the Egyptian-Austrian film-maker Abu Bakr Shawky, about a middle-aged man raised in a leper colony who journeys across Egypt with an orphan boy whimsically named Obama, and a donkey, on a mission to reconnect with the family who abandoned him there as a child.

It is about tension and transgression, and yet also succeeds in evoking a pure and miraculous calm. The German film-maker Valeska Grisebach leads you gently by the hand along her drama’s meandering path into a grove of mystery. She never allows you to make assumptions about the good guys and bad guys, doesn’t confect the obvious confrontations and crises that another type of film would consider necessary, and doesn’t coerce the audience into consenting to the inevitability of violence.A bored bunch of German construction workers show up in the remote, mountainous and stunningly beautiful region of southwestern Bulgaria to build a hydroelectric power station, evidently with EU money. But there is a serious problem with the job: the site manager has been inadequately briefed about the terrain there is no regular water supply to make the concrete and the gravel they paid for hasn’t arrived. Work grinds to a halt and the men have little to do but lounge around in the sun, drinking beer, boorishly flying the German flag from their camp and making leering, arrogant advances to the women from the village, while antagonising the local men.Meinhard Neumann plays Meinhard, a quiet, ruminative worker. He is competent, hardworking, avoids idiotic behaviour, and has a respectful and open-minded attitude to the local people he is nicknamed the Legionnaire on account of supposed military service in Iraq and Afghanistan, although the truth about this is never quite clear. Reinhardt Wetrek plays the boss, Vincent, an arrogant and swaggering type who insults one of the local women, Vyara (Vyara Borisova), but then, in the most excruciatingly poignant and vulnerable way, appears to have feelings for her. Syuleyman Alilov Letifov plays Adrian, a Bulgarian man who befriends Meinhard and even hires him as his unofficial bodyguard at the gravel quarry he manages.The title sports with the idea of genre. It is, of course, like a Hollywood western, with a military-style fort set up in the middle of Apache country and a question of tribal loyalty involved in fraternisation. But there is another genre: pastoral. For all the simmering resentment and sexual tension, the Germans and Bulgarians, with their quarrels and intrigues, occupy an almost Edenic world of natural beauty. Reinhardt tells Adrian that it is “paradise”, especially when he takes him to the fabled and awe-inspiring rock formation in nearby Sarnitsa that is a promontory in the shape of a face in profile.Their water problem is down to the fact that it has to be rationed between three local villages, switching the supply with a hidden valve. Reinhardt takes and tames one of the local wild horses – an appropriation that annoys the villagers, until they see his heartfelt love of the animal – but then this horse is to become fatefully involved in Vincent’s duplicity and his arrogant plan to steal the locals’ water. It is a micro-tragedy that becomes weirdly reminiscent of Thomas Hardy’s story Our Exploits at West Poley.“Western” doesn’t just allude to the American west. In some ways, it is naturally a parable of neo-colonial adventure and the toxic masculinity and loneliness that involves. The prosperous west high-handedly imposes its commercial and political will on the undeveloped territories. The German workers sneeringly insist they are basically doing these backward Bulgarians a favour they don’t deserve. But even this interpretation isn’t quite right. These two European tribes seem to have a lot in common, and the explosion of violence – which could occupy the third act of almost any other sort of film, from Euro arthouse shocker to Hollywood thriller – never arrives as you might expect. The energies and passions are always erted and dissipated in surprising ways. It is more a western-on-western culture clash, one that turns out to be more of a meeting of minds in which people work very hard to get past the language barrier and communicate in good faith. And Neumann’s performance is quietly compelling. Grisebach has not, in fact, made many movies her two other feature credits are a love story Longing (2006), and her schooldays drama Be My Star (2001). But on the strength of this one, she deserves to be a considered a major film-maker."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/395aa50b4567d35cfa91c679b0a055c393b00852/0_94_2169_1301/master/2169.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=240175595bb5b4e70c8b395a8a9b468c 1240w","title":"whats the secret to the rocks success","story":"Dwayne Johnson, star of the newly released blockbuster Rampage, is the world’s biggest movie star. Could his Crossrail-tunnel-proportioned arms take him even further?Dwayne Johnson is big. Really big. The WWE wrestler-turned-Hollywood star is 6ft 4in, a solid 250lb-worth of hunk – a muscular alpha monument of a guy, much like the “Brahma bull” logo which he has tattooed on to one of his Crossrail-tunnel-proportioned arms.Yet his shaven head, which he has sported for some years now, also gives him a kind of Buddha-like calm to go with the bulk, an easy geniality that makes him castable in family adventures and action comedies. Aged 45, he is up at 5am every day to work out for at least a couple of hours, a regime he inherited from his dad, Rocky Johnson, himself a professional wrestler, from whom Johnson adapted his wrestling name – The Rock. Johnson is of impeccable wrestling lineage. His Samoan grandfather, Peter Maivia, was a legend among wrestling fans.And Johnson is big in another way. He is now simply the world’s biggest movie star. In 2015, his films reportedly made $1.488bn at the box office . In an industry which desperately needs tentpole stars and above-the-title players, people whose simple presence can “open” a movie, Johnson is a prince. As he today opens his new, outrageously silly extravaganza, Rampage, Johnson is entering his celebrity prime, now confident enough to discuss his problems with depression, his tough upbringing and the agony of witnessing his mother’s attempt at taking her own life after they were evicted from their apartment when he was a teenager.But how did this happen? What exactly has he done? Has he ever made any good films? It is difficult to pin down quite what roles Johnson has made his own. Arnie had The Terminator, Sylvester had Rambo and Rocky, Bruce had Die Hard and, these days, Tom has Mission: Impossible. But Dwayne isn’t like that, and he’s not a classic action star, either. He has spread his career and brand identity into a wider portfolio of genres and franchise properties, and the return on these has collectively added up to a colossal amount of celebrity clout.Like Arnie with Conan the Barbarian, Johnson began by parleying his muscles into a “mythic” role. He was The Scorpion King in 2002, a role spun off from his small part in The Mummy Returns the year before. Johnson made action movies such as The Rundown in 2003 and the not-much-liked Doom in 2005, based on a video game. He had a brief and very surreal flirtation with auteur-arthouse, making his debut at the Cannes film festival in Richard Kelly’s cult movie Southland Tales in 2007, alongside Seann William Scott. But his career takeoff really came at the end of the decade, when he made his debut in the fifth movie in the petrolhead Fast and Furious franchise, playing Luke Hobbs, the Government agent dedicated to taking on Vin Diesel’s daredevil criminal Dominic “Dom” Toretto. Johnson siphoned off the huge popularity of these movies into his own career petrol tank. But he also played the lead in Disney’s Race To Witch Mountain, the action-adventure remake of the 1975 film Escape To Witch Mountain. And if you’ve got tweenage children and they’ve ever had a sleepover, with a DVD being put on, then you will have witnessed the awesome power of this film. Johnson is a lovable dad.His secret is that he didn’t go down the pure action route, still less the “Hulk” blind alley suffered by someone like, say, Lou Ferrigno. Like Arnie, he is self-aware and good-natured enough to play comedy and family-oriented movies – but, unlike Arnie, it wasn’t a matter of irony or sending himself up. With his open, wide-eyed face and unassuming, essentially unaggressive persona, he could carry it off. And he can be funny — developing a genuinely successful odd-couple double-act with the standup Kevin Hart in the films Central Intelligence and Jumani: Welcome To The Jungle. They are like Schwarzenegger and DeVito in Twins. He is the action Dean Martin to Kevin’s Jerry Lewis. He is also working on a double-act spinoff from Fast and Furious with Jason Statham, and he cheerfully declares they will be called “Dwaytham”.For Johnson, being a nice guy is a central part of his persona. But it wasn’t always like this. As a college football star at the University of Miami, he had a ferocious temper, and was always getting into fights. In his wrestling career in the 90s and early 00s, Johnson was originally cast as the “heel”, the bad guy, always trash-talking and insulting his opponents – including that other wrestler-turned-actor, John Cena. And even now, in his movie career, we have seen flashes of Johnson’s dark side. “Vin and I had a few discussions, including an important face-to-face in my trailer,” Johnson icily told Rolling Stone of an incident during the filming of Fast and Furious. “And what I came to realise is that we have a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach movie-making and collaborating.” Quite a paraphrase.For the moment, The Rock is the colossus of the industry. Will he progress to something more solid? Does he even need to? As he grows into character roles, Johnson might have something bigger to show us before he taps out. He has spoken about how he hopes one day to host the Oscars … maybe even win an Oscar. And, last May, while hosting Saturday Night Live, he announced his bid for the US presidency in 2020, with Tom Hanks as his running mate. Of course, he was just kidding. Or was he?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/744724dab64b26b0a50d319006fb28531633296e/0_33_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1aa55178f48e284cfef4efade6f57330 1240w","title":"six of the most dramatic nights european cup champions league","story":"The almost shocking conclusion to what had been a notable Juventus recovery against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu has not only ided opinion – it was a penalty all day long, one could only admire the stealth with which Medhi Benatia administered his shove in the back of Lucas Vázquez and the bravery of Michael Oliver for punishing it – but has also inspired much talk of the evening being one of the most dramatic in the history of the European Cup and Champions League. However the latter stages of the competition have frequently produced controversy, spectacle and drama. Here are six other notable European nights to consider.Comebacks do not come any more unexpected or spellbinding than this. Call it the greatest of escapes, the miracle of Istanbul or just the ultimate games of two halves but the fact is the first half was so embarrassingly one-sided that some Liverpool supporters are said to have attempted to leave the stadium during the interval, only to find the gates locked. Cue a little tactical adjustment by Rafa Benítez, who brought on Didi Hamann for the second half, and heroic performances by Steven Gerrard and Jerzy Dudek, and Liverpool recovered a three-goal deficit, negotiated extra-time and then won on penalties. Unforgettable.Almost certainly the height of European injustice, as the Norwegian referee Tom Henning Øvrebø waved away four reasonable Chelsea penalty appeals before a 90th-minute goal from Andrés Iniesta swept Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona into the final with their only shot on target. One of the most memorable images of the night was Michael Ballack sprinting half the length of the pitch while remonstrating with the hapless official, before Didier Drogba’s sweary rant to the camera at full-time earned him a five-match ban. Øvrebø apologised some years later but it was far too late to earn Guus Hiddink the shot at Manchester United in Rome he so craved.Barcelona were at the height of their supremacy under Guardiola in 2010 but Inter arrived at the Camp Nou with a 3-1 lead from the first leg. The visitors soon went down to 10 men when Thiago Motta was dismissed in the first half but what followed was a defensive masterclass, more organisation than improvisation, as Inter virtually abandoned attack to concentrate their resources on stopping Barcelona from scoring again. This was peak José Mourinho who, after outwitting Guardiola while short-handed, was presented with few problems by Louis van Gaal’s Bayern Munich in the final. Perennial underachievers in Europe, Inter had suddenly landed the treble of the Serie A title, Coppa Italia and Champions League.A 10-goal final certainly sounds dramatic, even if the distribution of goals suggests the showpiece might have been a tad one-sided. In Britain at least, this felt like it was the moment when the European Cup came of age, when the scales fell from insular eyes and the attraction of continental competition was suddenly grasped. The final provided royal entertainment for an immense Hampden Park crowd of 127,621, an audience that seemingly included – just like the Sex Pistols at the Free Trade Hall or the Velvet Underground’s first LP – a great many people who would later be inspired to achievements of their own. If this was football, Britain wanted more.Strange as it might seem now, it came as news to the nation at large to discover there was something intoxicatingly special about European nights at Anfield. Liverpool under Bob Paisley were breaking new ground – in Bill Shankly’s time the club had never been synonymous with European success – and when the French champions scored an away goal the home side needed two more to progress. Thanks in part to a hugely partisan crowd, Ray Kennedy and David “supersub” Fairclough they got them, though knowing what we know now the most arresting sight of the evening was the spilling, seething, all-standing Kop.“Football: bloody hell,” as someone said. The last part of United’s treble was undramatic in normal time – an under-strength side appeared to possess neither the wit nor the will to cancel out Mario Basler’s early goal. The most famous three minutes of stoppage time in history changed all that, however. The substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer added one late goal and then another to leave the opposing defenders on the floor in dismay. The Uefa president Lennart Johansson had to remove Bayern’s ribbons from the trophy before presenting it. “I can’t believe it,” he said. “The winners are crying and the losers are dancing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fea2f83e9637b733952deb12fb8e38dfd97afa/1563_178_2437_1462/master/2437.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39eaf0a11bc5571ca07dfcdfbc5b5e52 1240w","title":"the fiver gianluigi buffon juventus real madrid","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!Weird Uncle Fiver has been trying to piece together fragments of his memory again. He’s attempting to recall the moral of an incident that happened in February 2012 in a match involving Juventus and Milan. The details have become murky in the fug of time and Tin. Sulley Muntari definitely sent in a header that crossed the line by about two yards before the goalkeeper clawed it back and claimed a heroic save. Muntari certainly wheeled away in celebration at putting his team 2-0 up. And Weird Uncle Fiver recalls with great fondness the looks of perplexity on the faces of the officials, who had no idea whether a goal had really been scored. The ref decided to wave play on and hoped it wouldn’t matter much. But Juve later equalised and went on to pip Milan to the Serie A title. What Weird Uncle Fiver can’t quite recollect is who the goalkeeper was that day. It couldn’t have been Gigi Buffon, could it? Why, yes it was! “I thought he was a champion of fairness,” drawled Muntari back in the day. “It was all moving so quickly that I didn’t realise the ball had crossed the line,” claimed Buffon before adding: “But even if I had realised, I certainly wouldn’t have helped the referee!” Funny how things pan out. Fast forward to Wednesday night’s Big Cup quarter-final at the Bernabéu, and there was Buffon, pawing at a referee seven years younger than him and pleading for help like a motorist who’s been given a ticket for overstaying his allotted parking time by three minutes. He pleaded with such force, in fact, that traffic warden Michael Oliver felt obliged to send him off. “To award such a doubtful, or super doubtful, penalty just ahead of the final whistle and destroy the work of a team who gave absolutely everything you have to have a rubbish bin instead of your heart,” stormed Buffon later, as Muntari began wondering which emoji he could send to best capture this moment.Others, meanwhile, began breaking down Buffon’s grievance and aren’t going to stop any time soon. As far as The Fiver can make out, Buffon’s complaint is based on two contradictory standards. On one hand the goalkeeper suggested that Oliver’s late twist was a case of a ref being too pernickety, awarding a spot-kick for a challenge by Medhi Benatia that may not have been a foul. On the other, Buffon lambasts the man in the middle for not being fastidious enough. Oliver failed, apparently, to factor in the effort that Juve deployed to recover from a three-goal first-leg deficit. That’s some can of worms Buffon is cracking open there. Should Oliver’s decision have been influenced by the fact that Marcelo was lax in closing down Matteo De Sciglio before the cross that led to Juve’s second goal? Should the relative amounts of energy dispensed by each team in the warm-ups also be taken into account or should refs only start keeping track of effort levels after kick-off? Should they have access to match analysis data just to check whether a player has run enough to really deserve a free-kick after being fouled? Can VAR software be updated to include all these new parameters in time for the World Cup? Oh, and here’s another question. Would one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time have enhanced his legendary status by saving His added-time penalty if, that is, he hadn’t blown his top and got himself sent off?

All that and it came down to this: 180 minutes reduced to a single moment. A 3-0 victory for Real Madrid in Turin, 3-0 to Juventus in Madrid and then, in the 93rd and final minute, with 39 remaining seconds that would soon be considerably more, Lucas Vázquez went down, nudged by Mehdi Benatia. So here they were, a semi-final waiting, everyone watching two men standing 12 yards apart at the north end of the Santiago Bernabéu. Well eventually. One shot but a long time to take it. Juventus surrounded the referee and Gigi Buffon was sent off.“The referee had a rubbish bin where his heart should be,” Buffon said, while Vázquez insisted: “It’s a penalty, the centre-back arrives and bundles me over. But in a situation like that the protests are normal, it’s the last minute after a great game.” Ronaldo thought differently. “I don’t know why they were protesting but football’s like that,” he said. As he left the stadium, he and Buffon embraced. They had not seen each other when the moment came. Buffon walked Wojciech Szczesny came on to replace him. All the while, Ronaldo waited.Szczesny had no time to warm up, no touch of the ball. Ronaldo, who admitted “the minutes before taking the penalty felt eternal”, had it. Szczesny headed on to his line, where he jumped up and down pushing the bar, making it wobble. Ronaldo, still standing there, took a deep breath and then another, as if trying to force both lungs out with the air that had filled them. He was not the only one. Eventually he began his run, Dani Carvajal way behind him, on his knees and unable to look. The clock had said 92min 21sec when Vázquez went down by the time Ronaldo struck the penalty it was 96.55.The nerves he admitted to having were not visible, the ball flying into the top corner – his 15th goal in the competition this season, at least one in every match – and the stadium erupting. “Where does the fear go when it escapes your body?” Jorge Bustos asked in El Mundo. There was a lot of it rushing out. It had been there – “somewhere between your intestines and your throat”, Bustos reckoned – from the start to the end.Comebacks form part of Madrid’s legend, encapsulated in the phrase uttered by the forward Juanito in 1986. Madrid had been beaten 3-1 by Internazionale in the first leg of a Uefa Cup tie but Juanito warned that the second leg would be different, saying in cod Italian: “Noventa minuti en el Bernabéu son molto longo.” Ninety minutes in the Bernabéu are very long. It was supposed to apply to opponents, not Madrid, but here it was reversed. These 90 minutes were molto, molto longo indeed.When Juventus scored their first, one minute 16 seconds had gone and it was 8.47pm when Madrid scored their first, finally ending it, it was 10.40pm. An hour and 53 minutes of suffering and then an explosion. Somehow they had found a way through. On the front of the sports daily AS, the headline said: “From panic to the semi-final.” Madrid had escaped thanks to a “miracle”. In El Mundo, Orfeo Suárez saw Madrid still “on course for their Holy Grail, like Christ resurrected. Cristiano, taking his place standing there in the form of a cross, was as implacable in applying punishment as he was suffering in martyrdom.” Suffering was the word. “Journalists are supposed to say things like: ‘How lovely football is,’” Bustos wrote. “Lovely? Bollocks.”That is football, though. “There’s not much chance,” Max Allegri had said before the match but Zinedine Zidane insisted: “In football any team can mess things up for you in one move.” He said so even before Barcelona had been knocked out in Rome, and that result came as a timely reminder. Sergio Ramos’s brother, René, used a Spanish phrase that roughly translates: “When you see your neighbour’s beard shaved off, prepare the shaving foam for yours.” In other words, be warned: what happened to them could happen to you. Watching from the tunnel, suspended, the younger Ramos saw how right he had been. Yet no one had expected anything quite like this, the biggest home defeat Madrid had suffered in this competition.“Did I think we were going to suffer? Yes. What I didn’t expect was for us to concede in the first minute,” Zidane admitted. “I knew they would pressure us, their coach prepared a great plan and they played a great game. But we didn’t expect a goal after one minute your head goes down and you give them life.” Juventus reached for it, Madrid clung to it. El Mundo made a play on the chant: “That’s how Madrid win” with a headline that read: “That’s how Madrid suffer.”Vázquez said: “This was a lesson in football. If you relax or you’re not focused every minute, there is no pardon.” But there was, and this is the way Madrid win, too. They always seem to find a way. They have been under pressure in recent years but progressed they have trailed and come back they have been bad, as well as good, and won. And despite the warning – perhaps because of the warning? – this will only reinforce the feeling that Zidane’s side are on course for a third Champions League in a row.“We knew how to suffer and that goal put us in the semi-final,” Vázquez added. “Juventus forgot that in Europe you have to kill Madrid six times,” Marca wrote. “Football changes, Real Madrid remain: the essence of the Champions League,” said Santiago Siguero.Manuel Jabois wrote in El País: “The Champions League is a competition in which there are not home and away ties but two slaughterhouses in which it’s not always the cleanest man who survives. That’s why Madrid, a terrorised, trembling team, naked and surrendering, waiting for extra-time like a bullet in the head, won. Juventus passed over Madrid Madrid, as ever, passed through to the next round. Because of a striker in a trance, a mad man who put the ball on the spot and faced a substitute goalkeeper, then sent a missile into the top corner in the last moment, which is the only way to go into a European Cup semi-final. In the end, Madrid is always everything.”Ronaldo said: “We suffered and we have to learn. Nobody gives you anything and you have to fight to the end.” But when the end came, standing there alone, it was no longer time to fight it was time to breathe, steady his heart and take the shot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e9e467018b7b1f6af00825f85821e6149743247/0_4_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=55b7dc433ec4d56ac639d74890e89f9e 1240w","title":"we do not need playstation 5 in 2018","story":"There are rumours Sony is about to make a big hardware announcement – but it hasn’t wrung the last drops out of PlayStation 4 yetIt has begun. Rumours regarding a possible successor to the PlayStation 4 have been swirling around tech sites and forums for several days, prompting a few bites from larger news outlets. According to some sources, we could see the PlayStation 5 as soon as this winter.It all started last month, when games writer Marcus Sellars posted a tweet suggesting that PS5 development kits were already being sent out to studios around the world. This was followed last week by subscription-only site Semiaccurate.com claiming to have seen technical details of the machine. According to its report, the PS5 will be based around an AMD accelerated processing unit featuring the manufacturer’s next generation Navi-series GPU and its Zen 2 CPU. These specifications align with a speculative news piece on the Japanese news site PC Watch, posted last June, but while that story predicted a PS5 launch date of 2019 or 2020, the Semiaccurate story states that a 2018 release is technically feasible. Historically, five years has been a sweet spot for developers on Sony’s machines – it’s enough time to have produced a couple of titles, learned the hardware inside out, and developed tricks and techniques to squeeze every pixel out of the graphics processor. It was five years after the launch of the original PlayStation that we got Gran Turismo 2, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, Driver and Spider-Man: titles that really pushed the 3D graphics architecture. It was five years after the arrival of PlayStation 2 that we got God of War, Shadow of the Colossus, Final Fantasy XII, Bully and Black for the PS3 it was Uncharted 3, Skyrim, Dark Souls and Batman: Arkham City. The consoles were still being pushed at that point, still throwing up new possibilities.True, things are a little different this time. After the hugely complex PS3 Cell processor, which confounded developers for many months, Sony specifically designed PlayStation 4 to let studios get up and running relatively quickly, using a PC-based architecture and involving developers in the design process.However, system architect Mark Cerny also added flexibility into the design to ensure that, from mid-life, developers would have some wiggle room, including the use of the graphics processor to perform other game calculations. Speaking to Gamasutra in 2013, he said: “Our belief is that by the middle of the PlayStation 4 console lifetime, asynchronous compute is a very large and important part of games technology.” He talked about a dozen programs running simultaneously on the GPU and using it to perform physics and collision computations, adding extra depth to the simulation. So even now, we may not be seeing the absolute limits of the hardware.Look at the PS4 this year, and it is clearly not a console in creative or technical decline. God of War and Monster Hunter: World are astonishing, and later we’ll see Spider-Man, Detroit: Become Human, Days Gone, The Last of Us Part II and (eventually) Death Stranding. All of these are pushing forward in the areas you’d expect – environmental fidelity, lighting complexity, character modelling – and, more important, they’re doing fresh, interesting things with the hardware, whether that’s exploring new forms of narrative realism or developing AI mass flocking behaviours.Another facet of the current rumours is that virtual reality technology will be an intrinsic part of the PlayStation 5 offering – perhaps via a new dedicated AMD VR chipset. But we’re really not in a place where consumer virtual reality is living up to the hype and excitement generated when Oculus Rift first emerged. The headsets remain bulky, the experiences are limited. Sony may have sold over a million PS VR units, but how many people are regularly using them? Yet maybe, with a couple of years of extra development – both in terms of hardware and game design philosophy – we might be somewhere much more interesting we might be in a place where designers can show us what this uniquely immersive technology can achieve.Sony is winning the console war against Xbox in terms of sales and first-party development it doesn’t need to rush to the end of this cycle. There is an irresistible forward momentum in the games industry, and of course, everyone loves the drama and excitement when some shiny new box is looming on the horizon. But winter 2018 is too soon. Heck, 2019 is too soon. But the year after, with a new generation of processors in place and a couple more years more to get the hang of VR? Well, 2020 does have a nice ring to it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43aa1715ad36aee694d4fbbe76f809d5039da2fe/1345_1100_3791_3792/master/3791.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=57f8294da13d2768d2d11ba93f86e11f 1240w","title":"felicity cloake masterclass mayonnaise recipe","story":"Back away from the shop-bought stuff and make a mayo to remember with these easy stepsWith a few exceptions, commercial mayonnaise is to homemade as processed cheese is to mature cheddar – convenient, but hard to get excited about. Proper mayo, gently wobbly and yolk-yellow, is a quite different beast: too good to hide away in a sandwich, it deserves to be the star of the show, served with crunchy baby veg, fresh seafood or just a big pile of hot, salty chips.1 egg yolk1 big pinch salt1 tbsp dijon mustard1 tbsp white-wine or cider vinegar, or lemon juice250ml light olive, grape seed, sunflower or other neutral oil25ml extra-virgin olive, walnut or rapeseed oilEnsure everything is at room temperature before you get going. This makes the finished product much less likely to split. So, if you keep your eggs in the fridge, take them out at least 30 minutes before you start work.This small amount of mayonnaise is hard to make in most food mixers, but electric beaters will do the trick, as will a whisk and a bit of elbow grease. You will also need a large, sturdy bowl. If you happen to have a stick blender and a tall jug in which it fits snugly, go to step 7.Put a damp cloth under the bowl to anchor it, then put the egg yolk and salt in the bowl. Whisk for about 20 seconds, until slightly thickened, then add the mustard and acid (and a teaspoon of cold water if you’re nervous, though it’s not strictly necessary). Whisk for another 30 seconds. Familiarise yourself with step 6 before going any further.Begin to add the oil into the bowl, drop by painstaking drop, whisking all the time. Don’t be tempted to use extra-virgin olive oil, because this will make a heavy, often bitter mayonnaise, especially if you’re using electric beaters. It’s far better, and cheaper, to start with a neutral oil and add some extra-virgin at the end.Keep whisking and pouring until the mayonnaise begins to thicken, at which point you can begin to add the oil more quickly, followed by a second, more flavourful oil, if you like. Once all 275ml of the oil has been incorporated and you have a thick, glossy mixture, season to taste. If you’d prefer a thinner consistency, beat in a little water, lemon juice or vinegar.If your mayonnaise splits, it’s easily rescued, as long as you have another egg yolk. Crack this into a fresh bowl, whisk for a minute until thick and sticky, then gradually beat in the split mayonnaise a little at a time, followed by any remaining oil.If you have a stick blender, put all the ingredients except the extra-virgin olive oil into a jug just slightly wider than the blender head. Plunge the blender down to the base of the jug, then turn on and, keeping the blender still, blend on high power for 10 seconds, until you can see the mixture start to emulsify.Once the mayonnaise begins to billow out from the sides of the blender, very slowly move the head upwards through the oil until you have a creamy mayonnaise (repeat this process, if necessary). Beat in the extra-virgin olive oil by hand, then season to taste.Mayonnaise is easy to tailor to need or occasion: fold in a clove of crushed garlic, or a handful of chopped herbs, the zest of an unwaxed lemon, black pepper, chilli sauce, horseradish or wasabi, smoked paprika and lime juice, crumbled blue cheese and chives, curry powder, finely chopped capers anchovies or cornichons, wholegrain mustard – but preferably not all at once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb8e4245e683c703eb722af6978719efdb671cdf/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4d6db19fddb35dd028bc204a07afcc5f 2600w","title":"ultra processed truth 10 bestselling foods cherry bakewell fray bentos pies","story":"From Cherry Bakewells to Fray Bentos pies, do we really understand the cocktail of ingredients in our favourite brands? Nutritionists assess them – and just what they might mean for our healthAs the saying goes: if your granny wouldn’t have recognised what’s in it, it’s probably not real food. Yet half the food we take home is made in factories from a list of ingredients and additives as long as your arm, most of which never found a place in any grandparents’ kitchen cupboard – and wouldn’t in yours or mine today.We are a nation of ultra-processed-food eaters. Our lives have become too fast-paced to cook from scratch and our tastebuds now crave the sweet and salty flavours that ultra-processed foods deliver. Our bread is fluffy and sticks to the teeth like candyfloss. Our yoghurts are super-sweet and creamy. We have ready meals that are shelf-stable (long life without refrigeration), which we can prise open, heat, eat and go.Nutritionists are alarmed. The ultra-processed foods we tend to eat now are calorie-dense and a major contribution to obesity. They have also been stripped of bioactive compounds such as phytoestrogens and fibre, which we know are good for us. All we get is calories (and occasionally added vitamins). And although inidually they are all approved for safety, we have no idea what effect the cocktail of additives might have on us in the long term.The nutritionist Dr Courtney Scott from the Food Foundation says it costs less to fill up hungry kids on ultra-processed foods than fresh. “For £1 worth of spinach, say, you can get 60 calories. For £1 worth of apples you get 307 calories. For £1 of turkey dinosaurs, you’re getting 730 calories. It is not surprising that the foods that are palatable – they are full of salt and sugar and fat – and that are calorie-rich for a low price are the ones that we’re consuming the most of,” she says.A group of international scientists has produced what they call the Nova definition of four classes of food, from fruit and vegetables in their natural state to ultra-processed, which are, they say, “industrial formulations typically with five or more and usually many ingredients”. These include “substances not commonly used in culinary preparations”, and contain additives “whose purpose is to imitate sensory qualities” of natural foods such as fruit. They are, says Prof Carlos Monteiro from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, “intrinsically unhealthy”.His collaborator Prof Jean-Claude Moubarac, from the department of nutrition at the University of Montreal, Canada, goes further. These foods cause social and cultural damage, he says. “They promote overconsumption and a relationship to food that is characterised by compulsion, stress and anxiety.”We looked at what is actually in 10 of Britain’s favourites, choosing a top seller from 10 categories of packaged foods tracked by Euromonitor International. What is the country eating?Bernard Matthews did not respond to requests for comment.Scott says she did a double take at this list of ingredients. “Unfortunately, there is no chicken or mushroom in the chicken and mushroom sauce. There is chicken fat and there is mushroom juice concentrate,” she says. The mushroom juice concentrate will have had the fibre and vegetable micronutrients pounded out of it in the industrial process.Premier Foods, which makes Batchelors and also Mr Kipling cakes, says: “Processing plays a very important role in food safety and preservation. We recognise the importance of healthy lifestyles and balanced choices, and continually work on developing increasingly healthy and convenient options for consumers, as well as having an increased focus on positive nutrients such as fibre and protein.”Drying foods was one of the oldest preservation methods, they say. “Batchelors Pasta ’n’ Sauce is low in fat, has no added MSG and no artificial colours or preservatives.”A gold star for anyone who knows how surimi is made. It does contain Alaska pollock – but not whole slices or chunks of fish, just the protein it is fish that has been mechanically beaten and pulverised to a paste. As it is tasteless and shapeless, sugar is added, followed by a host of additives – two forms of starch and some shellfish bits and flavour enhancers – so it can be formed into a solid, fishy-tasting stick.Young’s said it would not be able to comment.There is no veg. “Fresh foods rich in bioactive compounds (flavonoids, for instance), including onions, garlic and other foods used in freshly prepared dishes are absent from these products,” says Monteiro. “Being ready-to-eat products, it is unlikely they will be consumed with fresh foods that usually need preparation. On the contrary, one ultra-processed food tends to be consumed with other ultra-processed foods.”Xanthan gum is not from an exotic tree. It is fermented sugar. The name comes from the type of bacteria used. It is a stabiliser to bind together ingredients such as fat and water that would otherwise repel each other.Fray Bentos did not respond to requests for comment.“As far as we’re concerned, the industrial loaf with all its additives isn’t actually bread,” says Chris Young of the Real Bread Campaign. It is calling for an Honest Crust Act to legally define “sourdough”, “artisan”, “wholegrain” and “craft”, as well as “fresh” and “freshly baked”, and to make manufacturers list all their ingredients – some are left out on the basis that they are just part of the processing.The launch of the Chorleywood Process in 1961 changed the UK’s bread drastically. This was the discovery of how to go from a pile of flour to sliced, plastic-wrapped bread in three to four hours, using lower-protein wheat, vitamin C, fat, yeast and high-speed mixers. Bread gained additives, “relaxants to overcome the stress of the machine and then tighteners again”, Young says. “It was a milestone – or tombstone – in the history of bread.”A Warburtons spokesperson says bread is one of the UK’s main sources of dietary fibre. “It is misleading to consider mass-produced bread an ‘ultra-processed food’. We bake it fresh, every day, using the same methods you would at home. However, in order to meet demand and ensure that we are able to produce affordable products for our consumers, we do this on a much larger scale.”There is lots of sugar in this, predictably – and not just sugar (twice) but glucose-fructose syrup. Dried skimmed milk will also be sweet. The digestives also contain palm oil, much used in ultra-processed foods. “Health-wise, palm oil is not fantastic because it is a highly saturated fat. It is being used instead of trans fats, which used to be commonly found in this type of product,” says Scott. “From a nutritional perspective, we’ve swapped one particularly unhealthy fat for one that isn’t particularly good for you either.” There are also concerns about the environmental impact of farming and harvesting palm oil.McVitie’s says it provides transparent information so people can make healthy snacking choices. “Biscuits are simply baked by combining a few ingredients. They are a source of fibre and adhere to strict nutrition guardrails,” it says.A spokesman from Müller says: “We are fully aligned with the view that a balanced diet and lifestyle is important, but we also believe that it should be permissible for people to enjoy moments of pleasure, which is what this product offers.”Sugar is the second ingredient here – 11g per 30g serving. From a nutritional perspective, maize and sugar are going to be very quickly digested. There is not a lot of fibre to slow the process down, so you are likely to feel hungry sooner. “In addition to it being very sweet and reinforcing that sweet palate, nutritionally this isn’t going to stay with you for very long,” says Scott.Kellogg’s says it provides a variety of convenient, nutritious and high-quality foods, all of which can play a role in a healthy, balanced diet. “Multiple studies have shown that people who start the day with a cereal breakfast tend to weigh less and have improved nutrient intakes,” says a spokesperson, pointing to the added vitamins.Ingredients: flour (with added calcium, iron, niacin, thiamin), sugar, vegetable oils (palm, rapeseed), plum and raspberry jam (glucose-fructose syrup, plum puree, sugar, raspberry puree, gelling agent (pectin), acid (citric acid), acidity regulator (sodium citrates), colour (anthocyanins), preservative (potassium sorbate), flavouring), glucose syrup, glace cherries (cherries, sugar, acidity regulator (citric acid), preservatives (potassium sorbate, sulphur dioxide), colour (cochineal), sweetened condensed skimmed milk (skimmed milk, sugar), ground rice, desiccated coconut (contains preservative (sodium metabisulphite (sulphites), whey powder (milk), dried egg white, ground almonds, salt, dextrose, emulsifiers (sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60), raising agents (disodium diphosphate, sodium bicarbonate), milk proteins, humectant (vegetable glycerine), flavouring, preservative (potassium sorbate).“There’s a bit of flour and it’s fortified – OK. A tiny, tiny bit of fruit in the form of raspberry and plum puree. This is a far cry from eating a raspberry or a plum.”Premier Foods says: “Mr Kipling Cherry Bakewells contain no hydrogenated fats, and no artificial colours or flavours.”Cadbury has MILK in capitals on the Dairy Milk ingredients list, stressing that it has plenty of real milk as well as real cocoa solids in its chocolate. It also has emulsifiers and flavourings – as well as cheap palm oil – that you wouldn’t have in the kitchen cupboard. These are engineered to give the right silky mouthfeel for a chocolate bar.Cadbury did not respond to requests for comment.“In this environment, it’s really not surprising that we’ve ended up in the situation where half of our calories are coming from ultra-processed foods,” Scott says. Like other food campaigners, she wants TV advertising bans before 9pm and a clampdown on promotions – and some way of making healthy food as cheap as the factory-made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c507bb1354046ab8568890b7b3727fed8110d6e/0_596_4116_2470/master/4116.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=12266a8b48efdf76911992ec9db35e4e 2600w","title":"manic street preachers jobs meaning jeremy corbyn doesnt understand that resistance is useless","story":"Nicky Wire and James Dean Bradfield are seated in the latter’s hotel room in Marylebone, central London, ostensibly promoting the Manic Street Preachers’ forthcoming 14th album, Resistance Is Futile, but instead talking about the possibility of Manic Street Preachers splitting up. Wire says he finds the prospect “terrifying”, which is understandable: they have been in the band for 31 years – they formed at secondary school in Blackwood in south Wales – and neither of them seems to know what else they might do. “I can’t go and teach at the Cardiff Institute of Music, you know,” smiles Bradfield. “My first lecture on how to make it in the music business: ‘Piss everybody off, dress like your mum and learn how to play on the job.’ ‘Er … can we have a new lecturer, please?’”Nevertheless, they say, splitting up is a thought that has occurred to both of them in the four years since they last released an album, a trying period during which Wire’s elderly parents fell ill, his mother gravely so, and their Cardiff studio, Faster, was closed after the building that housed it was earmarked for redevelopment and demolished – its closure made the local news in Wales. The process of building a new one, Bradfield protests, turned him into “a low-rent version of what’s-his-fucking-name from Grand Designs”. “He would ring me up and go: ‘I’ve got a bit of bad news – steel prices have gone up,” sighs Wire, with the unmistakable air of a man who didn’t join a band in order to discuss supporting joists.To most observers, the Manics seem to have spent the past decade in the kind of creative Indian summer that has eluded most of their peers. They enjoyed their commercial zenith in the late 90s, when, as Wire disbelievingly points out, they were so big that a single such as The Masses Against the Classes, which opens with a sample of Noam Chomsky and ends with a quotation from Albert Camus’ book The Rebel, could knock Westlife’s Seasons in the Sun off No 1. If they have never recaptured that high point, the past 10 years have still come replete with gold albums, arena tours and critical acclaim. That last record, Futurology, in particular was widely hailed as one of the best records the band has made. But Bradfield says he has found himself wondering if the Manics still had an audience – an odd thing to worry about given the size of the venues they still play, but as he says, the band were always “fucking obsessed with a desire to be huge”.“It’s dictated by role models, icons, whatever you want to call them,” Wire says. “Music used to be the leader in terms of that, everything about the way we looked growing up was about searching out how to look like those kind of people. Now they’re getting it from avenues that I can’t comprehend why they’d want to.” He sighs. “The emptiness of it. Actually, I feel a certain sense of pity, because I think our youth was so definite and tangible and exciting and full of space to dream and magic and all those kind of ephemeral things. Whereas now, it’s just ratcheted at you at such a fucking speed. And we all know, because we’ve all got kids, and you try to kind of … not influence them, but pass on things that made your life magical, and they just seem completely fucking irrelevant. It’s not nostalgia, that’s a key thing it’s actually things just disappearing. It’s like the NME closing, that was the worst thing about it: it’s just another nail, telling you music is less relevant.” Nevertheless, he says, “the one thing I know for certain, in this world of absolute doubt and uncertainty, is that when the three of us get in the studio, there is still a magic there”.Hence they didn’t split up, and while Resistance Is Futile certainly doesn’t shy away from addressing the band’s doubts – they are there in everything from its title to its cover photo, featuring “one of the last samurai warriors – someone who knows his time is over thanks to the coming of the gun” – it arrives filled with brashly anthemic songs that deal in what Wire calls “ecstatic miserablism … effervescent melancholy”.The latter’s story keys into another of Wire’s obsessions about the internet era: that nothing is ever truly secret, that everyone’s lives are constantly documented and held up to public scrutiny. “One of the greatest things Francis Bacon ever said was that you self-realised,” he says. “There was a period of five years in his life, literally no one knows what the fuck he did. He destroyed everything he painted, there were rumours he was an interior decorator, he was in Berlin … Just no one knows what went on for that period, and that can never happen again, that self-realisation where you really form yourself through isolation and scarcity and ideas. I actually feel sorry for the generations coming after us, because of that. How can you do it? Everything is there, laid out for you to be embarrassed by when you’re older, without realising. All our embarrassing songs that we wrote when we were 15, you know, thank fuck no one heard them. So there’s humiliation, as well, that idea of one false step … If you look back at me and Richey at the start, fuck me, we’d have been killed today. I dread to think what I would have put James and Sean through, because some of the interviews are just … there’s so much talk, and it’s only by the end that we talk any sense. But that was the process, wasn’t it, of just going through all that stuff.”There is also a considerable amount of fretting about politics, which seems faintly surprising: given the band’s past political allegiances to Tony Benn and Arthur Scargill, I had assumed they would be quite gung-ho for Jeremy Corbyn, but apparently not. “I’m coming around to him a lot more, but not gung-ho, no,” says Bradfield. “I’m not one of those people that goes on about the liberal elite in London, but I don’t think he understands what makes the working classes tick outside of London and that is just hardcore industries. We’ve operated at our optimum as people when jobs give us meaning, and in the post-industrial hinterlands, he doesn’t understand that. I remember somebody at a meeting down in south Wales, an old guy, ex-miner, wanted his son to have a proper, real, blue-collar job, and he was saying: ‘What do you expect us to do, Mr Corbyn, make fucking love spoons out of hemp?’ I don’t think Jezza gets it, I don’t think he connects with people on that level, which is part of the reason we’re having political problems in Wales.”Wire says he’s “completely baffled by my own political vacuum” since Brexit: “A lot of it’s just about political intelligence, the frustration where I think we grew up in a time when there was a lot of political intelligence on both sides, to be honest. Now … there’s never any answers, it’s just statement after statement of opposing vitriol, you know, which I just … I just can’t see a middle way at the moment.”And Bradfield and Wire go off on a lengthy tangent about politics: they talk, as much to each other as to me, about Tony Benn’s notion of the EU as “a gentleman’s club for millionaires” and how the remain campaign failed because it didn’t make enough of the EU’s failings and the need to reform it, whether or not the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is “an old-school totalitarian communist” (this, I should point out, is a phrase Wire uses with approval, rather than censure), and the proposed 2016 closure of the Tata steelworks in Port Talbot. They don’t, it has to be said, sound much like an irrelevant band stuck for things to say.“There is a sense of a massive fun and excitement being in our band,” says Wire. “Every record we’ve made recently, whether you like them or not, they’ve all been convincing. It’s still full of vitality. You can’t really fake that. We have to be completely committed to this.” He smiles. “At our age, if you’re not, then it’s fucking over.”Resistance is Futile is released on Columbia on 13 April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d103652896b7c26bde9ab1fef561937b290dbe96/0_87_2296_1605/master/2296.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=63693012519bcf7b80c9ce96697da5f9 1400w","title":"scientists solve mystery of how giants causeway was formed","story":"Volcanologists use samples from Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland to recreate famous hexagonal columns in laboratoryAccording to legend, the Giant’s Causeway was built by the Irish giant, Finn MacCool, as a crossing to confront his Scottish rival. Scientists have an alternative explanation, and for the first time they have reproduced in the laboratory the process through which the causeway’s 40,000 near-perfect hexagonal columns were formed.Geometric columns are seen in a variety of volcanic rocks across the Earth and are known to form as the rock cools and contracts, resulting in a regular array of polygonal prisms or columns. But until now, geologists had been unsure of the threshold at which cooling magma suddenly fractures into a geometric pavement.To answer the question, Lavallée and colleagues recreated the process in the laboratory using basalt cores drilled from the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland. The 20cm-long cylinders, gripped by a clamp at each end, were heated to more than 1,000C until they began to soften into lava. The samples were fixed at each end in a mechanical grip and cooled to test at what point they snapped.The basalt magma fractured at between 840-890C, the study found, suggesting that this is the temperature at which the Giant’s Causeway would have formed.“I have spent over a decade pondering how to address this question and construct the right experiment to find the answer to this question,” said Lavallée. “Now, with this study, we have found that the answer is hot, but after it solidified.”In the future, he hopes to extend the investigation by using a large pool of magma to reproduce the geometric fracturing as rock is cooled – although he said such an experiment would need to be performed under carefully controlled conditions.The Giant’s Causeway formed between 50 and 60 million years ago, when the region that now sits on the Antrim coastline was subject to intense volcanic activity. Molten basalt erupted through chalk beds and formed a lake of lava. As this cooled and contracted, cracks propagated across the plateau to form hexagonal stepping stones. Similar geological structures are seen elsewhere in the world, including Devils Postpile in the US, and the pattern occurs on many scales because faster cooling produces smaller columns.The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4025f575946770ed80dadc5fa8028daec869494b/0_64_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d95f30666b630b332863202f0878c0f1 1240w","title":"all women rallye aicha des gazelles du maroc","story":"The world’s largest all-female motorsport competition draws women from across the globe to the western Sahara desert. Welcome to the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles du MarocOver the course of an average year, the Sahara desert plays host to a wide variety of automotive sporting events, but none like the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles du Maroc.The off-road rallies typically held in this vast, desolate automotive playground utilize modern GPS and mapping technology, last only a couple of days and predominantly, if not entirely, consist of male competitors. Every year during the last week of March, however, 330 adventurous women from nearly every corner of the planet gather in Morocco for one full week of competition designed by women, for women. For the rally’s competitors, referred to as ‘Gazelles,’ points are deducted for requesting mechanical assistance or erging from the most direct route between checkpoints, meaning they are penalized for sidestepping any of the obstacles the desert throws their way. Those who have never been to the Sahara might imagine a relatively consistent landscape – endless miles of flat, sandy terrain – but in the desert’s northwestern edge the scenery can change dramatically from one mile to the next. From behind the wheel of an off-road vehicle drivers will witness the ersity of the terrain in rapid succession, the rocky ground below their tires switching from slippery sand to bumpy pebbles to jagged rocks to towering mountains and back again with little indication of what challenge lies around the next bend. One moment they’re driving through herds of wild camel grazing in the flat grasslands, the next they’re climbing wave after wave of tsunami-sized sand dunes that give little traction even to tires built specially for desert driving. “I wanted to make an intelligent rally, rather than an adrenaline rally something that went beyond just putting your foot on the accelerator and advancing along in a straight line,” said the event’s founder, Dominique Serra, speaking through a French translator in her mobile office one evening midway through the competition. “I had to come up with a concept that would prevent people from driving fast.” Serra first conceived of the rally, now in its 28th year, as a member of France’s largest employer association, MEDEF. “Women were not being represented in the automotive industry, and I was asked to find a way to empower these women,” she explained. The first Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles was held in 1990, and consisted of nine French teams of two. In its 2018 iteration the rally welcomed 165 teams from 16 countries in four different vehicle classes, with a majority competing in the 4x4truck category. In addition, nine teams competed this year in dune buggies, five teams raced each other in crossovers and five more drove fully electric cars through a modified course that allowed for sufficient charging time between legs. Even with a modified course those driving electric vehicles had to overcome the significant challenges associated with traversing off road terrain in vehicles designed primarily for urban driving, but Serra says their incorporation last year was a natural next step for what she labels a “responsible rally.” In 2010, the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles became the first automotive competition to obtain the international environmental certification in accordance with the ISO 14001 (2004) standard, and those painstaking efforts are plainly visible at the ‘bivouac’ or base camp where competitors mingle, eat and set up camp each night. All garbage produced there is either recycled or incinerated, with food waste donated to local farmers as animal feed and plastic water bottles converted into building material in local villages. “They take the empty water bottles and fill them with sand to use as building blocks,” said Serra. “All of the C02 emissions are offset. Even the mechanic’s area, which is a potential source of pollution, every measure is taken so that not a drop of oil hits the ground.”The medical teams that support the rally also provide free consultations and assistance to villagers in this remote region of Morocco, many of who have no other access to health services of any kind. The organization is also involved in local initiatives that help build schools, daycare services, provide job training to women, donate wheelchairs and glasses and much more. As a direct result of these efforts the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles is the only event of its kind to bear the Moroccan royal coat of arms, which can be found on the left shoulder of each competitor’s uniform vest. “There are a huge number of motor sports that go on in Morocco – this is the world’s playground for off road races – but this is the only one that has that level of respect from the host country,” said Serra, who was awarded the Order of Ouissam Alaouite, the country’s equivalent to America’s Legion of Merit or France’s Legion of Honour, by Morocco’s King Mohammed VI in 2013. “He follows the rally every year, and he appreciates the efforts we’ve made for Morocco.”While the event officially kicked off with an inspection and opening ceremony celebration in Nice, France, on 16 March, competitors have been preparing themselves and their cars for months. “The first part of the job, which is the biggest one, is to find sponsors,” French racer Julie Kohlman said. “You meet people, you talk to them about the event, you try to get money to register for the event, so that’s the first part.” While the event is primarily comprised of amateur drivers Kohlmann explains that they need to think and act like professionals in order to raise the nearly €15,000 (approximately $18,000) entry fee on top of the significant investments that needs to be put into their vehicles.“You need to have a good car, you need to prepare the car, and you need to know exactly what you want to do with the car,” she said, adding that each team is really comprised of three competitors, “the third being the car”.While the competitors are left to old-school navigation techniques behind the scenes a complex machine is plotting and tracking their every move. “From here we can know the position of each Gazelle team on the terrain, and we receive their position on a radar screen, like the ones used in aviation traffic control,” said Serge Barbieux, the rally’s assistant sport director, sitting behind a radar screen inside a trailer at basecamp. “A system installed in each of the cars, called Aerotrack, sends us the position of the car every five minutes.”While the onboard GPS system doesn’t reveal any information to the Gazelles about their position, it can be used to call for mechanical or medical assistance if needed. Barbieux explains that there’s only one situation when the system is used to communicate with drivers unprompted. “If we see a car getting close to the Algerian border we phone them through the Aerotrack satellite box and we tell them just to check their navigation again,” he said. An air traffic controller in Lyon, France, the rest of the year, Barbieux sees a lot of similarities between his day job and his work at the rally. “It’s very similar to watch vehicles moving on a radar screen, taking care of them like I do with aircrafts, just without being able to help them,” he said. Barbieux also assists in testing the course before the competitors arrive, and helps conduct the day and a half long navigation training program that each Gazelle must complete in order to participate. “I train them before they come, but when I’m here I’m just on mute,” he said. When designing the course Barbieux explains that organizers need to set up multiple checkpoints and plot multiple paths for each of the six legs of the competition, which includes two marathon legs that  two days each. The variation in routes ensures that competitors are not unable to follow tracks or other cars to the next checkpoint, nor can they practice their designated route in advance. In fact, competitors are only provided the coordinates of their checkpoints at the daily 5am roll call. While speed and timing is not a factor in the scoring checkpoints close at 7pm each day, providing some level of urgency to an otherwise unhurried competition. “It’s hard slowing down, because we’re used to speeding up,” said Keanna Erickson-Chang, a 23-year-old American professional rally competitor who is more accustomed to racing the clock. Though speed is less of a factor Erickson-Chang says it does provide an advantage. “We still want to keep our time up because as the sun gets higher the sand gets looser,” she explained, while releasing air from her tires to help increase traction in preparation for the slippery patch of sand dunes that sit between her and the next checkpoint. Since its inception Serra says there has been interest from men wanting to compete in a compass-and-map style rally, and this past November they finally got that opportunity when first annual Gazelles and Men rally welcomed mixed-gender and all male teams for the first time.“It’s exactly like the Gazelles, and you have a lot of former Gazelles that want to compete with their husbands,” said former competitor and current Gazelle and Men project manager, Maud Garnier. “It’s very funny because we were thinking wow, woman and husband in the same car, it will be very difficult, maybe we should have a ‘orce’ button on the dashboard.” All jokes aside Garnier says the event was a success, and she’s proud to report that no orce filings directly resulted. “It’s the first time a women’s rally has served as an example to a men’s event usually it’s the other way around,” adds Serra. While there is a designated E-Gazelles category with five competitors the rally actually included six electric vehicles this year. Car number 313 competed in the crossover section, and the vehicle – a modified Renault Zoe, Europe’s most popular electric vehicle – was piloted by two of the car manufacturer’s engineers. Team 313 ultimately placed second amongst the five crossover competitors. The team was followed throughout the competition by a support truck carrying emergency batteries, but the team would have been penalized for charging the vehicle more than once per day. As a result Poisson says she and her teammate had to consider not only the most direct path between checkpoints, but also the most battery conserving. “We’re not thinking in kilometers, we’re thinking in kilowatts,” she said. Serra hopes to see the event become entirely electric one day, adding another point to the laundry list of reasons why the Rallye Aïcha des Gazelles is unlike anything else in the sport.

But a whisper from a friend in the crowd broke the news to him that he had been disqualified for obstructing Trinidad and Tobago’s Jereem Richards, who finished second, in the dying moments of the race.It was a chaotic addendum to an evening during which Team England clawed back some respectability in the athletics stadium with five medals, an impressive bronze for Dina Asher-Smith in the 200m among them.Hughes appeared to run out of steam towards the end of an absorbing race and extended a forearm across Richards’s lane. Upon being told of the disqualification the Englishman, who led throughout the race after an electrifying start, looked shocked but continued to pose for photographs.England lodged an appeal against the disqualification but a panel of judges from the Bahamas, Singapore and Norfolk Island upheld the decision more than 90 minutes after he crossed the line. Richards was upgraded to gold, Aaron Brown of Canada was promoted to silver and Northern Ireland’s Leon Reid sobbed after being told he would receive a bronze medal.Richards said he believed he would have overcome Hughes had he not been impeded. “He was ahead and when I started to catch him he started to break down and I felt his hand come across and hit me,” the Trinidadian sprinter added. “That’s probably why they disqualified him. If he didn’t hit me I would have gone past him. That hit threw me off my rhythm.”It would have been a first major title for Hughes, who impressed through the rounds and in a warm-up race in Australia.In January he had been left shaken when shot at in an attempted robbery at his training base in Jamaica, where he was loading his equipment into a car after a session at the Racers Track Club and a place he used to train alongside Usain Bolt. “This guy just came up pointing a gun in my face,” Hughes said at the time. “He asked me for my phone and I ran off and the guy opened fire.”Asher-Smith, Hughes’ former girlfriend, said she felt emotional for him after the disqualification. “I know how much this meant to him but he is in great shape and that is what you have to take away from it. He has a whole year to get a first, which I know he will.”Earlier she took bronze in the 200m, one of the most hotly contested races of the athletics programme at the Carrara Stadium, finishing ahead of the double Olympic champion Elaine Thompson of Jamaica. Asher-Smith, 22, was leading coming off the bend but was caught by the world champion Shaunae Miller-Uibio, who took gold in a Games record of 22.09sec with Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson winning silver in 22.18.Before Thursday evening’s session Team England had won only two athletics medals in four days but they claimed five in two hours, kickstarted by Sophie Hahn taking gold in the T38 100m in 12.46sec. Shara Proctor won bronze in the long jump with a fourth-round leap of 6.75m, and Luke Cutts cleared 5.45m to clinch bronze in the pole vault. Kyle Langford concluded the evening with a storming finish to take silver in the 800m.The 22-year-old came home strongly, by far the fastest-finishing man in the field. He covered the final 100m in 13.26sec but could not quite catch Wycliffe Kinyamal of Kenya.“With 200m to go I felt absolutely awesome,” Langford said. “I got stuck in a bit of traffic but they started to die, a lot of them. When I got round the bend I just had so much left, I know I should’ve been winning it. Every training session and run I do I envisage myself winning gold so to come up short is gutting but as an athlete you either win or you learn. By the Tokyo Olympics it’s definitely going to be gold, I can assure you.”Katarina Johnson-Thompson led the heptathlon with 3,765 points after the first day of competition, 120 clear of her closest rival. It was a mediocre opening day for the 25-year-old who concluded the first four disciplines with a best effort of only 11.45m in the shot put. She admitted to feeling mentally drained after winning pentathlon gold at the world indoor championships in Birmingham last month.“I’m happy I’m in the lead, a bit confused with some of my results but it’s what I should expect in April,” the Liverpudlian said. “After Birmingham I was more mentally tired than physically tired so instead of pushing on I had to let my body rest and take it easy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af5ff7e7a49bcc6fbb46cd3b3414a708873bd3fd/430_56_2151_1291/master/2151.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8029a26881ceadcb52e9f9432e2bafb0 1240w","title":"jono ross sale premiership newcastle","story":"Not since Sale won their only Premiership title a dozen years ago have English rugby’s northern lights shone so brightly. With three rounds left both the Sharks and Newcastle Falcons are strong contenders for Europe’s Champions Cup qualification with a top-four spot hinging on the outcome of Friday ’s shoot-out at Kingston Park.The two clubs are separated by only one point in fifth and sixth positions, with the winners set to jump into third. Wasps and Leicester will not be easily denied play-off places but fifth-placed Newcastle, with two of their last three games at home plus an away trip to face the Tigers, can still shape their own destiny.The Sharks will have to dig even deeper, with a long hike to Exeter and a final home fixture against Leicester rounding off a tricky run-in, but their confidence has been given a timely lift by last week’s dramatic last-gasp win over Wasps. Trailing 17-0 in the first half they came back to win 28-27 courtesy of Marland Yarde’s last-second try.According to their captain, Jono Ross, the trick now is to reproduce their dominant home form on the road. This season they have won away against only the bottom three teams in the league and will need to find an extra gear to outwit the Falcons and the Chiefs. “We think we’re a good side but we haven’t been as good as we’ve wanted to away from home,” Ross said. “We need to replicate the performances we’ve put in at the AJ Bell. Hopefully that will be enough.”A big finish would also improve Ross’s chances of a place on England’s tour to his native South Africa. The Johannesburg-born back-row forward is qualified for England via a grandmother from Essex and Sale’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond, said Eddie Jones and England’s forwards coach, Steve Borthwick, have been making inquiries.Ross, who had stints as a young player with Harlequins, Saracens and the Bulls in South Africa, spent three years playing alongside Sergio Parisse for Stade Français before joining Sale last summer and has become an influential figure for the Sharks, assuming the captaincy after an injury to Will Addison. “For me it’s about performing well for Sale week-in week-out. I don’t want to think about things that are out of my control. I’ve had no conversations with Eddie at all but every player out there has international aspirations.”The 27-year-old is clearly resilient, having featured in every league game this season, and has been pleasantly surprised by life in the Premiership compared with the slower-paced Top 14. “The speed of the game and the conditioning are quite different to what I experienced over in France. It’s more similar to back home in South Africa. There are also a fantastic group of people here. We care about each other and I think that shows.”For the Newcastle game Paolo Odogwu and Luke James start at left wing and inside-centre respectively, with the tighthead prop WillGriff John returning to the front row and Byron McGuigan named at full-back. The 18-year-old Cameron Redpath, the English-qualified son of the former Scotland international Bryan, is poised to make his Premiership debut off the bench.Newcastle’s lineup features Gary Graham, finally back after injuring his neck at England training in early February, with Joel Hodgson, the league’s most accurate goalkicker this season, chosen ahead of Toby Flood at fly-half. “For us it’s a must-win game in terms of keeping our top-four hopes alive,” said Dean Richards, the Falcons’ director of rugby. “If we don’t win we can almost kiss the semi-finals goodbye.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7405c5fc9466c0be80616b4a13277117ee5fede2/0_86_4445_2668/master/4445.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8283cbb09cfd5158ef310e199f5b3c94 2600w","title":"grand national 2018 a horse by horse betting guide","story":"We go through the 40 runners for the 2018 edition of the world’s most famous horse raceLong had a big reputation but one win from 13 runs over fences is disappointing. Worth remembering, in light of Native River’s Gold Cup win, that Minella Rocco beat that one at the previous two Festivals, including when he won the four-miler as a six-year-old. A big, strong stayer, he can have a lumbering look over his fences and might not be best suited by having to navigate the Canal Turn among rivals. Like many others from his stable, he has not been at his best this winter. Carries more weight than any National winner since 1974. Looked the likely winner when going clear after the third-last a year ago but was on fumes by the final fence and faded into fourth. More conservative tactics might help but he’s 9lb higher and carries 12lb more in absolute terms. Romped to glory in the Becher, showing how well he goes round here, but the extra weight he got for that did not help at Haydock in February, where he couldn’t go with the easy winner and finished tired. Travelled well and was still going on at the finish when third in the Gold Cup, suggesting he might cope with this distance. Beat 27 rivals by daylight in a hotly contested handicap chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. Still on a beatable rating but this is asking a lot, with a big weight to carry. Doesn’t always get that high at his fences and took a heavy fall in the Irish Gold Cup. Also took a liberty at Cheltenham’s third-last and there is likely to be at least one scare along the way.Couldn’t finish quite as strongly as a classy rival when second in the 2016 National. Shot up the ratings, has not won since and is still 10lb higher than that day. Faded into a well-beaten 16th last year and something similar seems likely. Admirably consistent but in need of luck.Wasn’t far off the best when with Willie Mullins, for whom he won two Grade Ones as a novice. May well have won the 2016 Irish Gold Cup, but for unseating at the last. Missed a year and four runs since his comeback seem to show him in decline. Still high in the weights, just 5lb below his peak, and would need something like his best to get involved here. Stamina must also be taken on trust, as he’s never raced beyond three miles and a furlong.Instantly improved by last summer’s move to Willie Mullins, since when his only failure has been a fall in the Gold Cup. Won the Munster National easily and then scrambled home in the Ladbrokes Trophy, when held up for a late challenge. Now 9lb higher but likely to have more to offer and wasn’t out of it when hitting the deck at Cheltenham. A clear round will surely put him in contention.Not far short of the best as a staying hurdler and useful over fences but is rated to the hilt of his ability. Ran a fair race to be eighth in last year’s Irish National, when he was hampered by a faller, and beaten only by Total Recall in the Munster National, trying to give him lumps of weight. Not usually a strong finisher and has broken blood vessels at times.Cheltenham specialist who has run many fine races there but not usually to the same level elsewhere. Pulled up at the fourth-last a year ago and only 2lb lower in the weights this time but trainer says he had an interrupted preparation then. A sound jumper and solid stayer with no secrets from the handicapper and likely to be outpaced by something if still in contention after the last.Would have an extra 4lb to carry if the weights had not been set in February, since when he ran a fine second at the Cheltenham Festival, finishing strongly to be beaten by a neck. Promising teenage jockey who rode that day will be aboard again. Pulled up four fences from home last year but was only seven and entitled to do better now. Hasn’t won since but several efforts have suggested he is ready for this marathon trip. Slight concern that his Cheltenham form is so much better than elsewhere.A front-runner when things go well, he never got involved last year and finished 17th. In common with most of his stablemates, has been well below his best this year but the yard is now getting winners. Wins over fences have come in small fields, which does not augur well here. It’s more than five years since he won at a track where the bends go to the left.Irish Gold Cup winner of 2015 and 2016, this veteran has dropped a stone from his peak rating in the past year and is now on a weight that would make him dangerous if he returned to something like his best. Has shown little in four runs this season but all came before New Year, when he has not traditionally been at his best. Interesting.Winner of the last two Scottish Grand Nationals, proving that big-field marathon handicaps on flat, left-handed tracks in the spring are his thing. That makes him of obvious interest, though he’s no certainty to get round. He fell at the first a year ago, one of three times in his last nine starts he’s managed to get rid of his jockey. A big run is possible if he avoids such disasters.Three times a winner at the Cheltenham Festival, including in the Cross-Country last month. Has also won a Munster National, so neither big fields nor marathon distances are a problem. He’s not wonderfully consistent and was well beaten on the two previous occasions when he ran a month after Festival success. Also, he’s not the biggest and could meet trouble when the field bunches up at the Becher’s – Canal Turn section of the course. But he undoubtedly has the talent to win and it would be no surprise if he did so with authority.Ran on in eye-catching style to be eighth last year, having seemingly been given too much to do. Put up another fine effort when third in the Ladbrokes Trophy in December and warmed up for this by scoring at Ascot in February. Has taken years to build on his early promise but finally doing so and has it in him to land a major prize. Still on a fair weight and 4lb well in, as his Ascot win came after the weights were set.Hoping it can be third time lucky but the limitations of his stamina seemed to be exposed by the last two Nationals. Has had a poor season, failing to finish within 12 lengths of a winner, but is slightly higher in the ratings than for his previous two attempts, which hardly seems fair. Comes from a stable having a poor run.Muddy marathons are the thing for this winner of last year’s Midlands National. On drier ground or against classy opposition, he generally gets left behind. Having won at Haydock in November, he went up 10lb and has struggled in two subsequent runs, suggesting he lacks the necessary quality unless it rains plenty. A dogged galloper, he goes well at Newbury and should therefore be suited by this circuit. Looked as though he was reaching the limits of his stamina when headed close home in the Great Yorkshire Chase, over a mile shorter than this. Up against it, on a rating 12lb higher than when he last won.Third in the Scottish National two years ago, though his jumping was scrappy at times and his stamina gave out about a furlong from the line. Has had a wind operation. Because of injuries, his decent third in a much shorter race last month was his first run over fences for 16 months, which is not ideal preparation. Nicely weighted on the pick of his form, including a defeat of Blaklion at Cheltenham two years ago. Jumped the last with the leaders last year but had nothing left and tired into fifth, having taken a shoulder-barge from the runner-up at the second-last. Fell at the first in 2015 but usually does well over these fences, having won here in December. Has held his form so well that he is now rated higher than ever, 4lb higher than for last year’s race. Another respectable showing is likely.Career best in January when running away with the Peter Marsh, pulling 13 lengths clear of Captain Redbeard. Was fired up the ratings to a mark 9lb higher than he’s ever been and may struggle to compete until he drops back down. He was carrying less weight that day than four other finishers of moderate talent, whereas here he will mix with Festival winners on a similar weight. Stopped quickly and was found to have bled from the nose when pulled up at Haydock in February.Given every chance last year by a masterful Ruby Walsh ride, creeping smoothly into contention on the second circuit before getting tired from the third-last and finishing ninth. Jumped soundly but stumbled and nearly unseated on landing over second Valentine’s, which can’t have helped. Only 1lb lower, despite modest efforts on both starts this season, and won’t have Walsh’s help. This plodder must be one of the few horses to spend three years in Gordon Elliott’s yard without winning. Often runs well, however, and has twice been placed in the Thyestes and also in Leopardstown’s Paddy Power Chase. Was a distant sixth in this race two years ago after notable mistakes. Went well last year until a rival jumped across him at Becher’s, causing his rider to fall off. Generally a sound jumper but will surely find something too quick for him on the run-in, even if his stamina holds up.Fine record at Aintree in April stretches back to 2011, when he won a Grade One novice hurdle. Won a handicap chase the next year and has since been second and third in the National, from four attempts. Soft ground is no use, as he showed when pulled up in 2016. Gets to run off the same rating as when third last year but we can’t be sure he retains his ability aged 12. He’s had just two runs this season and predictably failed to cope with soggy ground both times. Stable has been quiet for a month or two.Record of steady progress over the years and showed his best form with three consecutive wins last spring and summer, battling to win the City of Perth Gold Cup on the line. Only 4lb higher for that, though this represents an enormous step up in quality. Best form has been on a dry surface and he won’t get that. Likely to show up well for a long way before fading.Stormed clear in the Welsh Grand National and would have done the same the previous season if he hadn’t bumped into a future Gold Cup winner in Native River. Is also a winner of the Munster National and two Cork Nationals, giving him an excellent record in big-field marathons. Gone up another 6lb to match the highest rating he’s ever had and Chepstow form does not always translate well to Aintree. He’s a hold-up horse who will therefore need luck, which he didn’t get last year, when he unseated his jockey while dodging a faller. Would be the oldest winner for 95 years but clearly is not in decline. Very dangerous if able to get into contention by the third-last.Entered the reckoning with an authoritative success in the North Yorkshire Grand National, when he made all the running. Went up a stone in the weights, which is a lot for beating five finishers who have done little for the form. That might have been his big day, in a race the trainer was winning for the third year in a row, at a course where this horse is unbeaten. But he copes well with a stamina test and could have more to offer.Has a good record round Aintree’s Mildmay course, which may not translate to the much bigger National course and fences. Disappointing when eighth there in November and had a wind operation the next month. Unraced since mid-December, an unorthodox National preparation. Likes a dry-ish surface, so could do without much rain. Fairly weighted and could get involved if everything falls right but more likely to be seeking softer targets.Tough, staying mare who is still young enough to have her best days ahead of her, being younger than any National winner since 1940. Never got into it when sixth in the 2016 Irish National and could only find the one pace when fifth in the Welsh National that year. Last seen running a fair third in Punchestown’s National Trial, giving weight to the first two, who made that form look good in the Irish National. She’s in big trouble if a turn of foot is required but, granted soft ground, she could get a lot of these in trouble by grinding along relentlessly in front.Went into a lot of notebooks as a National type when bolting up by 12 lengths in a race on the Mildmay course here two years ago, but then had to miss last year’s National after a badly timed injury. Hard to say how much ability he retains, as he’s been raced so sparingly and often over hurdles but it’s a concern that he is now older than any National winner since 1923. Leap of faith required.Stamina is the most obvious weak spot for this talented but frustrating type who appears not to be the most robust. Beaten over 100 lengths into 13th two years ago, eased down on the run-in on soft ground. Has only had two runs since, when a fine second in last year’s Kim Muir and when well beaten in the same race this year. Ground made the difference it was good when he was second, very testing when he flopped. Hard to believe he’s a National winner in waiting. Famously frustrating beast who has finished fast but too late on many a day, often after killing his chance with a mistake. Has been held back by metal pins in a back leg but the trainer says he’s moving better than ever and won a decent pot at Sandown in January. Offsetting that he ran so poorly when 12th in the 2016 National on soft ground, which should have suited, and after a much stronger season than this one.One of the least experienced in the field after just four runs over fences, of which his only win came in a 2016 beginners’ chase. Background and pedigree suggest his stamina might not stretch to a race like this and he was pulled up on his only attempt in a long-distance handicap chase. Doesn’t seem to like big fields. Rating looks a bit high. Hard to fancy.Ruined his chance last year by boiling over before the start. Did pretty well, then, to work his way into contention by the second-last but was a tired seventh in the end. Fell on his only outing since, when heavy ground did not suit. If the weather dries up and he behaves himself, it’s not beyond him to get involved off a rating that has dropped a stone and a half from his peak. He was a dual Festival winner but four years is a long time to make your supporters wait for another victory.Game and consistent, he’s already had an excellent season, winning the Tommy Whittle in December and chasing home The Dutchman in the Peter Marsh back at Haydock. Warmed up with a first hurdles success for two years. Still on a beatable rating in the right contest but this might not be it. There’s a lot more strength in depth than he’s used to meeting and all his wins have come in single-figure fields. Not the most efficient jumper, mixing flamboyant leaps with the odd mistake. He didn’t have much left at the end of his last two races.Thoroughly experienced plodder after 38 starts over fences. By no means a prolific winner in recent seasons, though he managed to nick a weak race at Sandown in November. Got round in his own time to be 10th last year, beaten by 42 lengths. Could do better if the ground is soft. Blinkers may have helped when he was third at Ascot last month and could do so again. A distant third in the Welsh National last season and has since dropped 9lb, while his stable has finally hit form after a bleak winter, so a case can be made for him plugging on into fifth, maybe.Veteran of 46 races over fences showed his wellbeing by winning round Cheltenham’s cross-country course in December. Has twice been second in the Irish National and was beaten just a short-head in 2016 under Ruby Walsh. Now 6lb higher than when second at Fairyhouse last year. Jumping has never been flawless but a clear round could easily put him in the leading bunch on the run from the third-last. Doubtful he can be fastest from there. Could do with the ground drying up.Gave a mulish display when dropping himself out in the Welsh National and was then remarkably revived by the fitting of blinkers when an easy winner of Warwick’s Classic Chase. A change of jockey may also have helped. Believing he would miss the cut for this, connections raced him in two more marathons on heavy going in the past two months, including a fair second in the Midlands National. Will have to be remarkably robust to show his best form here at the end of such a taxing season.Close second in the Badger Ales on his first run of the season but went up a few pounds and has not really shone in stronger races since. Travelled strongly in the Welsh National and Kim Muir before the limitations of his stamina appeared to be shown up in both. Was running a fair race just behind the leaders when his saddle slipped at the second Canal Turn two years ago, causing him to be pulled up. Now 7lb lower and capable of going well again, though his form this season has been patchy. Was giving lumps of weight to the first three when fourth at Chepstow in October and plugged on gamely to be fourth in the Kim Muir last month. Stamina must be in question, given he got tired and faded in the Hennessy for the last two years.Career peaked with an extremely game effort to be third in an attritional Cheltenham Gold Cup three years ago, when quality rivals like Many Clouds, Silviniaco Conti and Carlingford Lough were a long way behind.

Ishiguro will collaborate on the adaptation, by playwright and novelist Barney Norris. It will tour the UK after its world premiere at Northampton’s Royal \u0026amp Derngate in February next year.Ishiguro won the Booker prize in 1989 for his poignant novel about a journey undertaken by an English butler, Stevens, who looks back over his life in service at Darlington Hall. It became a film in 1993, produced by Merchant Ivory, and earned eight Oscar nominations. Anthony Hopkins starred as the butler and Emma Thompson played Miss Kenton, Darlington Hall’s former housekeeper, with whom Stevens is reunited. The novel was inspired by PG Wodehouse’s Jeeves and, more surprisingly, as Ishiguro explained in an article for the Guardian, by Francis Ford Coppola’s The Conversation and the Tom Waits song Ruby’s Arms. The stage version will be directed by Christopher Haydon, who said “Norris has exactly the right theatrical understanding and delicate sensibility to turn this engaging and highly political love story into a moving and dynamic piece of theatre.” Norris said The Remains of the Day is: “One of those stories that appear every now and again which seem, almost as soon as they’re written, to belong to the world. It has entered the bloodstream of our culture. To work with such extraordinary material is a great gift.”The Remains of the Day is produced by Royal \u0026amp Derngate and the touring company Out of Joint, in association with Oxford Playhouse. It opens in Northampton on 23 February 2019. Later this year, the Royal \u0026amp Derngate will stage the world premiere of another bestseller, Alice Sebold’s The Lovely Bones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4acf0c753aed580870497707c150b015b08d0c0f/0_0_3905_2343/master/3905.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=13a19d22c9d7d62729c0c6de5010ccdf 1240w","title":"instagram users download own data portability tool","story":"New portability tool will allow users to extract copy of own content posted on social networkInstagram has confirmed it will let users download their personal data, including previously shared photos, videos and messages, as it prepares for the European data regulation GDPR.While its parent company, Facebook, had announced a suite of GDPR controls, which Mark Zuckerberg emphasised during his testimony to Congress this week, Instagram had been quiet on the issue.GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) brings with it a number of rights for iniduals, including to demand deletion of data, to opt out of future data collection, and to view the personal data a company possesses and to download it in a format that can be moved over to competitors.These were the requirements Instagram would fulfil shortly, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. “We are building a new data portability tool,” a spokesperson said. “You’ll soon be able to download a copy of what you’ve shared on Instagram, including your photos, videos and messages.”The tool will be helpful for users who want to extract what they have uploaded to Instagram. Treasured photos and videos can sometimes get lost in their original form, but currently there are few ways to easily access the high-resolution originals if they have been posted on the social network. It is unclear whether the company will also include details of a user’s advertising profiling in its data download. The wealth of information included in Facebook’s equivalent service shocked some users, who were unhappy to discover that the company had tracked metadata of their text and phone conversations.GDPR comes into effect on 25 May, which means the coming month will probably include a flurry of announcements similar to Instagram’s. Many large tech companies, including Google, have yet to confirm whether they are altering their products to comply with the regulation.According to EUObserver, the European commission intends to police that deadline according to the date of disclosure, not the date of the underlying breach. This means any company that has been withholding knowledge of a successful hack will need to disclose that fact sooner rather than later, or risk a hefty penalty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02c5fc2b42591243e6292fc83f8a97ed78807b57/206_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e0aab9f557ca706d7b7ecce5770d94e1 1240w","title":"racism slurs reddit post ceo steve huffman","story":"Steve Huffman says communities can set own guidelines, but racism is permitted on wider site as people have ‘different beliefs’Racist slurs are permitted on Reddit, says the popular social news and discussion site’s chief executive, Steve Huffman.Within a discussion thread that followed the publishing of the site’s transparency report on Russian propaganda, Huffman, in reply to a question from a Reddit user about whether “open racism, including slurs” are allowed on the platform, said their use was not against Reddit’s rules.“On Reddit, the way in which we think about speech is to separate behavior from beliefs,” said Huffman under his username spez. “This means on Reddit there will be people with beliefs different from your own, sometimes extremely so. When users’ actions conflict with our content policies, we take action.”Hoffman’s controversial response explains why outwardly racist and high-profile communities have been allowed to operate on a site that has 542 million monthly visitors.“Our approach to governance is that communities can set appropriate standards around language for themselves. Many communities have rules around speech that are more restrictive than our own, and we fully support those rules,” Hoffman said.Reddit’s approach to offensive behaviour has evolved from a position of actively banning users for hate speech to one allowing it under the guise of free speech.In July 2015 Hoffman said of banning hate speech: “I don’t think we should silence people just because their viewpoints are something we disagree with. There is value in the conversation, and we as a society need to confront these issues. This is an incredibly complex topic, and I’m sure our thinking will continue to evolve.”That evolution appears to have created a light-touch moderation policy that permits racism and hate speech unless otherwise banned by the particular subreddit’s rules. Reddit will still take action when there is evidence of direct threats or incitement of violence. But some high-profile subeddits, including The_Donald, have been accused of participating in the organisation of events such as the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that led to the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, with seemingly little consequence."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

The youngsters are still expected at the gate on Sunday evening or at the latest Monday morning and are not allowed to go outside before Friday,” he said.“We are also looking into extending the free weekend by focusing more on the lessons. The army is even studying whether the boarding regime can be relaxed or even lifted. Then the recruits who live near the military school or the barracks can go home in the evening.”The defence ministry has been on a major recruitment drive, but it has been a hard sell because of pension reforms, poor job prospects on leaving the army and a demand in recent years for soldiers to patrol the streets of Belgium’s major cities under the counter-terrorism operation Vigilant Guardian.Danny Lams, a former paratrooper who chairs a veterans’ organisation representing Ostend and the areas bordering the Netherlands, nevertheless condemned the army’s plans to allow soldiers to sleep at home.“That’s how you grow a defence of nothing, an army that you cannot count on. You do not go to a war zone with men who miss their mama,” he said.“We used to sleep on the cold ground under a leaky tarpaulin. We wanted to serve our country. If you allow the recruits to go home during the week, the military will soon ask for a mobile home if they are sent to the front.”Some units patrolled the streets for about 200 days out of 365 last year. Belgium has 70 personnel in Afghanistan protecting Mazar-i-Sharif airport in the north of the country. The army has 2,204 women in its ranks and 25,687 men."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b556705c7c437ac38bb27aae4602f07e1d878c9d/0_380_3660_2196/master/3660.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39aac43e9ab915662276eceb3f72135a 1240w","title":"damascenes syria conflict us","story":"Residents debate likelihood of US airstrikes as troops and fighter jets resume operationsFighter jets have returned to the skies of northern Syria and ground troops in Damascus are on the move again.A nervous night watching the horizon gave way to a business-as-usual feel on Thursday in the Syrian capital. Whether Donald Trump will carry out his threats to bomb Syria, or give way to a realpolitik that sees some other sort of compromise thrashed out is a prime debating point before sunset when, according to residents, a countdown to a US barrage could begin.Even if Trump unleashes the formidable US arsenal on targets across the country in retaliation for the suspected chemical attack on the Syrian town of Douma, there is a feeling in Damascus that the regime will prevail. Russian news agencies on Thursday reported that Syrian government forces had raised their flag over the central mosque in Douma, at the heart of the formerly rebel-held eastern Ghouta region on the edge of Damascus.The Syrian capital is a strikingly different place to the city it was when Barack Obama was making his own decisions about whether to bomb. Then, Damascus was wobbling under the weight of insurgency. Its allies had not arrived in the numbers in which they are now deployed. The defence of the country looked threadbare.“Iran is here, so is Hezbollah, and the Russians have their air defence missiles,” said Haithem Chams, a resident of the outer Damascus suburbs, who spoke by phone. “The Russians might shoot the American missiles down. Then who’s the strongest?”Two residents who spoke to the Guardian said military convoys had moved through western Damascus past the Sayeda Zainab shrine and towards the Lebanese border on Thursday morning. Reports elsewhere said Hezbollah, which has been at the arrowhead of the Assad regime’s ground defence, had regrouped west of the capital, away from air force targets that are expected to bear the brunt of any US strike.Much of what remains of the Syrian air force has been moved to Russian bases in the country. Iraqi and Iranian media speculated that some Syrian jets had been flown to Iran to avoid any attacks, but this could not be independently confirmed. The working assumption in Syria is that Trump’s generals would advise him to target Syrian air bases, from where suspected chemical attacks have been launched.Any strike this time would probably be more comprehensive than the attack that hit the Shayrat airbase near Homs in April 2017, three days after the sarin strike on the northern town of Khan Sheikhun.In theory there are three alternative responses - the first a punitive strike such as the US attack on the Shayrat air base in April 2017 that saw 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles hit the the air base in response to a chemical weapons attack.The second level of attack is to seek to prevent Syria attempting to use chemical weapons again by destroying the relevant facilities, the means of delivery and imposing a punishment.The third level of activity is to seek to weaken the entire Assad military infrastructure or even attack Assad\u0027s presidential palace, as well as Syrian military headquarters.\u0026nbspBut there is no appetite in Western capitals to forcibly dislodge Assad from office, even if there may be an unspoken wish to change the way the Syrian government negotiates at UN peace talks in Geneva.Helicopters that have dropped barrel bombs on Ghouta have mostly taken off from the Dumair airbase north of the city. The Russian air force maintains a presence there, as it does in many other Syrian military facilities. Its main presence, however, is in the north-west of the country, where its S-400 air defence system, which has never been tested in battle, is poised to be used against any US missiles.“The Americans wouldn’t dare fly planes against us,” said Mohammed al-Rai, a supporter of the Syrian government from Homs. “Look what happened to the Israeli plane. Worse will happen to them.“Things were difficult a few years ago, but they’re better now. If the Americans blow up some runways to aid the jihadists, so what? They won’t win.”What Trump has in mind after any strike is confounding Syrians on both sides of the conflict. “We hope he will take this awful president out,” said Maher Sergie, an opponent of Assad who was exiled from Aleppo to Idlib. “May an American missile chase him to his basement.”“He hasn’t got a clue what to do,” said a regime supporter who refused to be named. “He doesn’t even want to stay here. The regime knows this, so do the Russians and Iran. If he was smart he would try to back out of this.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3459769.1523547002!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"germany supports irish insistence on border backstop says minister","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney  with  German federal minister for foreign affairs Heiko Maas following talks at Iveagh House, Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Irish TimesIreland’s insistence that the Brexit treaty includes a backstop to preserve the island’s open border enjoys the full support of Germany, the German foreign minister has insisted.Heiko Maas, the new federal German foreign minister, made the pledge as he met Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney in Dublin.The discussions happened ahead of Mr Maas’s scheduled meeting with British foreign secretary Boris Johnston.Mr Maas said Germans understood the emotional sensitivities around the Border, given his country’s own experience of ision. “I do understand the need that we do whatever we can in order to avoid a flaring up of a historic conflict,” he said.“We have to do everything we can to avoid the glimmer of seeing something like a hard border become reality.”Mr Coveney said the solidarity shown by Germany was “very, very reassuring”.“We have got unambiguous solidarity today from the largest country in the European Union, and that is hugely appreciated on the Irish Border issue,” he said.“I think the Germans do understand actually the significance of borders and barriers and the emotions that get stirred up by that type of imagery.”He added: “The idea that anybody could be talking about the re-emergence of physical border infrastructure on the island of Ireland is something that we simply can’t allow to go unchallenged or unchecked.”Mr Coveney reiterated his view that the backstop agreement struck between the UK and the EU in December, which would see Northern Ireland align with much of the EU’s regulatory framework, was only a “fall-back” position and that the preferred option was for both parties to agree a wide-ranging post-Brexit trading agreement.But he warned: “There will be no withdrawal treaty if there is not a backstop on Irish Border in that treaty.”“We believe that to be a question with regard to which Great Britain has to take a decision.” – Press AssociationNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3458513.1523469092!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government looks to push closer german ties ahead of brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman foreign minister Heiko Maas (above left) will travel to Dublin on Thursday to meet Tánaiste Simon Coveney, while German  finance minister Olaf Scholz (above centre) and his Irish counterpart Paschal Donohoe will meet in Berlin. Photograph: Fabrizio BenschReutersMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney will today unveil proposals for closer Irish-German ties when Germany’s new foreign minister, Heiko Maas, visits Dublin.The plan is expected to involve a new consulate in Frankfurt, a joint Irish-German economic council, closer political and ministerial exchanges and a greater arts push co-ordinated by a new cultural director in Berlin.The Irish Embassy in Berlin has since December been consulting on proposals to boost Ireland’s profile in Germany ahead of Brexit and next year’s 90th anniversary of the first Irish diplomatic mission to the country. Germany is not just first among equals in the EU: it is Ireland’s second-largest source of inward investment, third-largest source of foreign guests, fourth-largest trading partner and fifth largest food export market.Bedded down in the Government’s wider plan to double Ireland’s global footprint by 2025, proposals raised during German consultations include an award recognising people who contribute to Irish-German relations and greater outreach to emigrant Irish families and second- and third-generation Irish.The Department of Foreign Affairs plan is an attempt to adapt to new post-Brexit realities but also to catch up with Irish people voting with their feet. In the six years to 2016, the Irish community in Germany grew by 40 per cent to 14,000 and continues to expand.The plan is likely to make clear that a reboot of Irish relations must engage closely with Angela Merkel’s federal government but also with the decentralised Germany beyond Berlin: 16 federal states, many with populations and economies dwarfing most EU members, which have huge autonomy in everything from investment to education policy.It is expected to propose regular German visits by Irish officials to co-ordinate bilateral and EU policy.Closer ties will hinge on Irish officials identifying and implementing useful projects with Germany – from cybersecurity co-operation to arms control and development co-operation in Africa.A key factor in realising the policy review is funding. An embassy survey flagged culture as the single most visible platform for Ireland in Germany. Yet, even as Ireland’s economy recovers, its annual cultural spend in Germany is a quarter that of Denmark and a fifth of Finland’s, two similarly sized countries.While those countries have dedicated cultural spaces, the report is likely to recommend rebranding the existing Embassy space as an “Ireland House” for cultural events.Frankfurt has emerged as the likely home of a new permanent consulate, given it is home to the European Central Bank, major European banks, the IDA and Tourism Ireland.The plan also underlines how selling Ireland, its products and services to Germany cannot happen unless those doing so speak German. With that in mind, the plan identifies a need for a new German language-learning push in Ireland and renewal of German-Irish education links.German officials have welcomed Ireland’s strategic review as timely. Mr Maas will use his first visit to Dublin – before heading on to London – to underline Berlin’s backing for Ireland’s Brexit position.Berlin officials see the Republic as a litmus test for Brexit: if it can be made work with minimum disruption on the island, it will work for the EU27.While Mr Maas is in Dublin, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will hold his first meeting in Berlin with his German counterpart Olaf Scholz. As well as discussing post-Brexit EU budget planning, Mr Donohoe will sound out the Social Democrat minister on whether to expect continuity or change from Berlin on the EU tax debate which, in Germany, has focused on Ireland.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/30/TELEMMGLPICT000159114527_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"british cheese now status symbol us japan","story":"British cheese makers are rapidly expanding to cope with the demand as traditional cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester are increasingly being recognized as a status symbol abroadBritish cheese exports are booming in a boost for the UK economy, thanks to a growing demand for smelly cheeseboards in US and Japan.British cheese makers are rapidly expanding to cope with the demand as traditional cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester are increasingly being recognized as a status symbol abroad, experts have said. Cheese producers now send around a third of their product abroad, with January 2018 seeing a 23 per cent increase in UK cheese exports compared with January of 2017, data from Dairy UK shows.English Blue Stilton cheese for sale at Broadway Market, HackneyFor example a £25m pound expansion is underway at a historic dairy in Leicestershire to meet a surge in demand for cheese from overseas.

Top brass are now considering dropping the long-standing rule that cadets must live in barracks during training.The situation has been exacerbated by pension reforms, poor job prospects after leaving and the long-running Operation Vigilant Guardian, which has seen soldiers patrolling major cities such as Brussels after the terror attacks in the capital in 2016 and Paris in 2015.

If you allow the recruits to go home during the week, the military will soon ask for a mobile home if they are sent to the front,” he told the Het Nieuwsblad newspaper.Alex Claesen, a spokesman for the ministry of defence, said: “The army wants to include more free evenings where the recruit can leave the barracks.“The youngsters are still expected at the gate on Sunday evening or at the latest Monday morning and are not allowed to go outside before Friday. We are also looking into extending the free weekend by focusing more on the lessons.”He added: “The army is even studying whether the boarding regime can be relaxed or even lifted. Then the recruits who live near the military school or the barracks can go home in the evening.”The 28,000 strong army has launched a recruitment drive, hoping to recruit 160 officers and 611 non-commissioned officers.Over the last ten years, 3,877 recruits dropped out with 16.2 per cent saying they quit because they missed family, friends and hobbies.Please review our commenting policyHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding on TV  Princess Anne is first Royal visitor to see Duke of Edinburgh in hospitalWhy is BA so keen to buy up its low-cost Norwegian rival?Two \u0026#39trendy\u0026#39 dinosaurs sold to same bidder for almost €3 million in ParisQueen marks 60 years of King George VI Day Centre in WindsorComment: Leave the shrine for Henry Vincent alone.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesQuaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The allegations centre around online strategies for the manipulation of voters deployed in the US 2016 Presidential election and the UK’s European Union referendum. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie has given evidence to parliament. Meanwhile, across the pond, Mark Zuckerberg will reportedly testify in front of the US Congress. The backlash has been brutal with the #DeleteFacebook movement taking off. Markets have responded accordingly with Facebook’s share value plummeting.Writing in The Observer last year, Carole Cadwalladr posited that Britain (and one may as well add the US) are increasingly looking like “a ‘managed’ democracy. Paid for by a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us.”However, the real story is much bigger than the fallout from the Trump election and the Brexit vote. It is a story that extends beyond a limited set of players in Silicon Valley and the billionaire super class. It encompasses governments, the military and intelligence agencies intent on exploiting the internet and social media for surveillance, control and manipulation of citizens and societies. Facebook removes hundreds of pages controlled by Russian organisationThe concept of managed democracy stretches back a hundred years. After the introduction of universal suffrage, the establishment was concerned about the outcome of elections. During the 1920s Edward Bernays was one of the pivotal figures who helped to develop the concept of managed democracy. Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud and the father of modern-day public relations. He understood that advertising could subliminally tap into the unconscious of repressed animal instincts, such as sexual desire. Bernays’ clients included some of the largest US corporations. Bernays transplanted the same techniques into politics as outlined in Adam Curtis’s 2002 BBC documentary The Century of the Self. This could be achieved through propaganda in various guises, such as the use of mass media in order to manipulate populations. The US military and CIA deployed psychological operations (mass propaganda induced through emotions) across the world in various theatres ranging from the wars in Korea and Vietnam to Central America during the Cold War. The only difference today is that the internet has become the new playground for 21st century psychological operations. How Silicon Valley and the super rich took controlHow Silicon Valley and the super rich took controlDonald Trump, Mike Pence and technology company chiefs at a meeting at Trump Tower in New York, 2016Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly agreed to testify before the US Congress following pressure from politiciansThe 2017 movie The Circle, based on the Dave Eggers novel and starring Emma Watson, tapped into the present mood of unease around technologyGoogle’s mapping technology is used for geospatial intelligence purposes, such as supporting US troops in IraqChristopher Wylie, one of the founders of Cambridge Analytica and now a whistleblower who exposed how the data firm harvested data from millions of Facebook usersAccording to The Observer, billionaire Robert Mercer applied a big data strategy to the political scene with a $10 million stake in the company Cambridge Analytica.According to Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda unit, prior to the US 2016 election, online automated bots were 5-1 in favour of Trump with many of them Russian. Whisteblower Edward Snowden\u0027s files confirmed that intelligence agencies monitor sites including YouTube and Facebook.Silicon Valley – from heroes to villainsFor a long time, Silicon Valley presented itself as the shiny, happy face of capitalism. It sold the promise of new technology that could connect the global village. Facebook’s mission statement was, “Making the world more open and connected”. The internet even held out the utopian possibility of liberating societies. Networks amplified political activism and bypassed the monopoly of the corporate media. The internet provided a cloak of anonymity for whistleblowers fighting state andor corporate power. Wikileaks and Julian Assange would even attempt to take credit for catalysing the Arab Spring through the Cablegate leaks revealing the corruption and vulgar excesses of tinpot dictators. Yet as with all technology, it has proved to be a double-edged sword. Disturbing revelations have exposed a darker side of exploitative, highly secretive and even sinister practices. Public sentiment has turned from infatuation to outrage. The 2017 movie The Circle, based on the Dave Eggers novel and starring Tom Hanks and Emma Watson, tapped into the present mood of unease.The marriage of big data and neoliberalism enabled the metrics of the market to be extended to every sphere in society. A Black Mirror episode “Nosee” imagined the dystopian vision in which this process is taken to its logical conclusion. Every emotional experience, lived moment and interaction is exploited, mined, recorded and measured with constant recalibration interfacing with one’s personal score and therefore social status. Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, is one of those credited with creating the profession of public relations (Getty)From here it is a short step to Foucault’s concept of the panopticon in which each person is scrutinising and scrutinised by everyone else. The mass collection and retention of data became linked in with surveillance – big brother meets big data. Simultaneously, big tech managed to carve out a libertarian philosophy while being integrated with the national security state. In fact, Silicon Valley has increasingly become part of the military-industrial complex selling its technologies to US military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Google, for example, has a contract with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) allowing the agency to use Google Earth Builder. Google’s mapping technology is used for geospatial intelligence purposes, such as supporting US troops in Iraq, while Google and the NGA purchased GeoEye-1, which is the world’s highest-resolution satellite. Lacie, the protagonist in the ‘Black Mirror’ episode ‘Nosee’, rating her social interactions on her phone (Getty)In fact, Google has a revolving door with the national security state employing managers with backgrounds in military and intelligence work and it partners with defence contractors including Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman focusing on drones and robotics. Similarly, Amazon has developed a $600m (£426m) cloud computing system for the CIA that also services all 17 US intelligence agencies. Data-mining tech company Palantir was co-founded by Trump donor and backer Peter Thiel. Palantir’s advisers include Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director George Tenet. Its customers include the NSA, FBI and CIA due to the fact that it is a leader in the field of mining massive data sets. It has been deployed by the Marines in Afghanistan and in the Mexican drug war. Its commercial clients include Bank of America, JPMorgan, News Corp and pharmaceutical firms. Peter Thiel is a Silicon Valley tech billionaire, who also co-founded PayPal as a system of electronic payment. He went on to give Mark Zuckerberg the first outside investment in Facebook consisting of a half-million-dollar loan later converted into a 7 per cent ownership stake and a seat on the board. Thiel’s hedge fund Clarium Capital Management had assets of more than $7bn before the financial crisis. His venture-capital firm Founders Fund has an online manifesto that begins, “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters” – summing up his pessimistic stance on the demise of technological utopianism.Thiel has cultivated a libertarian persona outlined in a 2009 essay titled The Education of a Libertarian. This fleshes out the increasing incompatibility of capitalism and democracy since the 1920s. He argues that capitalism is “not popular with the crowd”. Thiel disparages the “unthinking demos”, which has made greater demands for social democratic concessions thus constraining capitalism. Thiel is apparently obsessed with economic stagnation diagnosing that, “without a new technology revolution, globalisation’s discontents would lead to increased conflict and, perhaps, a worldwide conflagration”. He is contemptuous of the failure of imagination of disconnected elites with the danger being that people will turn against capitalism. This is supported by a 2016 Harvard study, which found that a majority of American millennials reject capitalism with a third supporting socialism. It is also in keeping with the demographic shifts driving the Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn phenomena, in turn fuelled by intergenerational injustice. Is Trump right to say Amazon is costing the US Post Office billions?Trump’s biggest campaign donor was Robert Mercer – a reclusive American hedge-fund billionaire and computer scientist. Mercer began his career at IBM working on breakthroughs in language processing integral to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). He went on to become joint CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, which applies algorithms to model and trade on financial markets. One of its funds – Medallion – is reportedly the most successful in the world. All of which has enabled Mercer to coordinate with the Koch brothers donating tens of millions of dollars to Republican political campaigns and ultra-conservative organisations. As The New Yorker investigative journalist Jane Mayer relates, both Mercer and oil tycoon William Lee Hanley had commissioned polling from Patrick Caddell ahead of the 2016 election, which showed “mounting anger towards wealthy elites, who many Americans believed had corrupted the government so that it served only their interests. There was a hunger for a populist presidential candidate who would run against the major political parties and the ruling class.” The data “showed that someone could just walk into this election and sweep it,” Caddell told me. When Mercer saw the numbers, he asked for the polling to be repeated. Caddell got the same results. “It was stunning,” he said. “The country was on the verge of an uprising against its leaders. I just fell over!”.Caddell and partners later went public with the Candidate Smith project based on the idea that the public wanted an outsider Mr. Smith Goes to Washington figure as president. Worryingly, the data also revealed that the public was yearning for a strong man to fix the country. Thiel (pictured with Donald Trump in 2016) is contemptuous of disconnected elites who he believes are turning people against capitalismAccording to The Observer, Mercer applied a big data strategy to the political scene with a $10m stake in the company Cambridge Analytica. It managed to build a 230-million-strong US voter database collecting up to 5,000 pieces of demographic, psychological, consumer and lifestyle information about each inidual with Facebook proving vital to this data profiling. The company is focused on the manipulation of psychographics – the study of personality traits – although its officials claim that this was not deployed in the 2016 US election. The power of the computer algorithms in question is such that 150 Facebook likes can be modelled to predict a person’s behaviour better than a family member. Three-hundred likes effectively means that the algorithm knows you better than a spouse. The effectiveness of this manipulation remains disputed although the power to micro-target iniduals and to induce mass effects at a population level points to sinister implications. Some authorities, such as Emma Briant (author of Propaganda and Counter-Terrorism: Strategies for Global Change), have stated that Cambridge Analytica has the technological capability to effect behavioural and psychological change.Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix told a conference in New York his company was able to predict the personality of every adult in the US (Getty)Cambridge Analytica’s parent company is British corporation SCL Group – formerly Strategic Communication Laboratories. SCL Group works on psychological operations and foreign propaganda campaigns. It collects large amounts of data about an audience in order to identify “persuadables” and target them with tailored messages.  Alexander Nix, the suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, declared at a 2016 conference in New York that, “by having hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans undertake this survey, we were able to form a model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America”. SCL has worked in more than 60 countries including Afghanistan, Libya, Ukraine and Pakistan. It “offers military clients techniques in ‘soft power’”, specialises in “election management strategies” and “messaging and information operations”. It has worked for Nato, the UK Ministry of Defence and the US State Department amongst others in “changing the behaviour of large groups”. In 2012, Facebook conducted studies involving secretive psychological testing of approximately 700,000 of its users. This was through reducing exposure to positive or negative emotional content in order to measure the effects. The study concluded: “Emotions expressed by friends, via online social networks, influence our own moods, constituting, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence for massive-scale emotional contagion via social networks.” This study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, while another Facebook project looked at how users consumed information on Twitter.According to Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda unit, one-third of all traffic on Twitter prior to the EU referendum was generated by automated “bots”, which were all pro-Leave and prior to the US 2016 election, the same automated bots were 5-1 in favour of Trump with many of them Russian. Similarly, there were hundreds of automated websites pumping out pro-Trump messages crafting a mass consensus or political climate. Reportedly, there are thousands of dormant “sleeper” bots presumably waiting to be activated during a future crisis. The war on terror has enabled the state to amass authoritarian control over iniduals. The Washington Post’s 2010 Top Secret America investigation painted a terrifying vision of the US morphing into an Orwellian big brother state.Militarisation of homeland security is now extensive. General Atomics’ Predator drones monitor the Mexican and Canadian borders through real-time, full-motion video cameras. The Department of Homeland Security collects pictures, videos and other data on American citizens. It even helped Memphis police set up a crime-analysis fusion centre fitted with walls of streaming surveillance video capable of matching army command controls, while Maryland Police have infiltrated and labelled political activist groups dedicated to human rights, anti-war and bike lanes as terrorists.This conflation of the war on terror with political activism means that the definition of terrorism is widened to include any enemy of the state andor corporate interests. Edward Snowden and Julian Assange can thus be viewed as political prisoners or exiles. The US Department of Defence has been funding research into the use of the internet for 21st century psychological operations. The Pentagon’s military research arm – the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) – has been conducting experiments on the internet in order to study social connections, propagation of messages and influence behaviour. In fact, Darpa invented the precursor of the internet – Arpanet, Darpa’s social media in strategic communication (SMISC) programme is developing algorithms for the “formation, development and spread of ideas and concepts (memes)” on social media. SMISC is channelling millions in funding for projects to corporations and academic hubs. This has included studies analysing how Occupy activists used Twitter, Twitter users’ opinions on fracking and interactions of Twitter users in the Middle East. Recent revelations suggest that Cambridge Analytica harvested data from 50 million Facebook users (Getty)The journalist Glenn Greenwald has revealed that both the NSA (National Security Agency) and its UK sister GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) have been working on exploiting social media. According to the Snowden files, this entails “propaganda”, “deception”, “mass messaging” and “pushing stories”. While GCHQ described its intentions to seed “state propaganda” across the internet. GCHQ’s Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG) is focused on “using online techniques to make something happen in the real or cyber world” including “information ops (influence or disruption)”.US defence corporation General Dynamics is also involved in information operations. This includes contracts with the Special Operations Command’s psychological operations unit to design websites in order to persuade foreigners to align views with US interests.In-Q-Tel – the CIA’s venture capital firm – has been investing in companies engaged in social media mining and surveillance. Dataminr streams data from Twitter to spot trends for law enforcement agencies and hedge funds. Geofeedia collects social media messages in order to track activists for police departments and corporations. Pathar is used by the FBI to mine social media in order to determine networks and signs of radicalisation. Netbase is capable of scanning billions of sources online and Recorded Future monitors the worldwide web to predict future events. Bruce Lund wrote in a 2012 paper that “monitoring social media” is increasingly essential for government tracking of “erupting political movements, crises, epidemics, and disasters, not to mention general global trends”. Such strategies can be exploited for counterterrorism but are also being turned against citizens by law enforcement and against activist groups by the private sector. Palantir was thus exposed in negotiations to track trade union activists and other critics of the US Chamber of Commerce. Various police departments and corporations such as McDonald’s have contracted with Geofeedia, which markets its research into student demonstrations, Greenpeace and other political movements. In 2008, an Obama adviser, Harvard law professor Cass Sunstein, wrote a controversial paper advocating the use of covert agents in order to cognitively infiltrate online groups, sites and activists. The Snowden files confirmed that intelligence agencies monitor sites including YouTube and Facebook, attempt to “control, infiltrate, manipulate and warp online discourse” and remarkably even carry out “false flag operations” in order to discredit targets.In a wide-ranging New Yorker profile, Peter Thiel told author George Packer that the failures of the establishment have rekindled his optimism pointing the way either towards libertarianism or, conversely, Marxism, although he was forced to concede that unfettered capitalism is not acceptable to ordinary Americans.Peter has cultivated a libertarian persona – a 2009 essay fleshes out what he regard as the increasing incompatibility of capitalism and democracy (Alamy)His thinking essentially represents the extreme manifestation of a growing consensus amongst elites that the status quo is unsustainable. This could lead potentially to instability, systemic collapse and civilizational crisis. In turn, this could pave the way either towards progressive, radical post-capitalist transformation that would necessarily damage vested interests – or conversely an authoritarian order designed to cement those interests. In fact, the status quo is liable to exacerbate inequality, poverty, climate change and social isions ensuring that authoritarian measures are necessary in the face of increasing rioting, disruption and social unrest. Indeed, economist and writer Joseph Stiglitz, who was previously chief economist at the World Bank, has piquantly asked how long it will be before the scenes witnessed during the Arab Spring will be replicated on the streets of America. As Thiel has put it: “The future will be much better or much worse, but the question of the future remains very open indeed. We do not know exactly how close this race is, but I suspect that it may be very close, even down to the wire. Unlike the world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of iniduals may still be paramount. The fate of our world may depend on the effort a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism.” It appears that Thiel conceives of himself as this John Galt-type heroic figure lifted straight out of the pages of Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged. The battleground of politics has expanded to include the virtual world of the internet. This is in keeping with media theorist Marshall McLuhan’s prediction that World War Three would be a guerrilla information war with no distinction between military and civilian participation. Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Speaking at the TED conference in Vancouver on Wednesday, Gwynne Shotwell said SpaceX will send humans to Mars in order to make humanity a multi-planetary species and push forward the search for alien life.“This is the first step to us moving to other solar systems and potentially other galaxies,” Ms Shotwell said. “Fundamentally you go to other places to explore. That’s what makes humans different from animals.“This is the only time I out-vision Elon: I want to meet people, or whatever they call themselves, in another solar system.”SpaceX\u0027s journey through the Solar System SpaceX\u0027s journey through the Solar System When built, the rocket needed for the Mars mission - the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR) - will have a “residual capacity” of also improving Earth-based transportation. According to Ms Shotwell, the BFR will be capable of carrying around 100 passengers at speeds much faster than current aircraft. Flying from the US to China, for example, would only take around 30 to 40 minutes. “I’m personally invested in this one because I travel a lot, and I do not like to travel,” Shotwell said. “I would love to get to see my customers in Riyadh, leave in the morning and be back in time to make dinner.”Scientists may have discovered why there are so few aliensMr Musk has frequently expressed his ambition to send people to Mars in order to form a colony that would help sustain humanity in the event of a species-ending event, such as the emergence of advanced artificial intelligence.Such technology represents “our biggest existential threat,” Mr Musk said in 2014, adding that its development was similar to “summoning the demon.”While a human colony on the Red Planet might offer some safeguards for the future of humanity, Mr Musk says the first people to take part in Mars missions would most likely be risking their own lives.“It kind of reads like Shackleton’s ad for Antarctic explorers,” Musk told the crowd at the SXSW festival last month. “Difficult, dangerous, good chance you’ll die. Excitement for those who survive.”A simulated mission to Mars by Israel\u0027s Space Agency, near Mitzpe Ramon, Israel, February 18, 2018. Rocket startup SpaceX wants to send humans to Mars within a decade. (REUTERSRonen Zvulun)Mr Musk’s timeline for beginning manned missions to Mars to set up a potentially species-saving colony is more ambitious than that of Ms Shotwell’s predictions. Last year, the billionaire polymath said he believed the first cargo mission to Mars would be possible in 2022, with the first manned mission following just two years after. The SpaceX founder does not always meet his enthusiastic deadlines, having struggled in the past to meet production goals with one of his other companies - electric car maker Tesla.Ms Shotwell referred to the wild timelines set by Mr Musk as “Elon time,” but said that the latest projections for achieving manned missions to Mars were from her own calculations.“That’s my time,” she said. “Not Elon time.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

There is no dogmatism.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13He added: What creates the problem in Ireland, is the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the EU but also to leave what it is not obligatory to leave, that\u0027s to say the single market and the customs union.The EU said last month that it is prepared to shift its position if the UK backs down over its plans for a hard Brexit.Guidelines published by the European Council ahead of the second round of Brexit talks said their position was “compatible with the positions stated by the UK” but added: If these positions were to evolve, the Union will be prepared to reconsider its offer.Sticking to EU law \u0027vastly\u0027 better than making our own, say businessesBrexit \u0027one of saddest moments\u0027 in recent European history, says TuskEU to make UK sign pledge not to slash environment rules after BrexitBarry Gardiner describes key part of Labour\u0027s Brexit plan as b******sMr Barnier’s confirmation was welcomed by anti-Brexit campaigners.Labour MP Chris Leslie, a supporter of the Open Britain group, said: These comments by Michel Barnier demonstrate yet again how ludicrous it was for the Government to take single market membership off the table in the Brexit negotiations.Leaving the single market will lead to huge economic damage, years of austerity and will starve our public services such as the NHS of vital resources.If the cost of leaving the single market and of Brexit is too high, people are entitled to keep an open mind about whether it\u0027s the right path for the country.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Nearly eight years of Tory austerity have hit their incomes, their chance to buy a house and their career opportunities.“Labour wants to help young people make the most out of life by investing in them, which is why today we are pledging the next Labour government will provide the funds to cover free bus travel for under-25s, to support them to travel to work, to study and to visit friends.He will add: “Our policy provides help where it is most needed. On average, children, young people and households with children each have less disposable income than working age households without children.“Young people also tend to be in lower paid, more insecure work, and they spend a higher proportion of their income on travel. Giving them free bus travel will make a huge difference to their lives.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

The party hopes the policy will encourage people to get into the habit of using cars only when necessary.Speaking alongside Mr Corbyn, Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, will say: “Buses are vital for easing road congestion and air pollution, but for too long, private bus companies have run our services for profit not people.How UK rail fares have risen against the cost of living since 1995“The public purse already pays 42 per cent of the costs of providing local bus services, but deregulated private companies choose to run only the profitable services and leave councils to plug the gaps left for non-profitable but vital routes.“That’s why we’ll encourage local authorities to take back control of their buses so they can provide a better and more sustainable service to young and old alike, wherever they live.”The announcement follows a worrying fall in the number of people using buses, which is now at its lowest level in ten years.In London, the reduction has prompted fears among Transport for London (TfL) executives over the state of the organisation’s finances.This, coupled with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan’s decision to freeze some fares, means TfL is facing a deficit of almost £1bn next year.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

Eight of the UK\u0027s 10 best-selling albums of 2017 were by homegrown talent, with Drake and Pink being the only outside entries. Sheeran\u0027s third album Divide was the most popular record across all formats last year and broke several industry records.Best albums of 2017Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the annual Brit Awards, said: The changes labels have made to their business models and their investment in new talent have borne fruit with rapid revenue growth in 2017.We are likely to see a continuing rise in 2018, with increasing awareness among consumers about the benefits of music streaming, and new developments that are likely to encourage the uptake of subscriptions, such as the launch of YouTube\u0027s premium music service and the growing popularity of smart speakers in the home.\u0027How did we do all that?\u0027: Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart on EurythmicsFollowing predictions that streaming would overtake physical sales in the UK last year, Taylor said that while the British music sector was in rude health, the government should prioritise creative industries in a post-Brexit world. It means making sure that UK artists can tour freely in EU markets and that UK businesses can access the best talent. It means taking firm action against illegal websites that deny artists a living, and it means making clear in UK law that huge online platforms must pay fair royalties for the music they use.If we do this, the future for British music, which is already one of our leading exports, will be very bright, he said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the reasons for his decision, according to reports, was the frustration he has working with Donald Trump.“I think we have achieved a heck of a lot. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly,” Mr Ryan said at a press conference in Washington. “But I gave it everything I could ... I have no regrets.”News of the the departure of Mr Ryan, who will serve out his term and retire in January, was first reported by Axios. “House Republicans were already in very tough spot for midterms, with many endangered members and the good chance that Democrats will win the majority,” the website said.“Friends say that after Ryan passed tax reform, his longtime dream, he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating, in part because of President Trump.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesShi\u0027ite pilgrims carry a symbolic casket outside Imam Moussa al-Kadhim\u0027s shrine to mark the anniversary of his death in Baghdad, IraqSeasonal winds washed tons of debris ashore at Matahari Terbit beach, near Sanur, Bali, Indonesia.Syrian onlookers gather around rescue teams clearing the rubble at the site of an explosion of unknown origin which wrecked a multi-storey building the previous night in the war-battered country\u0027s northwestern city of Idlib.

He took the job, with some anxieties, and with a reputation as a straight but rather uncharismatic policy wonk.Mr Ryan denied that he was resigning because of concerns about the plight of the Republicans. He also dismissed a suggestion it was because he found it difficult to work with Mr Trump.“I’m grateful for the opportunity he has given us to do big things,” he said, adding how proud he had been to help pass last year’s tax cut, the biggest since 1986.It is possible that Mr Ryan, who did not run for the presidency as part of a huge Republican field in 2016, could yet return to the political fray. Paul Ryan on Pennsylvania’s special congressional race: Both candidates ran as ConservativesMr Ryan, who said he was inspired to enter public service after reading the words of the late Russian-American novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, has long harboured ambitions about the White House, and reports suggested he could yet make another run. It is possible he could decide to be mainstream Republican primary challenger to President Trump if the billionaire decides to seek re-election in 2020, something he has indicated  he plans to do.Reports said Mr Ryan may have thought twice to publicise any planned departure, because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow Republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the House of Representatives. Yet he said he would continue to hold the position of Speaker and then stand down in January. To run for re-election in November, and then resign two months later, would be acting in an honest way to the people he represented, he said.“I really do not believe whether I stay or go will affect how a person running for congress does,” he said. “If we do our jobs, as we are, we’re going to have a great record to run on.” Mr Ryan said he had spent 20 years in congress, and that if he were to stay for one more term, his children would only know him as a weekend dad. “I can’t let that happen.”  Faith leaders arrested at DACA protest outside Paul Ryan’s office Paul Ryan suggests he has enough votes to prevent government shutdownUS Speaker Paul Ryan calls for a ‘cleanse’ of the FBIMore than three dozen House Republicans have announced that they are retiring, running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 24 seats in the November elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Mr Ryan has made little effort to hide his disdain for Mr Trump, his style as a politician or his rhetoric. After an Access Hollywood video was released shortly before the election in 2016, in which Mr Trump was recorded apparently bragging about sexually assaulting women, Mr Ryan condemned the candidate’s comments.“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” he said. “I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and works to demonstrate that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests.”It subsequently emerged that the Speaker had been even more outspoken privately. An audio recording published in March 2017, two months after President Trump had entered the White House, revealed Mr Ryan telling House Republicans at the time of the Access Hollywood’s release that he would “no longer defend” the New York billionaire.“I am not going to defend Donald Trump – not now, not in the future,” he said. “To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. “Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you.”As it was, Mr Ryan appeared to mend fences with Mr Trump, or at least pretended to, and campaigned for him in his home state of Wisconsin – a state that the brash former reality television star was able to capture by less than 23,000 votes, and which was crucial to him entering the White House.“This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,” Mr Ryan said after Mr Trump had won.“Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no else did. He turned politics on its head.”Mr Trump praised Mr Ryan after the announcement. Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question, he said.
