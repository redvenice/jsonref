Private vehicles will be allowed for essential needs only.The small northeastern state of Sikkim, bordering Tibet, on Monday also ordered a lockdown until July 27.India\u0027s top medical research body, the Indian Council for Medical Research, has asked states to add more labs and enhance their testing capacity. "},{"url":null,"title":"Michel Barnier says UK EU trade deal UNLIKELY blasts refusal compromise fishing","story":"Share this article Mr Barnier said: \u0027In June the Prime Minister Boris Johnson told us that he wanted to reach a political agreement quickly.\u0027The Prime Minister also stated three red lines.\u0027Number one no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK.\u0027Number two the right to determine future UK laws without constraints.\u0027Number three an agreement on fisheries that shows that Brexit makes a real difference compared to the existing situation.\u0027We have tried to understand how these three red lines can be squared with our commitment to a comprehensive new partnership as set out in the Political Deceleration signed by Prime Minister Johnson on 17 of October last year.\u0027He said the EU had engaged \u0027sincerely\u0027, adding: \u0027Over the past few weeks the UK has not shown the same level of engagement and readiness to find solutions respecting the EU fundamental principles and interests.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Road traffic nearly heavy lockdown","story":"Share this articleFuel dropped to as low as £1.05 per litre of petrol and £1.12 per litre of diesel in May, as oil prices collapsed due to lower demand. It follows the discovery that London is lagging behind in phone mobility data and sits bottom of the UK \u0027recovery index\u0027 as workers who usually commute are staying at home - but journeys have bounced back in commuter towns.Despite Boris Johnson\u0027s plea for workers to return to the office many of the nation\u0027s biggest companies, including RBS, Google and Facebook will allow their employees to work from home for the foreseeable future.London, which is one of the leaders in international financial services and commerce, has five business districts and is home to Europe\u0027s biggest stock exchange, generating nearly a quarter of Britain\u0027s GDP each year in normal times.  But there is a real danger of the UK economy failing to recover quickly or to anything like its pre-lockdown state unless employers and employees quash a growing appetite for continued home working in London.A think-tank called the Centre for Cities has produced a nationwide league table of UK town centres based on their current footfall compared to pre-lockdown levels, which shows London at the bottom closely followed by Edinburgh.In contrast, footfall in traditional commuter towns such as Basildon in Essex, Wigan and Chatham have bounced back as lockdown is eased and residents who would normally commute make journeys around their home towns. Centre for Cities Director of Policy and Research Paul Swinney said: \u0027London\u0027s size and the ability of many of its office-based workers to continue to work from home are likely to be the main reasons why it is having one of the slowest recoveries from lockdown.\u0027Having smaller shares of private car owners is likely to be an additional factor given that many people are still reluctant to use public transport to travel into the centre.\u0027    "},{"url":null,"title":"Charity boss sacked criticising BLMs neo Marxist agenda role","story":"Share this article A statement from Mancunian Way published on Twitter said: \u0027Mancunian Way, its trustees and Mr Buckley have confirmed a mutually acceptable statement to avoid litigation. The relationship between the parties irretrievably broke down following Mr Buckley\u0027s recent public and private statements. \u0027All trustees have made the decision to step down. A new board of trustees have been appointed and they have chosen to ask Mr Buckley\u0027s company, BNB services Ltd, to resume the provision of its support services\u0027. Mr Buckley worked for Manchester City Council for seven years before setting up Mancunian Way in 2011, which has helped thousands of BAME youngsters to secure jobs and spot the signs they are being groomed by criminal gangs.He previously told The Mail on Sunday that the charity\u0027s trustees had been put in a \u0027terrible situation\u0027 by the pressure on social media to axe him.\u0027That\u0027s why the mob wins. They make people take a step backwards and once you take one step backwards, they know you\u0027ll take another,\u0027 he said.Mr Buckley wrote his blog after protests organised by BLM UK following the killing of George Floyd by police in the US.  Writing on Medium.com on June 6 - the day protesters clashed with mounted police in London - Mr Buckley said its slogan \u0027is far too simple but is perfect for our modern age of social media and the willingness of social justice warriors to take up another cause.\u0027   He wrote: \u0027What is happening in the UK over the last few days has very little to do with the horrendous incident in the USA. \u0027It is better described as part \u0027new fashion craze\u0027 and part \u0027an opportunity for anarchy. Do you know who Black Lives Matter are? Do you know what this self-proscribed political movement wants? According to their website, they want to end white supremacy, disrupt the Western prescribed nuclear family and dismantle the patriarchal practice. These are fancy words, what do they mean?\u0027They are exactly what post-modern, neo-Marxists use when they call for the destruction of Western democracy and our way of life.\u0027  Referring to Floyd\u0027s criminal convictions, he questioned why the demonstrations were focused on the \u0027unlawful death of a career criminal\u0027 in the US rather than UK issues including knife crime, female genital mutilation, honour killings and a lack of house-building.  The response was immediate and furious. Writing on Mr Buckley\u0027s LinkedIn page, Reece Williams, a poet who works for a mental health charity in Manchester, said: \u0027Please know that we will be doing everything in our power to have you removed from your position. Expect us.\u0027A few days later, an online petition calling for Mr Buckley\u0027s removal was posted on Change.org by Karlet Manning, who also works for a mental health charity. The petition claimed his views \u0027undermine the Black Lives Matter movement whilst working in a erse community\u0027 and were \u0027inappropriate, insensitive and have since been deleted\u0027.On June 13, the row exploded on Twitter when the petition and Mr Buckley\u0027s comments began to be tweeted by Left-wing campaigners and anonymous accounts. Two days later, Mr Buckley received an email from the charity\u0027s trustees informing him their relationship with him was \u0027terminated\u0027. A red flag and the word \u0027victory\u0027 was later posted on the Change.org petition page.Mr Buckley said he stands by what he wrote, although he accepts he could have better conveyed some of his arguments. He said he had declined an offer from his trustees to issue an apology for the blog. \u0027That\u0027s the coward\u0027s way and I\u0027m not a coward,\u0027 he said. \u0027If I had the guts to say what I said, then I need the guts to stand up and continue to say what I said.\u0027 He holds no ill-feeling towards the trustees. \u0027They are lovely people but they weren\u0027t ready for a fight. They found themselves in a terrible situation not of their making - pressure online.

As Yorkshire Museum calls on collections worldwide to display their best behinds to boost attendance after coronavirus, we name our favourites Raphael died 500 years ago, it is said, after a night with his mistress left him in a weakened state. He had said that to paint perfect beauty he needed to see lots of different women. This geometrical arrangement of interlocking nudes revolving around a bottom reveals his addiction to the female body, from all angles.• Château de Chantilly, FranceThe rich lawyer who commissioned this brooding, confrontational painting probably wanted to say something about himself. Homosexuality was clearly defined in Renaissance Italy – and the myth of Ganymede, a shepherd boy carried off by the god Jupiter who had taken the shape of an eagle, was a symbol of it. Just to make it boldly clear this is about sex and violation, Mazza focuses attention on Ganymede’s naked rear.• National Gallery, LondonAn artist of supreme intelligence and irony, Velázquez takes apart the idyll of the nude in this gravely beautiful painting. Venus shows us her back and her curvaceous bottom, painted in tones of shimmering silk. But her backside is not all there is to her. In the mirror, her face is sad and uneasy. She’s not enjoying this. You realise she is not a god but a model, showing her rear for ever in a museum while wishing she was somewhere else.• National Gallery, LondonA man is slumped with his bare buttocks in the air in this stupefying triptych of the demons and perversities that besieged the early Christian hermit Anthony. But his humiliation doesn’t end there. A woman has built her house under his sheltering form. He howls in misery but can’t escape. You have to pass between his legs and under his bottom to enter the little cottage.• Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, LisbonClassical Greek sculpture is often summed up as “nude”. This has come to suggest something cold and formal: The Nude. The Motya Charioteer’s sensual behind refutes that. This captivating statue of a chariot-driver is clothed but in a garment so slinky and tight-fitting it draws attention to every contour of the youth’s body. It took genius to give this robe such delicacy in chiselled stone. And it brings us face-to-buttocks with the ancient Greek passion for male bodies.• Museo Giuseppe Whitacker, Mozia, SicilyWhen Donatello created the first free-standing nude statue since antiquity, he went out of his way to make it provocative. The artist wanted to challenge and defy the Church and its disdain for human beauty. Like the ancient creator of the Motya Charioteer, he uses clothes – in this case boots and a hat – to set off David’s physique. It’s a sort of bronze lingerie. The real shock comes when you walk around and see the statue’s opulent, geometrical, smooth buttocks. They belong with the dome of Florence Cathedral as the founding curves of the Renaissance.• Bargello museum, FlorenceNo one in Michelangelo’s lifetime doubted that his interest in the male nude was erotic. He said so himself, but insisted his adoration of male beauty was spiritual. The artist even claims as much in a love poem to a man. Homosexuality was a capital crime but, in this ecstatic monument to youth and courage, he rejoices in the hero’s rear. Picture how he lovingly carved those perfect buttocks and you’ll know what his contemporaries knew about him.• Accademia, FlorencePhilip II of Spain was in London, having just married Mary Tudor, when he took delivery of this ripely painted rear. As Venus begs her lover to stay, her rump is like a heavy cushion rooting her to the spot. Though she hugs and he pulls away, her bottom does not shift but appears glued to a heap of her discarded underwear. Titian expresses her desperation and determination to keep her man both in her shadowed face and in her immovable backside.• Prado, MadridThis is a Rococo rear. In 18th-century France, new ideas of reason and liberty were propounded by Enlightenment philosophers and discussed at such salons as that of the royal mistress, Madame de Pompadour. The art style of this optimistic age was sensually playful. Maybe Boucher’s depiction of this young woman of Irish descent boldy displaying her posterior in a luxurious boudoir doesn’t look that philosophical, but it is a libertarian manifesto of great eloquence.• Alte Pinakothek, MunichThe artist adored young men with long hair, according to Vasari’s 1550 Life of Leonardo. This is a different model of male beauty: powerful, stocky and exhibiting the best rear anyone has ever drawn. It is so expertly shaded that when you stand in front of the original drawing, it seems to be a solid, 3D pair of spheres blossoming in space. Leonardo is famous for his drawing of Vitruvian Man, holding out his limbs in a star shape to show the perfect human proportions. But this drawing is greater, stranger, with its faceless man whose centre of gravity is his rotund rear.• Royal Collection, London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/432e07b8e684765cb9f856a93f46dc79c6b6d57f/0_800_5590_3354/master/5590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0df69dac92d582edf3a9dd7bf004aecb","title":"stunning latin american photography in pictures","story":"The Bronx Documentary Center’s third annual Latin American Foto Festival features award-winning photographers from the Caribbean and Latin America displaying work from a variety of projects that focus on social issues.

Workers continue to complain of harsh deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift slightly late or off slightly early.• Said it was considering a trial to transfer 10 warehouse staff a month on temporary agency contracts to permanent deals with the retailer. Had this announcement been enacted, more than 300 additional warehouse workers would now have permanent jobs, but the warehouse remains overwhelmingly staffed by agency workers. Frasers Group said 170 workers had transferred from its agencies “under the test scheme” and that the numbers of agency workers in the warehouse had been cut, although it did not give figures.The law says workers are entitled to spend rest breaks away from their workstation if they have one, and breaks do not generally count as working time and therefore do not have to be paid under national minimum wage law.However, legal experts say that is only the case if a worker is able to spend the break how he or she wishes.Zoe Lagadec, principal at Mulberry’s employment law solicitors, said: “If the workers are not able to use their unpaid rest break freely and for their own purposes, then this time should be deemed working time and should be paid. These workers cannot be said to have taken rest away from their place of work if they are prohibited from leaving the warehouse during their only break during the working day.“Given that the workers are paid only three pence above the national minimum wage, this unpaid period of working time would breach the NMW regulations as the rate would fall below it for the whole relevant period.”Frasers Group said its warehouse workers did not have to be paid for the breaks and that the business had “no rule preventing staff leaving the warehouse during a rest break”.’s undercover reporter asked three separate direct supervisors if he could leave the warehouse during his daily break. All three said this was impossible and that the break should be spent in a staff canteen or on the smoking terrace.HMRC’s national minimum wage manual states that breaks are not typically counted as working time – but that companies should make sure the break is “genuinely taken”.The manual then points businesses to consider a separate regulation that states: “Time where a worker … is not working but is required by their employer to be available at or near a place of work for the purposes of working is treated as working time for national minimum wage purposes, even if the worker is simply waiting to be given work, is ‘on call’ or ‘standby’.“It does not matter whether during such time the employer provides any work for the worker to do, or whether the worker actually performs work. The relevant factors are the employer requiring the presence of the worker at a specified location and time of their choosing and the worker complying with that requirement.”Frasers Group said there was no legal requirement for it to provide separate facilities and, what was key, was that staff did not have to perform any duties or be at the company’s disposal during rest breaks. They said workers were allowed to use their breaks freely and for their own purposes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f361e76a5d1fe02c1fdf3e1fa8607c8339ac85c2/0_70_3726_2235/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06be0cc7749718242154a5f64ac35ae4","title":"schoolgirls in england have you been informally excluded","story":"We’d like to hear from girls – or their parents – who have been excluded from a school in England via informal methods Girls are being informally excluded at a higher rate than boys from some schools in England, according to a study by not-for-profit group Social Finance.While boys are much more likely to be formally excluded, research shows girls are being excluded through moves to other schools or by leaving one school before the end of year 11 and not finishing their studies elsewhere.

Acclaimed singer-songwriter Nadine Shah, tipped off that she hadn’t been nominated and (incorrectly) informed that alt-rock band the 1975 had, took to Twitter to protest that the award should be “for the underdogs … to highlight artists that wouldn’t get nominated for Brits”, pointing out, not unreasonably, that both awards ceremonies are run by the same organisation, the BPI.Her tweets were later removed – according to Shah, not by her, which does rather give credence to the view that the music industry is run by a shadowy committee – but, looking at this year’s nominations, she might have a point. There’s nothing wrong with the albums nominated. Critics of the Brits’ gender balance should be heartened by the sight of more female artists on the list than ever before. Michael Kiwanuka’s superb third album – a fantastic refinement of his socially-conscious soul and psychedelia – and Laura Marling’s seventh, Song for Our Daughter, are evidence of what can happen if record labels give artists time to develop. So is Hoodies All Summer, by Kano, who’s survived 15 years of UK rap’s vacillating fortunes. Porridge Radio’s uncompromising Every Bad suggests that the recent failure of indie bands to break through to mainstream success isn’t due to a lack of ideas, while Charli XCX’s Covid-19-inspired How I’m Feeling Now, written and recorded in a matter of weeks, is another demonstration of its author’s singular approach to pop. Meanwhile, if you’re going to pick a mainstream pop album, you could do worse than Dua Lipa’s fizzily exciting Future Nostalgia.What it doesn’t offer is much in the way of surprises: it doesn’t unexpectedly drag anything from the fringes – an album that’s thus far escaped wider attention – into the spotlight. A Mercury list entirely comprised of albums hardly anyone’s heard of would be a bust – accused of wilful obscurity – but at least one nomination like that would be nice. Perhaps the Mercurys’ pay-to-play policy militates against that happening: finding the £200 entry fee is obviously harder for someone self-releasing stuff on Bandcamp than backed by a label.As for what else isn’t there, it’s a long list, in which you might reasonably include J Hus’s Big Conspiracy, challenging singer-songwriter Richard Dawson’s 2020, or Rina Sawayama’s brilliantly inventive and futuristic Sawayama. Some of the absences are to be expected: the Mercury almost never nominates anything from the heavier end of rock and, in recent years, it seems to have given up on dance music and electronica, too. More surprising is its decision to stick with its time-honoured policy of one jazz album a year at a time, when the UK jazz scene is in the midst of a youthful and vibrant artistic renaissance. Perhaps this year’s nominee, Moses Boyd, will buck the trend and win: Dark Matter is precisely the kind of 21st-century British jazz album that, like the work of Kamasi Washington, could appeal to an audience far beyond the genre’s usual confines. But you wouldn’t bet on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e29f35e45dc5895cbbe82ca58f0a1df7c583fe3d/0_345_5169_3101/master/5169.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c9962453b8f2e6c3c6b13080e3c2c9e","title":"nick cave idiot prayer review livestreamed gig alexandra palace","story":"Alexandra Palace, LondonCave’s performance in an empty hall, with just piano and voice, seems to try and ward off the terrifying silence of the Covid-19 ageIn pre-pandemic times, a concert such as Nick Cave’s Idiot Prayer would have been called a solo show. Not so this one, filmed by Oscar-nominated cinematographer Robbie Ryan and billed as Nick Cave Alone at Alexandra Palace. Only a musician can be solo, the title suggests, but we can all be alone – especially now.The nod to our shared predicament is no accident: it embodies Cave’s latter-day quest to connect deeply with fans. In Andrew Dominik’s extraordinary 2016 documentary, One More Time with Feeling, Cave is shown reconciling his son’s death and finding solace in the universality of grief. Then there’s his website, the Red Hand Files, where he earnestly answers fans’ questions, an idea that spun into his Conversations with Nick Cave tour.It’s this potential for connection – more so, even, than the fancy setting and the promise of the kind of high-end production that’s been absent from so many livestreamed gigs – that presumably spurs Australians to pay $29 (or equivalent in the UK, Europe or US this evening) to access a concert filmed a month ago that can’t be paused or rewatched. And you know people are “here” because a stream of heart-eye emojis ascend from the corner of the screen. It’s the only emoji available – no poops or aubergines in the palace, thanks.In the opening shot, although it’s a hard floor, we can’t hear Cave’s footsteps as he stalks his black Gucci suit to the piano in the middle of the vast empty London hall. A prescient detail because despite Idiot Prayer being little more than artfully filmed and lusciously lit piano songs, it’s the silence that’s most notable. It seems to gnaw into the end of songs and stay throughout, too, as if Cave were singing to ward it off. Which is not to say the piano sound is swallowed-up by the cavernous space – it’s as warm and velvety as a cocker iel’s ear.The songs  most of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds’ career, reaching back to 1986 record Your Funeral, with Sad Waters and Stranger Than Kindness. As with any Cave gig, it’s a constant tussle between savagery and sentimentalism. These days, I find the former the most thrilling, such as his history-ning lyrical flexes that fan out from “the spinal cord of JFK  wrapped in Marilyn Monroe’s negligee” to “a custard-coloured super-dream  of Ali McGraw and Steve McQueen”, which we hear on Grinderman’s Palaces of Montezuma.There’s just one song from Skeleton Tree and two from Ghosteen. This is briefly disappointing until you realise if he’d played more of them, the older songs would have been unwelcome alien invaders, so all-encompassing are the worlds erected by Cave’s most recent two records.The Mercy Seat, Higgs Boson Blues and Jubilee Street are highlights and it’s perhaps no coincidence that they’re bangers compared to some of his other selections. Waiting for You, meanwhile, breaks new ground by default of Cave sounding, well, old relinquishing his baritone for a moment to sing with a strained upper range that’s as rough and real as a fraying rope.Even when viewed through the prism of parable, Cave’s songs have pathos enough to fill any palace. It means Ryan’s camerawork must resist extra flourishes at risk of the entire collaboration collapsing in on itself like a self-saucing pudding. Which fortunately, he does. Yes, there are closeups but they don’t linger longer than they should. And some of the most striking shots are from above or from quite far away, enhancing the sense of silence, loneliness and space. It’s a perplexing touch, then, to pan suddenly back to reveal a cameraman doing his thing during Higgs Boson Blues – so jarring as to seem more like a blooper than an artifice-shattering shout-out.And then, there is the light. At times it mimics the soporific golden glow of mid-afternoon, at others the bloodless blue hue of dawn. Sometimes it’s a stormy night at others a red malignant glow. As it accrues it disorients, until you feel utterly unmoored from time and place. It’s rather like another famous palace, St Petersburg Hermitage, in Alexander Sokurov’s 2002 film Russian Ark, which in the final scene you realise is not on land at all but bobbing over an unknowable sea.Ultimately, though, Cave stands up and walks away and we all click off. Idiot Prayer is over, and it is beautiful, but in the way of an object to admire from the outside because it’s too polished to crack open and crawl inside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88fdcdf92193c19f588229a4aeb85a230406dfa3/0_204_583_350/master/583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88ef3a3c0496adaefc5947d06752100a","title":"taylor swift folklore surprise album bon iver the national","story":"The singer’s eighth studio album will be released at midnight and also features production from the National’s Aaron Dessner and Jack AntonoffTaylor Swift has announced the surprise release of her eighth album, Folklore.

Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon also appears on the record, alongside Taylor Swift’s regular collaborator, Jack Antonoff. It will premiere at midnight EST on 23 July.Writing on Instagram, Swift said: “Most of the things I had planned this summer didn’t end up happening, but there is something I hadn’t planned on that DID happen.” She wrote and recorded the music in isolation, collaborating with “some musical heroes” remotely.In a statement posted on Twitter, Dessner said that Swift approached him in late April about writing together. He shared sketches that he had been working on with Swift, who sent him “a fully written version” of a song a few hours later. “The momentum never really stopped,” he wrote.Said Dessner: “I’ve rarely been so inspired by someone and it’s still hard to believe this happened.” He detailed further collaborators on the record, including the National’s Bryce Dessner and Bryan Devendorf, and many of the band’s frequent collaborators, such as Ben Lanz, Thomas Bartlett and Kyle Resnick.Swift wrote: “Before this year I probably would’ve overthought when to release this music at the ‘perfect’ time, but the times we’re living in keep reminding me that nothing is guaranteed. My gut is telling me that if you make something you love, you should just put it out into the world. That’s the side of uncertainty I can get on board with.”Folklore follows Swift’s 2019 album, Lover. She was due to headline Glastonbury 2020 before it was cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic.It is not the only surprise album planned for release this week.

It is long thought to have come from North America via steamships crossing the Atlantic.Now, French and US scientists have identified the genome sequence that holds the secret of where the phylloxera originated and how it came to spread.In a paper published in BMC Biology, the researchers say they compared the genetics of inidual European phylloxera insects with those found in wild Vitis riparia vines along the upper Mississippi, once French territory.“These genes are believed to be essential to interactions between phylloxera and grapevines. They code for small secreted proteins, called ‘effectors’, which are thought to intervene in deactivating the basic defences of the plant,” the study states.Researchers have identified Vitis riparia as the phylloxera’s original host and say it came to Europe from the upper midwest in the US – mainly Wisconsin and Illinois – though they are continuing their research along the Mississippi valley. The identified area was originally colonised by France, which held the territory until the mid-18th century when it became part of the US. The number of French settlers meant it retained important trading links with France.While now controlled in Europe, the study says phylloxera is “ever present and little known”. In wild vines in its native US, it attacks the leaves but does not kill the plant. In cultivated vines previously planted in Europe, it attacks and damages the roots leaving the plants open to fungus and bacteria that eventually kill them.Over a period of 15 years from when it was thought to have arrived in France via steamship in 1858 – it was first officially identified in the country in 1863 – it devastated vines and the French wine economy.The problem was solved by grafting European vines on to wild American vine roots that had a resistance to the insect, but it took another 30 years for the French wine industry to recover. The grafting of European vines on to American roots is a process still used today, but phylloxera is still a threat especially in Australia, and there are fears that the North American rootstocks are losing their resistance to the pest.Scientists are working on finding out what each gene does to establish how the insect affects and lives off a new host. This they hope will enable vineyards to fight the problem.They say: “This new knowledge also serves to improve our understanding of biological invasions and their potentially disastrous consequences on agriculture and therefore on society and the economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d813de2a65c229a6efb1e610e8ecb4fa1ccb199f/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc07f2929c8e1db499aa31ca63065b4","title":"wave of silence spread around world during coronavirus pandemic","story":"An unprecedented wave of silence spread around the world in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, according to researchers who found that vibrations from human activity slumped under national lockdowns.“You can almost see it as a wave,” said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist who worked on the study at Imperial College, London. “You can see the seismic quietening spread over time, starting in China in late January and then moving on to Italy and beyond in March and April.”The scientists analysed traces from a network of 268 seismic sensors in 117 countries and found substantial falls in human-generated noise in 185 of them. The largest drops were seen in busy urban centres such as New York and Singapore, but even remote stations in Germany’s Black Forest and in Rundu, Namibia, fell quieter as human activity was curtailed.“The quietening is unprecedented, at least as far as we can go back in time with continuous seismic data,” said Thomas Lecocq, first author on the study at the Royal Observatory in Belgium. Digital records of seismic activity exist from the 1970s, but paper records go back further.The findings, reported in Science, reveal that vibrations from human activity spread further than scientists expected, reaching seismometers in remote outposts or installed deep underground. “We normally try to put seismometers in quiet places, but this shows that it’s hard to get away from the noise,” said Hicks.For researchers, the sudden global quietening presents an unexpected opportunity. As the global population grows and cities swell, more people are at risk from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides driven by the geology that lies beneath them. Human activity increasingly masks the weak seismic waves that indicate slippage on geological fault lines, or early rumblings in a volcano, but during lockdown, such signals are easier to spot.“It’s important to see those small signals because it tells you if a geological fault, for example, is releasing its stress in lots of small earthquakes or if it’s silent and the stress is building up over the longer term,” said Hicks. “It tells you how the fault is behaving.”Without the human hum to overwhelm them, seismologists can more easily spot “micro-earthquakes” driven by incremental slippage along geological faults. Once they have recorded a quake from a particular fault, they can use the “fingerprint” of the tremor to look back over archived records and see if the fault has slipped before. The same goes for monitoring volcanoes near urban centres.“In cities with geological hazards, such as earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, we want to monitor and maybe get a warning of what’s going on. But with human noise increasing, it’ll become increasingly hard to see those small signals,” Hicks said. “We’re hoping this will spawn a whole new set of studies in this new field of human noise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d8845bf6b36611fcd97fefe88bf664bd8743b9/0_8_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4d6e886b62b65b0b030f35e5e02c94","title":"we started selling bikes to key workers how londons friendliest bicycle shop coped with lockdown","story":"Winston Farquharson’s passion for cycling has already seen him survive a recession – and he’s determined to make it through this challenge tooWinston Farquharson’s 30-year passion for cycling started with a rugby injury. “My doctor advised me to take up riding to help with my recovery, and I really got the bug for it”, he says as he tidies his cycle shop in Penge, south-east London, ready for the morning rush. “I joined a local cycling shop’s racing team, and travelled up and down the country to race. Sadly, though, I never quite made it.”Retraining as a sports therapist, an accident caused Farquharson to have a career rethink. “I got involved with a charity which helps disabled people back into work, and realised what I really wanted to do was run my own business. The charity supported me as I wrote my business plan,” he says.The result was SE20 Cycles, a repair and custom-build cycle shop on Penge High Street, which opened in September 2008. Since then, SE20 Cycles has become a hub for the local cycling community – so much so that last year Farquharson converted the shop’s waiting area into a coffee shop.“I wanted to create a friendly place for new cyclists and enthusiasts alike,” Farquharson says. “A lot of novice cyclists don’t like to ask questions in case they’re being silly. We wanted to avoid that, and plenty of customers have told us we’re less intimidating than many cycle shops.”When Covid-19 hit, Farquharson made the tough decision to close the repair shop to walk-in customers, putting his mechanic on furlough for six weeks, and prioritising local emergency and key workers.“As we were suddenly deemed an essential service, it felt natural to prioritise key workers in a bid to help the national effort,” Farquharson says. “For the first two weeks of lockdown, key workers could jump the queue and receive repairs at a heavy discount, or for free, which they really appreciated,” he says.“They could buy bicycles from us at trade price, too, which we started selling as a reaction to Covid-19. It meant the early weeks of lockdown saw us mostly used by NHS and other key workers.”Worried about his customers having to queue alongside shoppers waiting to go into a local supermarket, Farquharson developed an online booking system so they could book a slot for a service or repair, drop their bike off, and go.“Having two queues running side by side just wasn’t safe, so after two weeks of mayhem I spent a few hours each evening adding to and testing the booking system,” says Farquharson. “Adding stock to the site for sale was also prioritised, so people wouldn’t have to travel to us,” he says.“Initially, the system created as many problems as it solved – we had to get the message out that we were going online for booking and sales using an A-board outside the shop and social media. Online bookings are also quite hard to manage because we’re busy with the shop, and it means we don’t have the social interaction we used to with customers, which is a shame.”Customers can book and pay online, or use payment cards in store or at their doors. Other safety measures include disinfecting bikes when they’re dropped off and before they’re collected, and offering collection and delivery for customers who don’t live within walking distance. Both Farquharson and his mechanic have their own sets of tools, and spray down larger, shared pieces of equipment between each use.As lockdown eases, Farquharson plans to keep his online booking system in place, but hopes more people will visit the shop in person. “Hopefully, once lockdown eases, it will give us more space to spend with customers, and maximise our time with them,” he says. “Realistically, I also have to consider how many of the people taking up cycling now when the roads are quiet will carry on when things get back to normal,” he says.“We need to keep them cycling, so to help with that I’m introducing a booking club, where customers can pay a fee each month that will give them access to our services. We’ve got a garden at the back that I’m looking into developing, and I’m going to put some barriers up around our portion of land out front, to help with distancing. A lot of thought has to go into how shops are going to work in the future.”While Farquharson might miss the camaraderie of customers stopping by for coffee, he’s grateful to his army of loyal locals for the support small businesses like SE20 Cycles so vitally need.“A lot of shops on the high street will struggle getting people back through the doors, and small shops might find it especially hard to adapt. Local support is so important – and with Visa’s help, we can start getting people back on to the high street again.”But despite having to evolve his business in line with a constantly changing retail landscape, Farquharson is confident it will continue to thrive. “I have no doubt we’ll come out the other side of this,” he says. “I’m a plucky fella. I started out with nothing, at the height of a recession – and if I survived that, I can survive this too.”Shop local.

In 2009, she opened her own florist business, The Flower Lounge in Didsbury, Manchester.Wild says one of the main things she loves about her job is her customers. “Being nestled within such a wonderful community is really special. We’ve been here for more than 10 years, so our customers do feel like family.”The day the government lockdown was announced, Wild was floored. She was concerned for her business, her staff and the future but she also felt devastated about what the closure would mean to her customers.“Flowers are so emotive and sentimental. They’re an everyday item we use to express celebration, affection and remembrance. Often when we can’t use words, we use the gift of flowers. To have that suddenly out of people’s grasp was concerning.”Since that day, The Flower Lounge team has worked to find ways to carry on serving its community. On day two of lockdown, having already ordered a large delivery of fresh flowers, Wild and her team set about creating beautiful bunches of blooms, leaving them outside for passersby to pick up for free.Then, like many entrepreneurs across the UK, she had to reflect on the business, asking herself how it could creatively adapt and still provide a quality service.After closing for several weeks, Wild focused on the logistics of continuing the business in a safe way that would also support growers.“Without the flower growers, there would be no industry to return to. During this time, we’ve tried to support as many British growers as possible.”Happily, The Flower Lounge continued to receive inquiries from customers hoping to purchase flowers, which gave Wild confidence.“We’ve focused on seasonal blooms, offered a DIY vase kit and wreath set to replace our workshop offering, and even created a ‘drive-through’ service in the run-up to Mother’s Day,” she says.The Flower Lounge switched to contactless payments immediately and focused on understanding the needs of its customers. For example, it began to offer more plants because of their positive impact on people’s mental health and air purifying qualities.But it hasn’t been easy – 70 weddings have been postponed and 200 workshop places cancelled. Staff have been furloughed to help weather the storm.“Communication with our staff and our customers has been essential,” Wild stresses. “We recognise that not all businesses have communicated effectively, and we wanted to make this a priority.”Using its social media channels and newsletters, the shop has kept customers up to date as much as possible.“We’ve also used our social channels to share acts of kindness, such as asking our followers to nominate key workers to receive a gift from The Flower Lounge,” Wild says.Change can be unnerving, but Wild still has her entrepreneurial spirit to fall back on. In fact, she spotted an opportunity for a new service she intends to keep running as things return to normal, an online pivot that’s allowed her to be more versatile as a business.“We now offer a subscription service where customers receive a delivery of beautiful flowers that they can arrange at home. We initially offered this to help those working from home – it’s been hugely popular, so we’ve decided to keep it going.”Once she heard that shops would be allowed to reopen on 15 June, Wild couldn’t wait to flip the sign from Closed to Open – after a lot of preparation to keep everyone safe. Staff have received training and there have been changes to their working systems behind the scenes.“We’ve really missed interacting with our customers. It’s important to us that they continue to have a lovely experience and that they feel comfortable in our shop.“To achieve this, we have clear signposting, we are limiting the number of people in the shop and will continue to maintain excellent hygiene standards.“We’re also encouraging pre-orders and initially we will be cashless.”Support from the local community, friends, customers and family has been “phenomenal” and the backing from the wider business community has meant so much to Wild and her team.“I’m really happy to see big organisations such as Visa show support for independent businesses and help to highlight just how important the high street is to us all.”Shop local.

I think a lot of small businesses felt the same.”Mills usually spends her days at The Workshop, Sprout’s retail space and the hub of production for her bright and playful made-to-order clothes. Just a few minutes’ walk from Bexhill beach, it started life as a shared workspace, but as Sprout quickly grew, she was able to dedicate the whole space to her own business.A place for creativity and connecting with customers, having to close the shop was a big blow. But, after a brief dip in sales just before lockdown, which she links to customers’ collective financial uncertainty, online sales soon began to rise. “Once lockdown started, because everyone was at home buying, my online business just flourished,” she says.Underpinning such a boost in online sales is Mills’ savvy decision to expand her website and ersify into other online marketplaces such as Etsy. Where she would once open the shop six days a week and make daily post runs, Mills was only able to manage twice-weekly trips to her workshop at the beginning of lockdown because she was juggling work and childcare. Postage was reduced to once a week. But the extra time proved just what she needed. “When I wasn’t able to get to my workshop and sew, I was spending a lot more time doing computer work, and that has had a hugely positive impact on the business now,” she says. “I’ve managed to do a lot of stuff that I’ve been meaning to do for years but literally not had the time!”As well as bolstering her online presence, Mills used lockdown to work on another long-held goal: expanding into womenswear. Her new line of made-to-measure women’s underwear, crafted from the same organic, colour-clash fabrics that make her childrenswear so popular, immediately became Sprout’s bestselling range.As well as her efforts in keeping the business alive and thriving during lockdown, Mills also credits consumers thinking more carefully about what and how they’re buying. “People have been looking at more sustainable ways of buying and my stuff is all organic – that’s why I thought it was important to go into doing some adult designs. Sales of my reusable products, such as reusable wipes and makeup pads, have also been huge,” she says.Sustainability is not just an extra selling point for Sprout, it’s something that has earned Mills a loyal community of like-minded customers. While face-to-face interaction has been impossible, Mills has found her brand’s Facebook group to be an essential source of positivity and communication, spotlighting it as one of her favourite aspects of the business. An 800-strong online community share photos of their “Sproutlets”, and buy and sell pre-loved Sprout items. The latter is something Mills is particularly proud of, as it’s proof in action of the longevity of her clothes. “You’ll see this pair of dungarees will be traced back through three or four different children,” she says. “That’s the whole point of my business. They last and they’re not disposable.”While the online side of the business has been booming and her community has prospered through social media, Mills is looking forward to the social interaction that her shop provides when she reopens. “People really love being able to see and feel the quality of the clothes, and it’s lovely when someone wanders in off the street, discovers my brand and becomes a regular customer,” she says.Opening with reduced hours at first, Mills believes it will take time for the high street to get back to where it was and is grateful for support from Visa’s shop local campaign. “It’s a real positive for such a huge brand to be supporting small businesses, it’s a bare essential to us,” she says.Those who venture on to their local high street and into Sprout’s workspace will gain a renewed connection between maker and consumer, as Mills makes each piece right there on the shop floor, an unusual sight when so much of clothing manufacturing happens overseas and behind closed doors. “When parents come in with their children, they’ll sit and watch me sew for a while. I think it’s important for children to know where their clothes are from, to see how it all works,” she says. “It’s been really weird working in here with the blinds down and the door locked. I’m looking forward to opening.”Shop local.

I was utterly heartbroken and even now I can’t think about it without crying.”Read the full story‘We’ve seen the impact of coronavirus first-hand’: how one Newcastle restaurant served its community during lockdownHarissa Kitchen is relying on an army of volunteers to support those most in need across Newcastle and GatesheadJamie Sadler is the founder of Harissa Kitchen, a popular eastern Mediterranean and north African eatery in Sandyford, Newcastle.The idea of combining a vibrant restaurant, offering superb food, service and ambience, with a social enterprise has always been a dream for Sadler. So as well as celebrating foodie accolades, such as a top rating from the Sustainable Restaurant Association and a place in The Good Food Guide 2020, Harissa Kitchen doubles as a social enterprise that helps to fuel Food Nation CIC – an organisation that aims to inspire local people to live a healthier lifestyle on a low budget and improve their wellbeing through food.Now in its fourth year, the restaurant had been going from strength to strength. So when the UK imposed the national lockdown, Sadler was devastated, and understandably concerned about the future of the restaurant, his staff and the communities he serves.Read the full story‘It’s about a lot more than just money in the till’: how lockdown has shifted priorities for Southsea’s purveyor of pies and recordsSpurred on by his local community and his passion for music, Steve Courtnell is determined to open his doors once againIn challenging times, we all crave simple comforts: things like good company, good food and good music. All reasons to head to Southsea’s Pie \u0026amp Vinyl for some well-deserved self-love once lockdown fully lifts. This is the cafe-cum-record shop and community hub that puts the rave in gravy and the thrash in mash.Given that it specialises in niche interests, Pie \u0026amp Vinyl has always had to stay nimble. “We don’t take anything for granted for one second,” says Courtnell.But no amount of caution could have prepared him for what was coming in March this year, as Covid-19 suddenly hit Britain. “It felt like something from a film,” says Courtnell of the gloomy day he heard that his dream business would have to close.Read the full story‘We started selling bikes to key workers’: how London’s friendliest bicycle shop coped with lockdownWinston Farquharson’s passion for cycling has already seen him survive a recession – and he’s determined to make it through this challenge tooWinston Farquharson’s 30-year passion for cycling started with a rugby injury. “My doctor advised me to take up riding to help with my recovery, and I really got the bug for it,” he says as he tidies his cycle shop in Penge, south-east London, ready for the morning rush.“I wanted to create a friendly place for new cyclists and enthusiasts alike,” Farquharson says. “A lot of novice cyclists don’t like to ask questions in case they’re being silly and might be mocked. We wanted to avoid that, and plenty of customers have told us we’re less intimidating and more welcoming than many cycle shops, which I’m very proud of.”When Covid-19 hit, Farquharson made the tough decision to close the repair shop to walk-in customers, putting Joseph, his mechanic, on furlough for six weeks, and prioritising local emergency and key workers.Read the full story‘I’m up until two in the morning sewing masks’: the craft shop making lockdown workMaria Sammur of south London independent craft shop Really Maria explains what lockdown has meant to her, how she has kept her business open and helped the community around her‘My online art classes helped people switch off’: how creativity became a lifeline in lockdownArt shop owner Barry Whitehouse went from having no website to running virtual art classes for his local students – now, they’re joined by people from all over the worldIt may be packed into a small space, but The Artery is full of everything you would ever need to get creative. The Banbury shop is an art lover’s paradise, full of watercolour brushes, lino sets, calligraphy pens and more. Upstairs there is a classroom where owner Barry Whitehouse delivers art classes for up to eight students.“My customers range from complete beginners to professional artists and my passion is to make art accessible and affordable to everyone,” says Whitehouse. “I know all my customers by name and many are retired or ‘recycled teenagers’ as I like to call them. It is wonderful to see the positive effects learning art has, such as mindfulness, confidence building and creating communities.”In March, he was forced to close his beloved shop and put his two part-time staff on furlough. Stuck at home like everyone else, Whitehouse started experimenting with streaming his classes online direct from his dining room via closed Facebook groups. The camera was trained on his easel and he offered step-by-step instructions just as he did in the real-life classes.“Those first few weeks were about getting my older students used to new technology,” he says. “For some, my classes were the only outside contact they got all week.

Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic.“We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Read the full story‘My online business flourished’: the ethical brand that boomed when the high street shut downKaela Mills had to shut her Bexhill childrenswear shop because of the coronavirus crisis, but she soon found success thanks to her savvy decision to expand her websiteWhen the government announced its lockdown measures for the UK, Kaela Mills felt decidedly gloomy about the future of her ethical childrenswear brand, Sprout. “When everything first started, I genuinely didn’t think my business was going to make it through,” she says. “Not knowing how long the lockdown was going to last was incredibly anxiety-inducing. I think a lot of small businesses felt the same.”Mills usually spends her days at The Workshop, Sprout’s retail space and the hub of production for her bright and playful made-to-order clothes. Just a few minutes’ walk from Bexhill beach, it started life as a shared workspace, but as Sprout quickly grew, she was able to dedicate the whole space to her own business.A place for creativity and connecting with customers, having to close the shop was a big blow. But, after a brief dip in sales just before lockdown, which she links to customers’ collective financial uncertainty, online sales soon began to rise. “Once lockdown started, because everyone was at home buying, my online business just flourished,” she says.Read the full story‘A local business is different – you’re part of the community’: how a pilates studio kept spirits up by going virtualShutting down her business completely during lockdown was never an option for Michelle Smith – running classes online boosted everyone’s moraleMichelle Smith’s passion for pilates was sparked when she developed chronic back pain after a car accident, swiftly followed by heartbreak. Seeking a fresh start in Australia, she quit her job as a web designer and packed her bags.“Back in 2001, pilates wasn’t that well known in the UK – so when I saw my local gym in Australia had a studio, I decided to give it a go,” Smith says. “At first I thought: ‘I don’t understand this.’ But afterwards, I realised my back pain had gone away. When I returned to the UK in 2003, I decided to retrain as a pilates teacher, mainly so I could learn how to do it properly.”Once trained, Smith began working part-time as a teacher, meeting with clients in homes, offices and rented studios. But after having her first child with husband Ed in 2011, she decided to set up a permanent base – The Pilates Pod in Hitchin, Hertfordshire.“I’ve been teaching privately on Skype and Zoom for a long time, and looking at bringing more classes online for a while, but we’ve never had the time to do it before. Coronavirus has actually given us the time and headspace to put it into action,” she says.Within three days, Pilates Pod had gone virtual, with Zoom classes and curated content available online. Members were gifted bundles of lessons to use themselves or give away, and free sessions were offered to NHS staff.Read the full story‘The best part was seeing people, even from the doorstep’: how a Scandi baker served its Harrogate regulars in lockdownInspired by his Norwegian grandma’s cooking, Paul Rawlinson opened his own bakery bringing a slice of the Nordics to Yorkshire. But forced to lock down just as he was about to expand, what does he think the future will hold?After five years spent travelling the world as an army officer, Paul Rawlinson decided to settle down in North Yorkshire with his wife - to start a family, and launch a business that he had dreamed about since childhood. In 2012, Baltzersen’s opened in central Harrogate - a cafe where Yorkshire-sourced ingredients meet Scandinavian inspiration. Locals and tourists alike were soon hooked on the homemade smörgåsbord of delights that Rawlinson and his team had to offer.When lockdown hit, a small independent such as Baltzersen’s could well have feared for its future - especially as it had just put the finishing touches to a new off-site bakery, an expansion designed to allow it to bake its own bread among other things. But in adversity Rawlinson sensed opportunity. Within a few days, Baltzersen’s had pivoted to start selling and delivering goods direct to customers. The service quickly proved popular, and Rawlinson ran it with martial discipline, converting the cafe into a temporary “logistics base” to plan and coordinate drop-offs of up to 1,200 products a day to about 100 different homes.“We got loads of nice feedback from people telling us it was the thing they looked forward to each week,” says Rawlinson. “The best part for us was being able to still see the people who we normally would see two, three, four times a week in the cafe, even if it was just from the doorstep, giving us a wave. It was great being able to maintain that connection with our regular guests.”Read the full story‘I couldn’t wait to flip the sign to Open’: the florist who’s ready for life in-store to bloom againDriven by the desire to support UK growers and her customer base, Siân Wild found new ways to bring flowers to people during lockdownAfter spending nearly a decade training to be a florist, Siân Wild swapped her events role, and the European travel that came with it, for an opportunity to follow her dreams. In 2009, she opened her own florist business, The Flower Lounge in Didsbury, Manchester.Wild says one of the main things she loves about her job is her customers. “Being nestled within such a wonderful community is really special. We’ve been here for more than 10 years, so our customers do feel like family.”The day the government lockdown was announced, Wild was floored. She was concerned for her business, her staff and the future but she also felt devastated about what the closure would mean to her customers.“Flowers are so emotive and sentimental. They’re an everyday item we use to express celebration, affection and remembrance. Often when we can’t use words, we use the gift of flowers. To have that suddenly out of people’s grasp was concerning.”Since that day, The Flower Lounge team has worked to find ways to carry on serving its community. On day two of lockdown, having already ordered a large delivery of fresh flowers, Wild and her team set about creating beautiful bunches of blooms, leaving them outside for passersby to pick up for free.Read the full storyShop local.

It was suggested and championed by the fans,” Seattle CEO Tod Leiweke said.In opting for the sea creature of Scandinavian folklore, Seattle bypassed options like Sockeyes, Evergreens or politans, the last of which would have been a nod to Seattles hockey history. There was even a push from some fans for the team to try to acquire the Thunderbirds name from the local junior team.But Kraken was a clear favorite among fans, who rallied around the name soon after the expansion franchise was awarded in December 2018. The enthusiasm has grown since as the team built toward its debut for the 2021-22 season.It’s edgy and sounds menacing. And it gave the franchise a clear brand going forward.“I think that we felt like this is so authentic and noble, and we hit all the main things that we really wanted that we feel really strongly that this is the right choice,” Heidi Dettmer, Seattles vice president of marketing, told the Associated Press. “I’ve totally fallen in love with this brand and I think our fans will.”Seattle also unveiled its primary colors, which will be a deep dark blue almost black and a lighter shade of blue as a complement.Unlike with the last NHL expansion team in Las Vegas, there should be no trademark issues with Kraken. The Vegas Golden Knights ran into problems with the US Army and it took several years for the trademark battle to be settled.The unveiling of Seattle’s name has been expected for months, only to have it run into delays. It was first thought to be targeted for late last year in the hope of products hitting the market prior to the holiday season.Then the NHL All-Star break in January was thought to be a possibility. Then came the Covid-19 pandemic, where the initial epicenter in the US was the Seattle area.Dettmer said the name itself was chosen right around the first of the year. The time since has been spent on finalizing the primary and secondary logos while working with the leagues uniform provider, Adidas.Nic Corbett, the director of NHL relations with Adidas, said the primary logo is a Kraken tentacle shaped into an S and is a nod to the Seattle politans logo. The politans were the first American team to win the Stanley Cup in 1917.“We needed a mark that was noble and (Seattle GM) Ron Francis was someone who kept hitting that home,” Corbett told the AP. “It has to be noble, it has to be strong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4f3daf7cb776942baec2b8f89519e08b7a4ffac/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7535cc057092dca4fc086e776fa6e1de","title":"opera ballet vlaanderen dance bach mussorgsky ravel","story":"Available onlineInspired by Bach, Mussorgsky and Ravel, works from Opera Ballet Vlaanderen’s archive reveal deep classical instinctsNo matter how experimental dance gets, there remains a timeless pleasure in the marrying of movement with beautiful music. Opera Ballet Vlaanderen (previously Royal Ballet Flanders) are led by contemporary choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and they’re a progressive company (check out their lockdown series and Cherkaoui’s Mea Culpa, on Belgium’s colonial past), but their online archive shows that classical music remains an enduring inspiration.Belgian choreographer Jeroen Verbruggen takes Ravel’s Ma mère l’Oye (Mother Goose) as its muse. It’s beautiful music, but poor film recording – one fixed, wide-shot camera, noisy auditorium. Verbruggen’s not well known in the UK, so it’s still interesting to see this fairytale-ish piece. It features wili-like spirits, a la Giselle, although, rather than ethereal grace, these women (and men) bring flat-footed mischief and some galumphing. At this distance from the stage you can’t see their faces, so it’s hard to tell how comic it’s supposed to be. There are some intriguingly ambiguous relationships (a stepmothergodmother figure), but it’s difficult to read.Cherkaoui’s Exhibition, set to Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition, is much better filmed, which is just as well bearing in mind its theme is looking and being looked at. Nancy Osbaldeston (a cracking British dancer, formerly of English National Ballet) sits to watch the other bodies on stage, her eyes cast from limb to limb, thoughts whirring a mirror to what’s going on in the audience. The choreographer uses large gilt picture frames to give shape to the stage, the dancers looking out from behind them, or swallowed into them. But, unlike the subjects of paintings, Cherkaoui’s dancers are never still. His choreography is in constant, frictionless motion, tentacles of movement flowing out from a classical core. The steps aren’t gendered, but the material is more powerful when danced by the men, needing their muscle and heft to play against the soft, rubbery grace.Bach is both an obvious and intimidating choice of music for a choreographer. It comes with inbuilt gravitas, formal rigour and rhythmic momentum, but it exposes those who can’t live up to it. Choreographer Benjamin Millepied can’t quite decide how to treat this music in his full-length Bach Studies. (Indeed, he’s made more than one version of this piece.) To the mysterious majesty of St Matthew Passion, bodies fall into religious tableaux a mass of dancers skip and swirl to the cascading organ of Passacaglia in C minor. Sometimes Millepied reflects melody, structure or mood sometimes none of the above. And, confusingly, he then jettisons Bach altogether for contemporary composer David Lang – and arguably the result is more powerful.Millepied’s style is equally hard to pin down, his background rooted in classicism but his own movement more modern and matter-of-fact with influences from all over. One highlight is an engrossing female pas de deux – funny how rare that still is to see – but the best moments are solos in which the dancers connect directly with the score, and with violinist Eric Crambes on stage playing Partita No 2. Lara Fransen’s sense of phrasing suddenly transforms this into a genuinely musical dance, then the men come bounding and flying in, suspended grand jetés and entrechat sept, revealing their own deeply embedded classical and musical instincts. Here, and in all these pieces, the simplicity of that basic connection turns out to be the most rewarding thing.• Opera Ballet Vlaanderen’s ballet and opera archive is available online."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c56621199563980f3bc4cb8a16eec2cf7d33f9f/0_11_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e9925e6ddee9de104d3ed00c7327320b","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about going back to work","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have been shielding about their thoughts on returning to workFrom 1 August, those who have been shielding in England will be able to leave their homes to exercise, buy food and visit places of worship for the first time since March.They will also be able to return to work, rather than continue to work from home, as long as their place of employment is ‘Covid-secure’.If you have been shielding during the lockdown and are returning to work from August, we’d like to hear from you.How do you feel about retuning to your workplace after shielding for four months?

It is scheduled to open in December 2021.In addition, the government has already invested £93m in a state-of-the-art manufacturing innovation centre near Oxford which will have capacity to produce millions of doses of a vaccine each month.Construction has already begun in Oxfordshire on the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre, which is due to be completed in 2021.The two vaccine manufacturing sites will have the capacity to produce enough doses of a coronavirus vaccine for the entire UK population, when it becomes available, as well as vaccines which can treat other diseases.The Braintree site was built in 2017 as a fish vaccine manufacturing site, however Benchmark Holdings decided it no longer required the plant because of a change in strategy, meaning it has never been used.The company had wanted any purchaser to commit to retaining the 75 people already working at the site.Peter George, chair of Benchmark Holdings, was inspired to contact the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, after seeing him mention the vaccines taskforce during a daily coronavirus press briefing in late May.After obtaining Vallance’s email address, George said he received a response “within ten minutes”, putting him in touch with the government’s vaccines taskforce.George describes the sale of the site to the government as a “triple win”.He added that the firm sold its plant “at book value to the government, so we’re not making a profit, but the government is getting a good deal on equipment and facilities, and 80 people have got ongoing employment”.Both plants will not be open until 2021, and the government has previously invested £38m to establish a rapid deployment facility, which will open later this summer.Business secretary, Alok Sharma, said the government was taking all necessary steps to ensure it can provide enough doses for the public as soon as a successful Covid-19 vaccine becomes available.“This new Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult Manufacturing Innovation Centre, alongside crucial investment in skills, will support our efforts to rapidly produce millions of doses of a coronavirus vaccine while ensuring the UK can respond quickly to potential future pandemics,” Sharma said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44eaaf330e6cc67e0d4339d5a1ecd9a415487f33/0_0_4333_2600/master/4333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=397acc46a88c8f1aa06bd361a23204f2","title":"uk efforts to penetrate kremlin would not be shared with isc","story":"Whitehall sources argue that criticism of Britain’s spy agencies work on Russia is unfairBritish efforts to penetrate the Kremlin are kept so secret that they would not be shared with the intelligence and security committee (ISC), according to Whitehall sources who argue that the body’s criticism of their work on Russia is unfair.Critical intelligence would only be shared in a tight circle with the prime minister, senior ministers and officials – and not, even retrospectively, with the committee that concluded Britain’s spy agencies had “taken their eye off the ball” on Russia.The pushback comes two days after the release of the 50 page report which accuses successive governments and the intelligence agencies of being slow to acknowledge a resurgent Kremlin over the past decade – and failing to investigate whether Russia had sought to interfere with the 2016 Brexit referendum.“The committee is not briefed on the secret intelligence and whilst it is given some insight it does not receive single source material and definitely not as a live feed,” a former senior Whitehall insider said.They argued that the intelligence committee is “speaking from some level of ignorance” and complained that the result of the report is to “trash the reputation” of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ as they try to deal with the Russian threat.Old hands cite examples such MI6 agent Oleg Gordievsky – where the intelligence he provided was only shared with Margaret Thatcher and a handful of others in the 1980s – and add that even today, critical material about Russia is shared only on paper with a handful of people because electronic communications are not trusted.Sources describe an ongoing debate within MI5 as to how far the organisation can pivot away from counter-terrorism now that Isis has lost its territory in Iraq and Syria at a time when political concern about China as well as Russia is rising.Today’s spies are wary of criticising the ISC’s fundings – and said that the Russia report is being taken seriously across the intelligence community. They are also wary of becoming involved in rows about Brexit or anything else that could be construed as a party political matter.A key accusation in the report is that British intelligence failed to take seriously accusations that Russia had engaged in social media disinformation, using online bots and trolls, during the 2016 referendum – and only began to take the subject more seriously after the US hack of the Democratic party emails that summer.Former Whitehall insiders argue that for British intelligence to have monitored Russian disinformation at the time of the Brexit campaign would have required political direction and extra resources from ministers – at a time when the threat was less well understood.The ISC also complained that there was no “post referendum assessment of Russian attempts at interference” although former intelligence officers say that, too, would have required a ministerial decision and that neither Theresa May or any other senior minister wanted to do so afterwards once the result was clear.In its report, the ISC complained that when it began its Russia inquiry in 2017, and asked MI5 for information the agency provided “just six lines of text” which they said was “indicative of the extreme caution” that the domestic intelligence agency has around political events.Whitehall sources indicated their view at the time was that there was no high level intelligence to suggest that Russia definitively wanted the UK to leave the EU – and that on a traditional intelligence view, which is focused on the inner politics of the Kremlin, there was little to say.It is also much harder to call out the disinformation or hacking activities of Russia or any hostile state because that can entail diplomatic and political consequences, although since the Salisbury poisonings in 2018 British politicians are more willing to do so if it suits them.Last week, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, acknowledged for the first time that there had been an attempt by a hostile state to interfere in a British election. He accused “Russian actors” of spreading a leaked dossier of government emails that was picked up during the 2019 campaign by Jeremy Corbyn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79102b4212756a5d934fce52a22c2c9c6ac98164/0_48_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f6ec1d3430a207ac143b9c7d6d1af60","title":"coronavirus live news california sees record daily cases as global infections top 15m","story":"Country has world’s highest total, followed by Brazil with 2.23m cases, as the global death toll passes 625,000US governors were priming for battle against coronavirus as early as February but Donald Trump’s lackadaisical approach to the spreading disease hindered a national response, according to Maryland governor Larry Hogan, chairman of the National Governors Association.Trump initially was downplaying” the threat and saying this virus is going to disappear,” despite grave warnings from top national experts, Hogan told The Associated Press.“All of the leaders in the administration, the experts and the public health doctors at the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), they were aware and providing this information.

The US has now exceeded 140,000 deaths, with Texas alone reporting a state record 197 new fatalities on Wednesday.Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, is again coming under fire after being caught on camera chatting with cleaners on the grounds of his official residence without a mask - despite testing positive for the coronavirus only yesterday.The far-right populist, whose dismissive response to the pandemic has been globally condemned, first announced he had been diagnosed with Covid-19 in early July, when Brazil had suffered more than 65,000 deaths and 1.6m confirmed cases.Since then Brazil’s death toll has risen to nearly 83,000 - the second highest in the world – and the number of cases to 2.2m, a record 67,860 of which were recorded yesterday.Brazil’s president again tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday and has supposedly been in isolation since 6 July.Despite that Bolsonaro – who has undermined social distancing efforts and repeatedly downplayed the illness as a “bit of a cold” – was on Thursday spotted by a Reuters photographer roaming the estate around Brasília’s Palácio da Alvorada on a motorbike and talking to cleaners without gear to protect them.New York City has reached its goal of performing 50,000 coronavirus tests a day and its contact tracing effort has potentially prevented thousands of new infections, officials said.Mayor Bill de Blasio said four new clinics operated by the urgent care company MedRite will bring the total citywide daily testing capacity to 50,000.“This is the number we’ve been wanting to get to for quite a while. We will now have that capacity,” he said.Dr Ted Long, the head of the city’s contact tracing effort, said the average wait for test results citywide is now two days, down from more than double that a week ago, but he acknowledged that waits at some testing sites have been much longer.The African Development Bank said it would provide $285 million in aid to Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad to help them fight the coronavirus pandemic.The aid was being provided within the framework of a $10-billion Covid-19 response facility unveiled by the AfDB in April.Niger would receive support of $108.8 million, Burkina Faso $54.6 million and Mali $48.9 million in both loans and grants, a statement said.Chad would receive $61.2 million and Mauritania $10.2 million in the form of grants.“The board of directors of the AfDB has approved budgetary support of $284.8 million to help the efforts of the Sahel countries - Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Chad - in implementing their response plans to the Covid-19 pandemic and economic recovery,” the pan-African bank said.The aid “is particularly important for the G5 Sahel countries which are already suffering from climate, humanitarian and security shocks,” said the bank’s director general for West Africa, Marie-Laure Akin Olugbade. Bolivia’s general election will be pushed back until October 18 due to the pandemic.The head of the electoral tribunal said on Thursday that the vote would be postponed from the previously scheduled September 6 date to ensure the safety of voters, with hospitals and cemeteries straining under the impact of the virus.“This election requires the highest possible health security measures to protect the health of Bolivians,” tribunal President Salvador Romero told a news conference in La Paz.The vote is key to the political future of the Andean nation of 11.5 million people after a fraught election last year sparked widespread protests and led to the resignation of the country’s long-term leftist president Evo Morales.In a political vacuum and amid deadly conflicts on the street, right-wing lawmaker Jeanine Anez was ushered into power, pledging to hold quick new elections, originally planned for May before being delayed by the pandemic to September.Anez is running in the election, while Morales is pulling the political strings from exile in Argentina with his Movement for Socialism party, whose candidate Luis Arce leads in some polls.Morales wrote on Twitter the delay “will only harm the people” and blamed the interim government for its response to the pandemic. He added the move was unconstitutional and a tactic for his opponents to “gain more time.”Anez said she would accept the new date.“Whatever the date, the government calls for promoting economic revival, the fight against the virus and the consolidation of democracy,” she wrote on Twitter.The new election schedule would see a second-round held on November 29 if there was no clear winner in the first-round vote.It took only 15 days for the total number of coronavirus cases in the US to go from 3 million to 4 million.In contrast, the number of US coronavirus cases surpassed 1 million 99 days after the country’s first case was confirmed.The US currently accounts for about a quarter of all confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.The US hit the grim milestone of four million cases a day after Fox News aired an interview with Trump in which the president argued coronavirus tests are “overrated.”“To me, every time you test a case it gets reported in the news, we found more cases,” he said. “If instead of 50 we did 25, we have half the number of cases. So I personally think it’s overrated, but I am totally willing to keep doing it.”As the US passes 4 million coronavirus cases, Donald Trump is expected to address the media shortly in Washington.Meanwhile, Florida, which reported a record one-day increase in Covid-19 deaths on Thursday with 173 lives lost, has been sued by a teachers union to stop schools reopening for in-person instruction, which the union says poses an imminent threat to the health, safety and welfare of children, staff and parents.Florida’s commissioner said early in July that schools must reopen, but on Thursday Governor Ron DeSantis said parents and teachers had a choice.“We need to provide all options,” DeSantis told a news conference.Trump, who has threatened to withhold federal funding if schools do not reopen, told a press briefing on Wednesday the decision would ultimately be up to state governors.Administration officials have said a quicker reopening is essential to get the cratering economy moving again, another central plank of Trump’s re-election campaign.The number of coronavirus cases in the US has now surpassed four million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.The US has confirmed 4,005,414 cases since the start of the pandemic, the highest of any country.Brazil has the second highest total in the world with around 2.23 million cases followed by India with 1.24 million.Here are some more comments from the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s address to the nation.He said it is investigating dozens of alleged corruption cases involving theft or misappropriation of funds earmarked to fight the coronavirus pandemic.A special investigating team had been set up to look into “allegations of corruption in areas such as the distribution of food parcels, social relief grants, the procurement of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies,” Ramaphosa said.“At least 36 cases are currently at various stages of investigation and prosecution.”In April, the government announced an unprecedented 500-billion-rand ($26.7bn) economic stimulus and social relief package to cushion the impact of coronavirus.But some of those funds have been stolen, misused or relief food aid has been erted from households in need.Ramaphosa vowed that all alleged corruption cases would be “thoroughly investigated”, culprits prosecuted and the stolen money recovered.Corruption involving state assets worsened during the nine-year tenure of the former president Jacob Zuma.Zuma was forced to resign in February 2018 over graft scandals and Ramaphosa took over vowing to tackle corruption.South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said public schools will close again for a month from Monday to limit the spread of coronavirus.The country has now recorded 408,052 coronavirus cases, the fifth-highest in the world. More than 6,000 people have died from the virus.Rising infections have caused concern among teaching staff, with unions calling on the government to revoke its decision to reopen schools for certain grades in June.“Cabinet has decided today that all public schools should take a break for the next four weeks,” Ramaphosa said during an address to the nation, adding that the academic year that is due to end in December would be extended.Schools will be closed from 27 July and scheduled to reopen on 24 August.“We have taken a deliberately cautious approach to keep schools closed during a period when the country is expected to experience its greatest increase in infections,” Ramaphosa said.The president also announced a “historic” R500 billion ($30bn) social relief and economic support package to fund the health response and assist “those in greatest need”. The director general of the World Health Organization has criticised the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, for “untrue and unacceptable” allegations” about the health agency chief’s relationship with China. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said WHO was focused on saving lives as he condemned the reported comments by Pompeo at a closed-door event this week in London.British newspapers reported that Pompeo claimed Tedros had been bought by the Chinese government.“The comments are untrue and unacceptable, and without any foundation for that matter,” Tedros told reporters in Geneva.“If there is one thing that really matters to us and which should matter to the entire international community, its saving lives. And WHO will not be distracted by these comments.”Critics say the Trump administration has been trying to deflect attention from its own failings in managing the coronavirus outbreak in the US, which has the most confirmed cases and virus-related deaths in the world.In recent months, the administration has repeatedly criticised WHO’s handling of the pandemic and its alleged deference to Beijing. Donald Trump has ordered the US to withdraw next year from the agency it has bankrolled and supported for decades. The White House has released a readout from Donald Trump’s call today with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.“Today, President Donald J Trump spoke with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. President Trump and President Putin discussed efforts to defeat the coronavirus pandemic while continuing to reopen global economies,” the readout says.“The two leaders also discussed critical bilateral and global issues. President Trump reiterated his hope of avoiding an expensive three-way arms race between China, Russia, and the United States and looked forward to progress on upcoming arms control negotiations in Vienna.”The readout makes no mention of Trump pressing Putin on reports that Russia offered bounties to Taliban insurgents to kill American troops.The US president also does not appear to have asked his Russian counterpart about allegations that Kremlin-backed hackers targeted coronavirus vaccine researchers in the US, the UK and Canada.South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, says the country’s coronavirus cases have risen above 400,000.Ramaphosa said the cabinet had decided that all public schools should be closed for the next four weeks with some exceptions."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312168.1595532969!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"travel insurance for green list countries to operate as normal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government is still urging the public to avoid foreign holidays this year based on public health advice.  Photograph: Getty ImagesTravel insurance relating to the 15 countries named on the Government’s newly published “green list” will now operate as normal, the industry confirmed on Thursday. Following some confusion the lobby group Insurance Ireland said the main providers of cover would now operate subject to normal terms and conditions. In a statement it said that as the Department of Foreign Affairs had updated its travel advisory for the named countries from “essential travel only” to “normal precautions”, regular services could resume. “Consumers should check directly with their insurer, and should also be aware that the green list will be reviewed on a fortnightly basis and is subject to change,” it said. Earlier this week insurers had sought clarity on official advice regarding overseas travel to the so-called green list countries.Until Tuesday the Department of Foreign Affairs had a blanket advisory warning against non-essential travel outside of Ireland – anyone who disregarded that would automatically void their insurance cover. With the publication of the green list the status of those countries was changed to “general precautions”, prompting the change in position from providers. However, the Government is still urging the public to avoid foreign holidays this year based on public health advice. Malta, Finland, Norway, Italy, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Cyprus, Slovakia, Greece, Greenland, Gibraltar, Monaco and San Marino have been included on the green list. The development was quickly welcomed by insurer Multitrip. com, which said holidaymakers were now free to travel “with peace of mind” to those named destinations. It said it would now “cover cancellation as a result of a positive Covid-19 diagnosis on their policies with immediate effect” .The company said it would add this cancellation cover to existing policies and cover medical expenses abroad resulting from Covid-19 illness. DiagnosisWhile it is as yet unclear what other providers will do, Mulittrip said its policy could now cover cases affected where a traveller, their companion or any person they had arranged to stay with had received a diagnosis. “We are delighted that the GovernmentDepartment of Foreign Affairs has changed their advice following pressure from the insurance industry and have given clarity,” said managing director Ciaran Mulligan. “Irish holidaymakers can now travel with peace of mind knowing that they are covered by their travel insurance if they travel to the countries on the green list. We would also call on the Government to review regions as well as countries when they are updating their list in the next two weeks.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4308213.1595171560!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"learning online when school is a nine hour drive away","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDawn Bateman (right),  her husband Chris and children Samy and Pippa are pictured at their home in the Northern Territory in Australia.  Dawn Bateman grew up on the remote and beautiful Horn Head near Dunfanaghy in Co Donegal, attending Holy Trinity National School and later Pobalscoil Chloich Cheannfhaola in Falcarragh. Today, Bateman and her husband, Chris, manage a 2.3 million acre farm in Australia’s Northern Territory and their children, Samy (4) and Pippa (3), are embarking on a very different educational experience.The nearest town, Katherine, is a six-hour drive away, and the family rarely visit. “We get all of our supplies delivered to Cape Crawford, a little roadhouse. A truck comes twice a week on a Wednesday from the food stores and on Friday with general freight. So we get everything pretty much delivered there or via mail plane once a week. We’ve got an airstrip on the property,” Bateman says. Samy started school this year and, like hundreds of other children living in remote areas across Australia, he is enrolled in a branch of the School of the Air (Sota). The school itself is in Mount Isa in Queensland, about a nine-hour drive away, but all of its 155 students learn remotely. The first of these schools was set up in Alice Springs in 1951 to provide accessible education for isolated children in outback regions of Australia, initially using high-frequency radios. Today, classes are conducted online, with follow-up activities done at home with the help of parents or tutors. For now, Samy’s classes are part-time and largely play-based. “It’s almost like a Zoom meeting...it’s pretty fun getting a heap of four-year-olds together,” Bateman says. “It’s like mustering cats but it’s good for him to talk to other kids.”Next year, when Pippa starts school, the couple will look into getting a tutor. “I know next year it gets a bit more serious and they have their on-air classes and they have set modules they have to complete. They have to do exams and it’s the same curriculum as the other schools. It definitely is difficult and that’s why people employ a governess, as it’s really a job in itself.”SocialiseBateman says she goes the extra mile to make sure her children socialise despite living in a remote part of the country. “You just have to do your best and get them mixing as much as possible.”She says many isolated children cannot participate in school sports or learn to swim as they’re so far away from any facilities. But a rural parents’ organisation has set up an annual sports camp so their kids can have that opportunity. “They do everything they do tennis, they do soccer, they do dance, they do gymnastics and they jam it all into a week. The kids are fried by the end of it.”Bateman says she also takes Samy and Pippa to rodeos in the winter, which is from June to August in Australia, to socialise with other kids but many were cancelled this year due to Covid-19 restrictions. “I didn’t think I’d miss them as much, but I most certainly did.”GovernessAishling Murphy moved from Wexford to Brisbane six years ago. After a few months in the city, she moved to outback Queensland and worked on a cattle station as a tutor, or governess as they are often referred to. Her role was to help the children on the property with their online education and school work. “If there was cattle work to be done we would go out and do it and school would happen when we got back. It kind of changes around the life timetable of home,” Murphy says. She now works as a teacher in a rural primary school, with just 16 students. When schools across Queensland closed for five weeks in April due to the pandemic, her experience as a tutor helped her to understand the balance parents at home had to find when trying to juggle work and overseeing the education of their children.“Most parents won’t have a background in education. I think they need to not be hard on themselves...Sometimes it just doesn’t flow,” Murphy says. “We were very lucky in that all of our kids had laptops and the kids were quite skilled on the computers already. We use the likes of Blackboard Collaborate. It’s like Skype and all of our distance education schools would use that for web conferencing with the kids.” Homework is sent to parents and children with explicit instructions, checking in with parents and then letting students talk to each other at the beginning of a lesson helped navigate the new way of learning. “Kids just want to talk to each other. I would have seen it too when I was a governess and during the first five minutes of the session we just let the kids talk. They want to get that out of their systems,” Murphy says.

File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe HSE’s chief clinical officer, Dr Colm Henry, has warned everyone will have to find a way of living with the ‘new normal’ of life in the time of Covid-19.Dr Henry said he supports people getting back to work, as suggested by Ibec, but said that apart from inidual responsibility, employers have a responsibility to ensure their employees are safe.The ‘new normal’ had to include minimum contact, avoiding crowds and avoiding close contact, he told Newstalk Breakfast.When asked about school uniforms and if it was safer for children to wear their own clothing, Dr Henry said that was a decision for each school, but he felt if good hand hygiene and social distancing measures were implemented that would be effective.Dr Henry said the health service had suffered “an unprecedented shock to the system” and that there will be a fall in capacity as social-distancing measures are observed. He expressed particular concern over the worrying trend of outbreaks of the virus in congregated settings such as the workplace and social gatherings. Dr Henry was also concerned about the number of people declining to be tested when identified as a contact of a person who had contracted the virus. “It is worrying. If you are called you should go for the test.”Dr Henry pointed out that 6 to 7 per cent of asymptomatic people who had been tested were diagnosed with the virus. “People are not the best judges for themselves if they need the test.”One further death of a person with Covid-19 has been reported to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, while there have been a further 17 confirmed cases.There has now been a total of 1,754 Covid-19 related deaths in Ireland, while the total number of confirmed cases stands at 25,819.Dr Ronan Glynn, acting Chief Medical Officer, appealed to the public to continue social distancing.Currently, there are 14 patients in hospital with Covid-19, with six of these in intensive care. Three people were admitted to hospital in the past 24 hours.The total number of people hospitalised stands at 3,340 with 438 of these requiring intensive care treatment.A further 4,599 tests were completed in the past 24 hours bringing the total figure to 579,088.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe .Opposition TDs have condemned the Government over the introduction of legislation to ensure that all three ‘super junior’ Ministers are paid an additional allowance of €16,288 for sitting at Cabinet.The legislation is expected before the summer recess and Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said the move “sends out all the wrong signals”.Labour finance spokesman Ged Nash described the idea as “absolutely tone-deaf to the day-to-day needs of families across the country”.During a debate on revised estimates of some €42.7 million for salaries and expenses in the office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr Doherty hit out at Fianna Fáil. He said that when the party was in opposition it said it was “adequate to have two super junior ministers and that it is not a matter for the Dáil to pass legislation to solve an informal Fine Gael demotion or promotion issue”. Mr Doherty asked “what has changed” since then and said “we know that Fianna Fáil could never be trusted”. “The only thing that has changed is that it is now the beneficiary of the super junior Ministry and the bump of €16,000,” he added.Annual allowanceUnder current law two ministers of State who sit at cabinet are allowed an extra €16,288 annual allowance along with their ministerial salary of €124,439.In the last government, even though there were three super junior ministers, just two - minister of State for defence Paul Kehoe and minister of State for disability Finian McGrath - received the allowance. The then minister of state for higher education Mary Mitchell O’Connor was ineligible because of the law.The three new super juniors who will receive the payment are Fianna Fáil’s Government Chief Whip Jack Chambers, Fine Gael’s Minister of State for Climate Change and Transport Hildegarde Naughton and Green Party Minister of State for Agriculture Pippa Hackett, who is a senator.Mr Doherty hit out at the “priority of the Government” to introduce such legislation in the middle of a pandemic “when cancer patients cannot get medical cards, people are seeing their PUP (pandemic unemployment payment) being cut and students are wondering how they will get back to school”. Mr Doherty and Mr Nash criticised the failure of Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath to attend the debate. Minister of State Patrick McGrath said he was at a Cabinet meeting.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar on Tuesday also missed a Dáil debate on enterprise legislation because of a Cabinet meeting.Mini-stimulusMr Nash claimed the Government had been creating its own mini-July stimulus package for itself with a “near-record 20 junior Ministers”, 17 special advisers soon to be appointed to work with the three Coalition party leaders and “now three super junior Ministers will receive an additional €16,000 each in allowances”. He said “this is a very anxious time for families and businesses, but there is no sign whatsoever of the Government tightening its belt and acknowledging or understanding the pain and difficulty in which many people find themselves.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312185.1595534544!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state absolutely on track for september reopening of schools","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Dr Ronan Glynn, acting chief medical officersaid Dr Glynn said the spread of the virus had stabilised over the past week. Photograph:  Colin Keegan CollinsThe country was “absolutely on track for children to go back to school in September” based on how the Covid-19 infection rate has stabilised, the State’s acting chief medical officer said.Speaking at the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) briefing on Thursday, Dr Ronan Glynn urged people to keep following public health advice and to stay physically distant over the next five weeks to reduce the rate further “to achieve that aim of getting children back to school”.Reopening schools was one of three priorities for the NPHET, he said the others are reopening healthcare services and protecting the most vulnerable in society.Nine further coronavirus-related deaths and seven new confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported by NPHET on Wednesday, bringing total deaths to 1,763. Dr Glynn pointed out that eight of the deaths were late notifications and had occurred in April, May and June. Death registerHe said that late notifications were “not unusual” as deaths did not have to be official registered for three months. He recognised that this was a “difficult time” for families but he urged them to register deaths “as quickly as possible so it can feed into our decision-making process”.The new confirmed cases of the disease brought the total number to 25,826.Dr Glynn said the spread of the virus had stabilised over the past week after transmission had increased over the previous two weeks.“It is absolutely early days. Last week we were uncertain and worried. The week before we were uncertain and pessimistic. This week we can be uncertain but optimistic,” he said. Professor Philip Nolan, chair of Nphet’s Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, estimated that the reproduction rate or “R” number was about 1.1 but “could be as high as 1.4”.Anything over one indicates the virus is still spreading below means it is being suppressed.A figure of 1.4 means for every five people infected by the virus it will spread to seven others. Reproduction numberThe estimated “R” number was down from between 1.2 and 1.8 a week ago.Prof Nolan said that there were 18 new Covid-19 cases being confirmed every day on average over the past week, compared with 19 a day last week and nine a day four weeks ago.“This week, it seems that we have achieved some level of stability,” he said.He said that it was “too early to tell” for certain that the infection rate had stabilised.Health officials would have to see this continuing “for a week to 10 days before we would be comfortable to say that we had arrested the increase in cases”, he said.Still, he said that this was “good news” that the public had shown that they had reduced the transmission by taking inidual actions on the back of warnings over recent weeks. Dr Glynn said the latest data on Covid-19 in the State was “the start of something positive and we need to see it continue in the same way over the coming weeks”.He told the briefing that it was “too early” to decide whether remaining pubs, which do not serve a substantial meal, could reopen again on August 10th. Asked whether he was fearful that reopening pubs first would prevent schools reopening, he said that pubs were “one of the highest risk environments” and that a decision would have to be taken on whether to reopen them in two weeks’ time based on where the virus was then. “We can’t do anything to jeopardise the overarching priorities,” he said. Median ageOver the last 14 days, 272 new confirmed cases of the disease were notified to Nphet, while 183 people were infected over that period giving an infection rate of 3.8 for every 100,000 people.Dr Glynn said that of the 272 cases the median age was 38 years of age and that 58 per cent of the people infected were under the age of 45. A third of the infections were healthcare workers.Dr Colm Henry, the HSE’s chief clinical officer, said there was a sense among some young people that they were “invulnerable” to the disease and this had led to the drop in the median age of people becoming infected and a reluctance by some to come forward to be tested.He said the average number of close contacts of infected young people being identified was as high as eight or nine, much higher than the average of five across all cases.SuppressionEarlier on Thursday, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly described the reduced Covid-19 rate as “some good news” although the number of cases per week has been rising.It had gone in the last four weeks “from 61 cases in a week, up to 93 cases, then up to 124 cases, And last week we hit 143 cases.”But he added that “at the same time the average close contacts is still quite high and more than five”. The Minister told TDs that 51,000 tests had been carried out in the last week.“And we have a very low positivity rate of 0.3, which suggests that the prevalence of the virus in the population is low”.Social Democrats TD Roisin Shortall said she had been told that only 7 per cent of people arriving in Ireland are contacted about being in self-isolation and only half of those who are contacted take the call. That meant only 3.5 per cent of passengers were followed up on and this was “unbelievable” given the sacrifices the public had made to suppress the virus.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312215.1595536505!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"stimulus package is largest cash injection into irish economy in history","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste  Leo Varadkar and Taoiseach  Micheál Martin.  Combined with in excess of €2 billion in loan guarantees, the total stimulus package amounts to some €7.4 billion, officials said. Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyTaoiseach Micheál Martin, along with the leaders of the other Government parties, Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan, on Thursday announced the long-promised July stimulus package, including more than 50 inidual measures “which collectively address every significant area of economic activity in our country”, Mr Martin said.He outlined a series of business funding schemes, worker supports, tax cuts and capital investments totalling over €5 billion which will be rolled out over the coming months. The vast bulk, he said, would be pumped into the economy this year. Combined with in excess of €2 billion in loan guarantees, the total stimulus package amounts to some €7.4 billion, officials said. It is the largest cash injection into the Irish economy in history.Mr Martin acknowledged that the package would be funded by “a major increase in our public borrowing”.“It is our assessment that this is proportionate and necessary for a range of economic and budgetary reasons,” he said. “The increased borrowing which we are announcing today is in line with what is happening in Europe and internationally. A combination of lower financing costs, the major EU reforms implemented over the last decade, and the shared nature of the stimulus spending means that this extra borrowing is sustainable.”RecoverMr Martin said that many of the measures were designed to help inidual businesses stay going during the pandemic, and to help them recover once it has passed.“The critical issue of tight cash flows which is threatening many businesses will be addressed through measures such as changes to the payment of key taxes and the provision of low-cost financing,” he said.Mr Martin said that capital funding would be provided to every school to assist with refurbishment, including renovations needed to help schools reopen during the pandemic. He said that there would be support for new town and village renewal schemes.There would be additional money for “the national retrofitting programme, peatland restoration and improved public transport” which he said would “create jobs and help in addressing urgent environmental goals”.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Leo Varadkar said that the package was “bigger in scale than most budgets and will be deployed at speed”.“It is designed to help businesses to open, to help those that are already open to stay open, to get staff back to work and for those who cannot go back to their old jobs, there are new opportunities,” he said.‘Grit’He paid tribute to business owners, who he said have “shown remarkable grit, determination and adaptability in the face of unprecedented challenges”.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said the Government is investing in funds for more walking and cycling facilities and rural greenways to allow people to “connect to nature in a better way”.He said he would be asking all the local authorities in the coming days and weeks to “seize the moment and bid for some of these funds and the jobs they will bring”.He also said there would be upgrades to national parks, nature reserves and heritage and tourism sites. A retrofitting programme would be undertaken, he said, which will be “labour-intensive work . . . sending a strong signal that it is time to start hiring and training workers in this sector.”He said it would be a “practical example of the huge change we will be making as we meet our climate goals”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312034.1595531742!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"surprise defeat for government as catherine connolly becomes leas cheann comhairle","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDeputy Catherine Connolly’s team estimated that around 15 Government TDs voted for her in the secret ballot. File photographIndependent TD Catherine Connolly is the new Leas Cheann Comhairle of the Dáil after a shock victory over Fine Gael candidate Fergus O’Dowd.The Galway West deputy is the first woman to hold either the role of Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the 101-year history of the House, winning by a margin of 77 votes to 74 in a secret ballot. The result marked the first Dáil defeat for the Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael-Green Party coalition and is being seen as an embarrassment given its majority in the House. An estimated 15 Government TDs voted against Mr O’Dowd. Ms Connolly received a standing ovation from her colleagues on Thursday night when the result was formally declared. Ceann Comhairle Seán O’Fearghaíl described her election as “historic” and a great occasion and acknowledged the “distinguished” campaign run by Louth TD Mr O’Dowd.Ms Connolly (63) and Mr O’Dowd (71) were the only two nominees. The position usually goes to the Opposition but Mr O’Dowd, who had the nomination of the coalition parties, had been expected to win.Speaking before the formal declaration, Ms Connolly said it was an “absolute privilege” to be appointed to the job. She said she expected to finish a “good second” with support from the opposition parties rather than to win.Ms Connolly had decided to run because “we complain about gender inequality” and there was only one other, male ,candidate.Opposition TDs were surprised at the outcome given the coalition’s numbers, which did not hold up in the secret ballot. There was speculation about a mutiny in the Fianna Fáil ranks, with one of the party’s TDs saying “the Government didn’t bring out the government vote” and that the defeat was “worrying given the need for stability”.Some Fine Gael TDs were said to be unhappy that those who selected Mr O’Dowd as the candidate had overlooked Bernard Durkan. The Kildare North TD, known as the ‘father of the Dáil due to having the longest record of service, regularly stands in as acting chair in the House. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said he was “disappointed that Fergus didn’t get elected because I supported him”. He said it was a secret ballot which “speaks to the autonomy of the parliament. “Parliamentarians will decide in terms of the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Ceann Comhairle,” he said. “But I can’t speculate any further than that...I think it’s parliament taking its decision. I’m disappointed for Fergus, he’s a very experienced parliamentarian. I wish Catherine the very best. She’s an able chairperson as well.”With 151 of 159 TDs voting, it emerged that two Government TDs were unable to attend because of government business and were “paired” which meant two opposition TDs agreed not to vote. A fifth TD was absent for health reasons and three other TDs did not vote . Voting took place at the Convention Centre in Dublin, where the Dáil is sitting on some days to allow better social distancing amid the pandemic. The role carries an additional allowance of €38,787 on top of a TD’s salary of €96,189.A Government TD who planned to vote for Mr O’Dowd said they changed their mind after being “struck” by Ms Connolly’s comments about there never having been a female Ceann Comhairle or Leas Cheann Comhairle.Ms Connolly has been a TD since 2016. She was a councillor from 1999 until her election to the Dáil, serving as mayor of Galway.Mr O’Dowd, a TD since 2002, is a former minister of state, senator and councillor who served three times as mayor of Drogheda.

Photograph: Jerome Favre EPAMore than 15.2 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded worldwide with more than 623,000 deaths, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University. The three worst-hit countries – the US, Brazil and India – account for nearly half of all confirmed cases globally and more than 40 per cent of fatalities. A World Health Organisation (WHO) expert said the first use of a vaccine cannot be expected until early 2021.The following is a summary of the latest developments on the virus around the world:AustraliaAustralia reported its highest daily number of coronavirus-related deaths in three months on Thursday as new infections continued to climb in its second most populous state. Victoria state said it had confirmed another 403 infections, while five people had died from the virus in the last 24 hours. The fatalities, including a man in his 50s, mark the country’s biggest one-day rise in Covid-19 deaths since late April. “This demonstrates the growing toll this terrible virus is taking on our community,” health minister Jenny Mikakos told reporters in the state capital, Melbourne. With authorities unable to bring new infections below triple digits, residents in Melbourne and most of the state are now required to wear masks outside of their homes. Nationally, Australia has recorded about 13,000 coronavirus cases with a death toll of 128.The rise in new infections came after Australia began relaxing strict containment measures imposed in mid-March. While the social distancing rules - which limited mobility of residents and shuttered businesses - slowed the spread of Covid-19, Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it has taken a heavy toll on the economy. The government reported its biggest budget deficit since the second World War on Thursday after committing to fiscal stimulus of around A$289 billion, or 14.6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Australia is experiencing a health and economic crisis like nothing we have seen in the last 100 years,” Mr Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra.AmericasBrazil reported a record number of coronavirus infections, days after the WHO said the country had reached a plateau. The Latin American country registered 67,860 new cases on Wednesday, more than 20 per cent above the previous record for daily infections. The numbers of Covid-19 cases added in the last 24 hours pushed the total to 2,227,514. Deaths rose by 1,284 to 82,771, according to the health ministry. Brazil, a nation of 210 million with some states the size of France, trails only the US in both case and death counts. The numbers, while still high, have stabilised in recent weeks, the WHO said Friday. It urged Brazil’s government to seize the opportunity to take control of the virus.Neighbouring Argentina posted a daily record of 5,782 confirmed cases, the vast majority of them in and around the capital, Buenos Aires, taking the total number infected in the country to 141,900. Peru, which has the second-highest number of cases in Latin America behind Brazil, added 3,688 previously uncounted people to its death toll on Wednesday, taking fatalities to nearly 17,500. The Andean copper-producing country recorded 4,463 new cases for the day, taking its total to 366,550, double the number at the start of June. The numbers point to the struggles nations across the region have had in containing the pandemic, despite widely varying strategies to combat the outbreak.Mexico’s health ministry reported on Wednesday 6,019 new confirmed coronavirus infections and 790 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 362,274 cases and 41,190 deaths. The Mexican government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases.US US deaths from the novel coronavirus rose by more than 1,100 for a second day in a row on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally as leading US Senate Republicans and the White House said they had hammered out agreements in principle on portions of a potential coronavirus-response Bill. California reported a record 12,807 new confirmed cases, bringing the state’s total to 413,576. With the increase, the state surpassed New York as having the most cases. Florida reported 379,619 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, up 2.6 per cent from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 3.5 per cent in the previous seven days. Deaths among Florida residents reached 5,345, an increase of 139, or 2.7 per cent , according to the state department of health report, which includes data through Tuesday. Arizona’s virus cases continued to decline, with the state on Wednesday reporting 1,926 new infections, a 1.3 per cent increase to 150,609 and below the prior seven-day average of 2.2 per cent . The state department of health services reported 56 new deaths, bringing the toll to 2,974.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has forecasted that the US will reach 150,000 deaths by early August.IndiaIndia reported a record jump of 45,720 in coronavirus infections on Wednesday, taking its total number of cases to 1.24 million, the health ministry said. Almost a quarter of Delhi’s 28 million residents may have developed coronavirus antibodies, making it one of the worst-affected capital cities in the world, according to research. A random sample of 20,000 residents by India’s National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) found 23.4 per cent had antibodies to the virus. It appears that the majority were asymptomatic. The coronavirus crisis hit Delhi hard last month, pushing the city’s healthcare system to the brink of collapse, and many died after hospitals ran out of beds and ventilators. Yet the rate of exposure found in the NCDC study is far higher than the city’s officially reported 123,747 cases, suggesting the spread of coronavirus in India may be far greater than the official statistics show. India has the third highest number of cases in the world, and cases are rising there by more than 40,000 a day. The curve of infections is showing no sign of flattening and states across India, from Kerala to Kashmir, have reintroduced inidual lockdowns and night-time curfews in an effort to control the spread of the virusChina China reported 22 new coronavirus cases in the mainland for July 22nd, up from 14 cases a day earlier, the health commission said on Thursday. Of the new infections, 18 were in the far western region of Xinjiang and one was in Dalian city in the northeastern Liaoning province, according to a statement by the National Health Commission. The other three were imported cases. The Dalian case involved a 58-year-old man working at a seafood processing company. Multiple samples collected from the company, including frozen food, processing workshop, canteen and office building also tested positive, state media said. China reported 31 new asymptomatic patients, or those showing no symptoms, up from 22 a day earlier. China will provide a $1 billion loan for Latin American and Caribbean countries to have access to its Covid-19 vaccine, foreign minister Wang Yi told top regional diplomats, according to the Mexican government. In a virtual gathering, Mr Wang told his Latin American counterparts a vaccine developed by China would have universal access. He also presented a list of Chinese projects to fight the disease in the region, Mexico’s foreign affairs ministry said in a statement. Hong KongHong Kong reported 111 local virus cases on Thursday -- its second day of more than 100 local infections -- as the city scrambles to boost hospitalisation and testing capacity in the face of its worst outbreak ever. Two thirds of private demand for coronavirus tests from Hong Kong residents cannot be met as the city faces capacity bottlenecks, according to its largest private laboratory. Prenetics Ltd, along with other Hong Kong labs and hospitals, has beenoverloaded with people seeking virus tests since a new wave emerged 18 days ago, chief executive officer Danny Yeung said in an interview. Demand has swelled to as many as 20,000 a day from members of the public as the outbreak grows to over 700 local infections, he said.Europe Spanish tourism minister Reyes Maroto said a resurgence in coronavirus cases in Catalonia was coming under control and she hoped there would be no need for France to close the border.The Italian government will approve a new spending package, the third major cash injection since the start of the new coronavirus outbreak in the country, to try to prop up the economy.Ukraine will let spectators return for soccer matches up to a quarter of stadia capacity after a three-month pause.Russia reported 5,848 new Covid-19 infections in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 795,038, according to data from the government’s virus response center. There were 147 deaths, bringing total fatalities to 12,892, while 8,277 people recovered. Moscow reported 608 new infections, or 10.4 per cent of the daily total.British prime ministers Boris Johnson’s administration had no economic plan for a pandemic as coronavirus hit the UK in an “astonishing” failure of governance, a cross-party panel of lawmakers said. “Pandemic planning is the bread and butter of government risk planning, but we learn it was treated solely as a health issue, with no planning for the economic impacts,” the committee’s chairman said. “This meant that the economic strategy was of necessity rushed and reactive.” The government rejected that conclusion and said, with the crisis ongoing, this is not the right time to review its response.Africa and Middle EastTotal confirmed cases in Africa have passed 750,000, a Reuters tally of government and WHO data showed.South Africa reported a record 572 deaths from the coronavirus on Wednesday, almost tripling the previous daily high. The number of confirmed infections rose to 394,948 from 381,798 the day before, the department of health said in a statement. It gave no explanation for the surge in death numbers. So far 5,940 people have officially died from the virus in South Africa, according to the department.Israel’s parliament approved a Bill that allows the cabinet to declare a state of emergency and impose new restrictions with little to no parliamentary supervision. Lawmakers would have 24 hours to vet new regulations, which would automatically take effect in the case of no opposition. If the government deems the restrictions urgent, then they can take effect immediately. The Bill was passed amid a barrage of protests against the government’s handling of the crisis.Gazans are thronging beaches and crowding markets filled with holiday sweets and clothes as they prepare to celebrate Eid al-Adha largely free of restrictions.JapanAround 360 new coronavirus cases were found in Tokyo on Thursday, a record for a day, TV Asahi and other Japanese media reported, as a long holiday weekend began in Japan. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has told residents to avoid unnecessary trips outdoors as much as possible, after the city’s running total topped 10,000 and new cases nationwide hit a new daily record on Wednesday. Tokyo has over 3,800 cases so far this month, more than the previous peak in April when the city entered a state of emergency. Although Japan has suffered about 28,000 infections and more than 1,000 deaths, it has escaped the kind of explosive surge seen elsewhere. But recent signs of a spurt in infections in Japan, as well as other major economies, such as the United States, have prompted authorities to raise renewed alerts against the virus.IndonesiaIndonesia reported 1,906 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, bringing its total infections to 93,657, data from the country’s Covid-19 taskforce showed. The number of Covid-19 deaths in the Southeast Asian nation rose by 117 on Thursday to bring the total to 4,576, the data showed. –PA, Reuters, Bloomberg,  Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"King Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionRampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312065.1595526228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier says trade agreement unlikely between eu and uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson holding  crabs  at Stromness harbour during a visit to the Scottish Highlands and Northern Isles. Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet. Too many people died,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Former US vice-president and now candidate for the presideny Joe Biden. Photograph: Drew AngererGetty ImagesThe Soviet Union used to alternate between bald leaders and ones with formidable hair. The US, which is seldom ruled by the smooth of pate, swings around a different axis. It seems to crave a breather after each high-drama president.The Richard Nixon years gave on to some water-treading under Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. Ronald Reagan led to George HW Bush and the prelapsarian tranquillity of the 1990s. After the younger Bush and his still-simmering wars came Barack “No Drama” Obama. It follows that Donald Trump, the author of so much tumult, should prefigure a restful four years under Joe Biden. Moderate Republicans are counting on it. Not to impugn their principles, but they might be slower to say “Never Trump” if the alternative was as leftwing as Bernie Sanders or his Senate colleague Elizabeth Warren. Biden’s emergence as the Democratic candidate for the White House enabled their apostasy. What threat is there, after all, in a twice-elected vice-president, a voter for welfare reform, a clubbable bipartisan of the old Washington? What radical potential?More, perhaps, than in any Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson. Biden is running some way to the left of his old boss, Obama, or of Bill Clinton before him. On healthcare, but also on housing, education and climate change abatement, he is a late-life convert to expansive federal government. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, and the public debts it has incurred, he proposed to raise taxes on higher earners. It is true that any politician can draw up a bold manifesto. What gives this one its promise – or, for conservatives, its menace – are the circumstances of the day. Such is their polling surge that Democrats now contemplate (“expect” is overdoing it) victories in once-daunting Senate races. Even with control of that chamber, no programme is assured passage. But without it, a President Biden would be reliant on – don’t laugh – Republican co-operation. A Democratic majority gives him a chance.Taxes on the richNor would the Senate be the only handmaid to his agenda. At 77, Biden will need a strong vice-president. Of the touted candidates, most are to his left. Even the exception, former UN ambassador Susan Rice, is not moderate so much as hard to place on domestic issues.If these institutional variables align, they will still not constitute the ultimate tailwind for his programme. That is public sentiment itself. The image of America as a land of masochistic self-reliance belies its taste for universal public services, healthcare reform and taxes on the rich. If Biden has changed, he has done so in step with his compatriots. As a proxy measure, consider that voters still place him much nearer the middle ground than Trump, even as they register that he has shuffled left.Biden as change-maker: it is still a jarring picture, somehow. But that makes it all the more likely to materialise.Of the three Democrat presidents who did most to build, entrench and expand the welfare state, none had seemed destined for anything of the kind. Franklin class-treachery. Harry Truman was a Roosevelt was a blue blood whose New Deal remains America’s noblest act of machine politician from the pragmatic Midwest. As for Johnson, progressives feared they were getting an unreconstructed vulgarian, not the Civil Rights Act and Medicare. It was not despite their outward pragmatism and their lack of leftist credentials that these men achieved reform. It was because of them. They were impossible to paint as extremists. This trick is not unique to US politics. Britain’s postwar prime minister Clement Attlee was such a parody of English diffidence that, when asked if he was an agnostic, he supposedly said: “I don’t know.” After six years in office, he had nationalised healthcare and major industries. No firebrand could have done it.Does Biden have a trace of these leaders’ skill? That he is on his third bid for the White House suggests not. What he does have is their seeming innocuousness. Bold policies can be smuggled under its cover. In that sense, Trump’s jibe at him – “Sleepy Joe” – is not just failing to land. It is misconceived in the first place.The more he is seen as a do-nothing grandpa, the more license Biden has to advance ideas that would have done for another candidate.

My father was violent to my mother growing up. They loved each other, but he was very violent to her until the end. My dad struggled with alcohol issues his his whole life, an addict and alcoholic, very violent but I loved him very much.”She texted her mother in March 2013 - early in their relationship - to say: “He makes dad looks like a saint when he falls off the wagon”, later saying: “I can\u0027t tell dad.”The text exchange came a few hours after Mr Depp had allegedly tried to set a painting on fire with his lighter while high on cocaine and whisky after accusing Ms Heard of having an affair with its painter, her former partner Tasya Van Ree.She added that she didn\u0027t tell her mother the truth about the violence at that time because she just didn\u0027t want her to tell my dad.  The actor allegedly “shoved” Ms Heard into a wall and hit her in the face when she tried to stop him setting the painting on fire, drawing blood with his rings which sprayed onto a nearby wall.In one text Ms Heard wrote: My heart is broken. I\u0027m ok physically. JD didn\u0027t hit me or anything last night. I told him that would be if he did and it worked last night. But I\u0027m scared by what I see and who I see now. It\u0027s Dr Jekyll and mr Hyde -- on a binge.She later texted: It\u0027s OK mom. He\u0027s not being violent with me. He\u0027s just even raging in general. And the crazy mood swings and binges are really difficult for me to handle, adding moments later: He\u0027s nuts mom. Violent and crazy. I am heartbroken that THIS is who I love.In another text to her mother read to the court, Ms Heard said: He told his friends yesterday that he was really lost, but of course when I try to suggest that is part of the fighting, he claims he is not affected whatsoever by it.He has been at my house for weeks now. Last night I locked the deadbolt.Asked by Sasha Wass QC what she was referring to by locking the deadbolt Ms Heard replied: I couldn\u0027t get a moment\u0027s sleep... I was either defending myself or trying to make him happy, calm him down, whatever.Johnny Depp tried to set a painting on fire with his lighter while high on cocaine and whisky after accusing his wife Amber Heard of having an affair with its painter, her former partner Tasya Van Ree, a court has been told.The actor allegedly “shoved” Ms Heard into a wall and hit her in the face when she tried to stop him, drawing blood with his rings which sprayed onto a nearby wall.The Aquaman actress was completing her evidence in Mr Depp\u0027s High Court libel case against The Sun over allegations of domestic violence.Ms Heard claims that Mr Depp refused to leave the couple’s house to meet his idol, the Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, on the set of a documentary in order to carry on the argument, saying: “He wanted me to admit that I was having an affair with Tasya.”She told the court: “At one point he tried to set the painting on fire with his lighter. He hit me in the face with the back of his hand and drew blood, some of which ended up on the wall. At various points he grabbed me hard, shook me, and shove me into a wall. I couldn’t calm him down - he was so angry and just wouldn’t let it go.”Ms Heard, 34, has accused Mr Depp, 57, of verbal and physical abuse throughout their relationship - allegedly punching, slapping, kicking, headbutting and choking her, as well as displaying extremely controlling and intimidating behaviour.Mr Depp, however, says he was not violent towards Ms Heard, claiming it was she who was violent to him.During her evidence, which began on Monday, Ms Heard has claimed Mr Depp pushed Kate Moss down a flight of stairs, blamed faeces found in the couple\u0027s bed after her 30th birthday on one of their pet dogs and denied having an affair with Tesla founder Elon Musk.On Wednesday Hollywood make up artist Melanie Inglessis said Ms Heard told her Mr Depp had tried to suffocate her with a pillow, dragged her by her hair and tried to kill her at the couple\u0027s LA penthouse in December 2015.The actress has described the alleged incident as one of the worst and most violent nights of our relationship.Ms Heard alleges that Mr Depp slapped her, dragged her by the hair through their apartment, pulling clumps of her hair out, and then repeatedly punched her in the head, which he denies.Ms Inglessis told the High Court that she had to apply concealer and lipstick to Ms Heard’s face to cover the bruising so she could go on James Corden’s prime time talk show.Giving evidence via video link from LA, Ms Inglessis said: She said \u0027Johnny and I had a fight\u0027, she said he tried to suffocate her with a pillow, she felt he tried to kill her that night and dragged her by her hair.Describing Ms Heard\u0027s appearance the day after the alleged attack Ms Inglessis told the High Court: She had minimal discolouration by her nose, her left eye a little more bruised than her right eye, the bridge of her nose swollen and I remember a scab to the right of her lip.Ms Heard will conclude her evidence about 14 allegations of domestic violence, which The Sun\u0027s publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) relies on in its defence of an April 2018 article that called Mr Depp a wife beater, at the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Thursday.Her sister Whitney Henriquez, who previously lived in one of five penthouses owned by Mr Depp in the Eastern Columbia Building in Los Angeles, is due to give evidence on Thursday afternoon.Ms Heard denied telling lies about her claims Mr Depp was violent after the actor\u0027s barrister Eleanor Laws QC accused her of instigating the assaults and rows and concocting the allegations against her ex-husband in response to other witnesses\u0027 evidence.Ms Heard told the High Court the star threw bottles like grenades during an explosive row in Australia in which the Pirates Of The Caribbean star lost the top of his middle finger in disputed circumstances.Ms Heard told the court: He started picking them up one by one and throwing them like grenades.One after the other after the other, in my direction, and I felt glass breaking behind me, I retreated more into the bar and he didn\u0027t stop.I was too scared to look behind me. He threw all the bottles that were in reach, all except for one which was a celebratory magnum-sized bottle of wine.Mr Depp is suing NGN and The Sun\u0027s executive editor Dan Wootton over the publication of an article on April 27 2018, with the headline: Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be \u0027genuinely happy\u0027 casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?His lawyers say the article bore the meaning there was overwhelming evidence Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard on a number of occasions and left her in fear for her life.NGN is defending the article as true, and says Mr Depp was controlling and verbally and physically abusive towards Ms Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol andor drugs.The case, the biggest English libel trial of the 21st century, is due to finish next week with closing submissions from both sides\u0027 legal teams on Monday and Tuesday.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"did party business end forgetting economy","story":"It feels like a different millennium in which Theresa May reiterated Strong and Stable like a short-circuited automaton, prompting a tidal wave of memes and groans.

Having realised this, much behind the scenes flailing needed to take place before the nation\u0027s economic handbrake could be yanked up, costing the country valuable time in managing the spread of infection.The curve is now flattened and society is slowly blinking into the summer sun following a trimester of captivity to survey a barren economic landscape. The consequences of a rushed and reactive lockdown on whole sectors of the economy suggest that the fabled V shaped recovery will remain hidden for some time under another squashed sombrero of productivity. The problem is not the government’s economic strategy, but the utter lack of one. The government was reportedly forced to design economic schemes from scratch, with the ramifications barely explored. As a result, we were hamstrung as to when we could hit the go button on the very pandemic strategy for which we had received international acclaim.In neglecting the economy, the party of fiscal prudence dropped the ball it claims to put in the back of the net at every election. The irony is that the Conservatives are entirely right - a country needs strong leadership and a stable economy to weather a storm.

The Prime Minister is set to announce the next stage of the project, namely the financing of a viability study, and loyal ministers are enthusiastically talking up the benefits.On paper is still where the bridge is most likely to stay for the foreseeable future. Even in the post-Covid era, when fiscal prudence has gone out of fashion, the £20 billion price tag looks as forbidding as the task of raising gargantuan structures in the Irish Sea in winter. It’s also probably a severe underestimate. The 30-metre Garden Bridge across the Thames, now abandoned, was costed at an optimistic £200 million. A bridge across the Irish Sea would need to stretch for 28 very expensive miles.But that’s no reason not to explore the possibility. The prophets of doom were equally gloomy about the Channel Tunnel, and they were wrong. Eventually.If nothing else, the ease of access afforded by a bridge might make Northern Ireland feel less distant to people in England, Scotland and Wales, as well as standing as both a symbolic and physical representation of the links that still exist between the four home nations at a time when fractious disunity seems to have become the new normal in relations.As Irish nationalists, radicalised by Brexit, become increasingly strident in their demands for a border poll to reunite Ireland under the European Union flag, it could also help reassure those attached to the older Union that they’re not being left behind in whatever new Britain ends up being built after the transition period ends on December 31. After pulling the rug from under Unionists’ feet by agreeing to a customs border in the Irish Sea, that’s the least the Prime Minister owes them.If the bridge brought economic benefits to a region too often bypassed by booms and still overly reliant on the block grant from Westminster, all the better. The UK mainland is already used by Irish exporters as a land bridge to Europe. Joining up Great Britain to the island next door has the potential to transform Northern Ireland into a land bridge to the land bridge, increasing valuable traffic north and south as well as east and west.There is a risk, however. It’s not hard to imagine ways in which the Boris bridge could loosen, rather than strengthen, the bonds of the Union.The wider British population are not the only ones who look on Northern Ireland as semi-detached and alien. People in the Irish Republic do so as well. Most have never even visited the northern part of what they purport to regard as the national territory. Lip service is paid to the dream of Irish unity, but the allegiance is sentimental rather than practical.The sudden convenience of a bridge could change that, sending more travellers north, if only en route to other places, stitching Northern Ireland more fully into the consciousness of people in the Republic. The bridge may well make them think of the North as a more normal member of the family, rather than a dysfunctional and disruptive distant relative.Should Scotland continue down the path to independence under the impatient tutelage of the SNP, it’s also easy to picture a scenario in which the bridge heralds a different sort of union. Not one of all the British Isles, as envisaged by Boris Johnson and previous generations of statesmen, but one that brings closer the restless Celtic fringes in a new power base, united by what feels at times like a pathological enmity towards England.Edinburgh and Dublin have already started tentatively scouting out joint interests post-Brexit. Comparisons have been made with the Nordic Council, which brings together Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and others, or the similar Baltic Assembly. A bridge could become another way to avoid England entirely, as pro-EU Gaels flex their muscles.A resurgence of pan-Celticism seems as improbable now as that bridge itself, but unionists across the UK should be careful what they wish for. Devolution had unforeseen consequences. A bridge would too.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"luton blackburn darwen now areas intervention coronavirus infection","story":"Luton and Blackburn with Darwen have been classified as areas of intervention on a Government watch list amid concern about rising numbers of Covid-19 cases.Both areas could see local lockdowns or targeted measures such as the closures of workplaces, pubs, or shops under the regime if cases continue to rise. The latest surveillance puts their alert status on a par with Leicester, which remains in partial lockdown after a surge in cases last month.Data shows the rate in Blackburn with Darwen is the highest in the country, with 81.9 cases per 100,000 in the seven days ending July 20, up from 49.7 cases a week earlier, Public Health England data showed.It has overtaken Leicester, where the rate went down from 102.5 to 65.6 over the same period.

It will offer passengers a way to make the mile-long journey from one side of the Las Vegas Convention Center to the other in under two minutes.Mr Musk tweeted a picture of the rendered transportation hub, with the caption, Coming soon.Elon Musk claims his chip will allow you to stream music to your brainIt included several Tesla Model 3\u0027s parked in bays, together with an information board displaying the time and order each electric vehicle will leave.A poster on the wall of the station riffs off the popular Las Vegas maxim, stating: What happens here, only happens here.More details about the Las Vegas Loop were published in May by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, revealing that three stations are being built to help move thousands of convention attendees around its 200-acre campus.The $52.5 million (£41m) project is being completed at a rate of 100ft per day, and once completed will have the capacity to transport up to 4,400 passengers per hour.When it first opens the Convention Center Loop will use a variety of Tesla vehicles staffed with drivers, though eventually it hopes to use completely autonomous shuttles.The system has the potential for future expansion and connectivity to resorts on the Strip, Downtown Las Vegas, McCarran International Airport, and beyond, the Las Vegas authority wrote.The Boring Company claims the tunnel system can transform the way people travel around cities around the world, and has already made preliminary deals with several US cities.A large network of tunnels many levels deep would help alleviate congestion in any city, no matter how large it grew (just keep adding levels), the company\u0027s website states.The key to making this work is increasing tunnelling speed and dropping costs by a factor of 10 or more - this is the goal of The Boring Company.The first mile-long prototype tunnel under LA was dug at a cost of $10 million, according to Mr Musk, which he claimed was a significant improvement on the cost of current boring technologies.Another potential advantage of the excavation process is that earth removed by the tunnel-digging machines can be used to make bricks for building structures.In typical tunnelling projects, excavated dirt is shipped offsite to disposal locations, the firm states on its website. This process is costly, time-consuming, noisy, and can be environmentally hazardous.

Instead, they use mirrors and prisms to reflect the light around the device, making use of space within the phone but not adding bulk to the phone.Demonstrations of such technology have shown how it is able to produce impressive amounts of zoom, without any degradation of quality.Apple introduced a zoom lens with its iPhone 7 Plus, when it added a two times zoom lens. It has kept that lens around in many phones since.Other companies have added extra capabilities, with Huawei\u0027s 10 times zoom remaining the most dramatic of Apple\u0027s competitors. But Apple has not added any further capabilities to any of its handsets.Instead, it has moved the other way, and its latest phones offer 0.5 times zoom capabilities, which are intended to allow people to zoom out and get detail into pictures that would usually otherwise be cropped out. The latest iPhone 11 Pro includes three lenses – one for zoom and one for extra width – but the cheaper iPhone 11 does not contain any zoom lens at all.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anyone who has this or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand,” adding: “I feel like I should comment on it because of the stigma and misconceptions about mental health.”She called her husband “a brilliant but complicated person” whose “words sometimes do not align with his intentions”.“Living with bipolar disorder does not diminish or invalidate his dreams or creative ideas,” she wrote, asking for “compassion and empathy” on behalf of her family.Her statement came after West shared a series of troubling, now-deleted tweets about his personal life.Those tweets were posted after West held a political rally in South Carolina on Sunday.Back on 4 July, West said he was running for president in 2020.

Well, Jennifer Lawrence was interested. Jen, don’t worry, Taylor and I are still really good friends.”However, Swift was not in attendance at either of Kloss’s wedding ceremonies to businessman Joshua Kushner in 2019. Kloss has also been photographed with Scooter Braun, who Swift has repeatedly condemned over the purchasing of her master recordings.On Twitter, Swift fans have speculated that the new album may feature lyrics that clarify if they’re still friendly.They’ve also theorised that “Betty”, a track on Folklore, could be a secret reference to Kloss, whose middle name is Elizabeth.Earlier today (23 July), Swift announced that she had written and recorded an entire album in lockdown that she was dropping without any pre-publicity. It includes collaborations with Jack Antonoff, Bon Iver and Aaron Dessner of The National.“Before this year I probably would’ve overthought when to release this music at the ‘perfect’ time, but the times we’re living in keep reminding me that nothing is guaranteed,” Swift said in a statement. “My gut is telling me that if you make something you love, you should just put it out into the world.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is not some kind of competition – this is our nation’s lives and livelihoods at stake.”The report called for more transparency in the government’s decision-making, stating that it has been slow “on important issues”, such as the NHS Test and Trace programme. It also criticised the “stop-start” approach to school closures, stating the risk of “major harm to many children’s life chances, exacerbating already-existing inequalities”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But despite a pandemic being identified as the government’s top non-malicious risk, it failed to stock up in advance.“The Department of Health and Social Care was not focused enough on the challenge of how to identify need in the care sector and ensure supply of PPE,” it said.No help for millions excluded from Covid-19 support, says chancellorIt was recommended that the Cabinet Office reviews its “crisis command structures” to ensure any future or long-term decisions are “properly informed and coordinated effectively” throughout the government.The committee also called for greater involvement with businesses regarding their needs and said the Treasury should engage with key sectors and industries to “develop bespoke support measures aimed at helping those businesses through the ongoing effects of the pandemic”.It added: “Central government has not given local authorities the clarity or support they need over longer-term funding.”A government spokesperson said in response to the PAC report: “As the public would expect, we regularly test our pandemic plans – allowing us to rapidly respond to this unprecedented crisis and protect the NHS.“It was clear that Coronavirus would affect all areas of the country, that’s why we immediately put in place an unprecedented initial economic support package for jobs and business worth £160 billion. The next stage in our economic response will make a further £30 billion available to ensure all areas of the UK bounce back.“We’re providing over £100 million to support children to learn at home and a £1 billion Covid catch up fund will directly tackle the impact of lost teaching time, as schools and colleges welcome children back in September. In addition, we’ve committed almost £28 billion to local areas to support councils, businesses and communities.“Over £3 billion of additional winter funding will be available immediately to the NHS to prepare for the risk of a second peak and we continue to work around the clock to ensure PPE is delivered as quickly as possible to those on the frontline.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) initially said they were of limited use in tackling the virus.But the health body updated its official guidance in June, citing growing evidence suggesting that face coverings can help slow the spread of the disease when worn in enclosed spaces.Hundreds of new coronavirus test centres to open across EnglandSome, however, say the evidence is flimsy, arguing that the presence of face masks in public is deterring people form returning to “normal life” and therefore holding back the UK’s economic recovery.In the UK, tensions in government came to a head on 12 July when Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that face masks should not be mandatory in shops, appearing to contradict indications made by his boss, Boris Johnson, the previous week.Mr Hancock made his announcement the following day, meaning England will now join Germany, Spain and Italy in making face masks compulsory inside shops.The announcement came a little over a week after Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish first minister, made face coverings mandatory in shops, leading some commentators to accuse the PM of caving to pressure to change public advice.Below is a timeline of some of the major twists and turns and changing advice in the face mask debate.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Vladimir Putin has awarded the rank of major general to Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov – a man who has been linked to the killing, torture and disappearance of hundreds.   Mr Kadyrov, who published the new honour on his social media pages on Thursday, said the Russian president had called him personally to read out the executive order.“It is a high distinction that I value highly,” he wrote. “I’m the president’s loyal solider, and ready to carry out any order on any continent he wishes.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe move comes less than three days after the US State Department announced the blacklisting the controversial strongman and his family. On Monday, secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the sanctions were the result of “numerous gross violations of human rights dating back more than a decade”.Thursday’s development appeared to be a direct response to the US snub, and was trailed two days ago when foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova first responded to the US move. “It will be difficult to respond reciprocally, but we will think up something,” she said.  Mr Kadyrov’s own response fell much in line with his brand. In a message on Telegram – his Instagram, and Facebook accounts have been suspended – he posted a picture of himself brandishing two guns. “Pompeo, we accept the fight!” the caption read. “What comes next will be more interesting.” Since assuming power from his assassinated father in 2004, the tiger-loving strongman has ruled Chechnya as a personal fiefdom. He enjoys autonomy unrivalled among any other regional leader – the result of a grand security bargain to keep order following two bloody wars with Moscow. Chechen leader denies gay massacre saying ‘such people do not exist’The strongman has used the deal to deliver personal riches and a regime of terror, with critics frequently disappearing in mysterious circumstances. Mr Kadyrov is understood to have supported several waves of repressions of LGBT+ people beginning in 2017. At least three men have died, with dozens missing, and hundreds more reporting torture. Russian authorities have refused to investigate the evidence, or open a criminal case. Igor Kochetkov, whose Russian LGBT Network led the frontline emergency effort to evacuate at-risk citizens, said the honour underlined the Kremlin’s attitude to human rights abuse. “The authorities are showing they don’t want to investigate Kadyrov’s crimes,” Mr Kochetkov told The Independent. “The award of military titles and honours tells him everything he needs to know.”  No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shocking new statistics show people with epilepsy are the worst affected disability group in education and employment - more than those with severe disfigurements and heart problems. Figures from the Office for National Statisticsshow that Brits are more likely to have a degree than to have no qualications at all – but those with epilepsy are the least likely to have a degree and the most likely to have no qualications out of all disability types.But although more than half of Brits with the condition dont have seizures , over a quarter have no qualications and the majority remain unemployed. Louise Cousins, a spokesperson for Epilepsy Action, says children with epilepsy are likely to miss a lot of time in the classroom because of seizures, recovery time, and medical appointments. It’s shocking that so many people with epilepsy struggle to gain qualications, she tells Sun Online. Sadly, though, it is not surprising. Our current education system does not meet the needs of many children with epilepsy. This has a knock-on impact on their lives and future prospects.Seizures and anti-epileptic drugs can make kids extremely tired and create problems with concentration and memory – though these dficulties often go unrecognised and unsupported in school.Hannah, now , from Swansea, said at school she was made to feel lazy, stupid, and clumsy because of her epilepsy. She believes the low qualication rate for people with the condition is due to the students lack of confidence. Hannah experienced her first seizure when she was just six years old.What I remember most about school is being told off because I couldn’t remember what we were doing in a particular subject after a bad night of seizures, Hannah says. Your memory just doesnt stick.You lose confidence. You want to do well but then you get knocked down.Hannah skipped classes as she felt unsupported.I learnt how to play truant, she says. Especially when I got older.Hannah left school with no qualications at the age of , claiming her GCSEs had been an absolute failure.Hannah now stresses how important it is that children with epilepsy get the support they need in school. When you’re that young and not getting the support, it affects friendships and what the teachers might think of you, she says. Ana Patterson, , from Twickenham, thinks that the low qualication rate among people with epilepsy could be because kids with epilepsy in school can feel like an outsider.Ana was diagnosed at -years-old with photosensitive epilepsy and experiences tonic-clonic seizures – the typical movie kind of seizure where you go unconscious and start shaking, she says. I dont think staff or teachers really know how to deal with epilepsy. I dont blame them too much because epilepsy is a disorder that is so dferent in each inidual so I think some of that problem comes from the lack of communication between the hospital and school.But I often felt like a liability and that people werent always sure what to do.Ana says her school were often too quick to call the ambulance when they didnt need to as in her case of epilepsy, an ambulance only needs to be calledthe seizure lasts for five minutes or longer or she hurts herself.I felt aseveryone was tiptoeing around me, and this lack of understanding made me feel like an outsider, Ana says.I think we need to recognise epilepsy in education and schools as these children need to grow up and feel accepted.They need to feel like there are people looking out for them but that they can be just as normal as the next people, their classmate, who is neurotypical and fine.But the education system is not the only area where people with epilepsy face particular challenges.The same disparities are sadly mirrored in the workplace where  per cent of working age adults in the UK with epilepsy are out of work – compared to the national unemployment figure of  per cent.Philip Lee, chief executive at Epilepsy Action, says that epilepsy is still a stigmatised condition in the workplace.These figures are very worrying, yet they only skim the surface, he adds.From the initial application and job interview process to the day-to-day experience of working, many people with epilepsy encounter clear barriers and discrimination. Hannah re-sat her GCSEs in her twenties and went on to study for a degree in volcanology with the Open University.But she remains out of work and still feels discriminated against because of her condition.I feel like Im on the scrapheap, she said. Even though I know I can contribute to this society.As soon as I say that I have epilepsy, which is reasonably controlled because I have a VNS implant , employers will just say, Oh, well thank you but we’re not interested, and that’s it. Its a neurological condition where sudden bursts of electrical activity in the brain cause symptoms including seizures, unusual behaviour, and sometimes loss of awareness. Epilepsy can sometimes run in families or begin after head injuries, but its precise causes arent always clear.Medication can be taken to manage seizures, but its often a lelong condition. Most children with epilepsy can go to mainstream schools, take part in sports, and get a job when theyre older. But certain activities like swimming, driving or certain jobs may be more dangerous for people with epilepsy.Or they will say, Yes we can try you for three months, and then after three months they will come up with an excuse and say, Oh actually, we’re closing down or, We don’t need you anymore.Two weeks later you will see the same job you’ve just been doing for the last three months advertised again. You just lose hope in the end.Sophie Wild, who is currently studying politics and human rights at Leeds Beckett University, always felt supported in education.Yet the -year-old, from Lancashire, has already felt discrimination in the workplace due to her condition.Sophie worked in a chain fashion shop part-time while studying, but ran into problems when she changed stores.My new manager gave me loads of grief about my absences from when I was at the other store and he said that I was going to get investigated for having too many absences, Sophie says. One time I rang in sick and he was on the phone to me for  minutes giving me grief about my absences from when I didn’t even work there and from when I was in hospital and had a two-week sick note. He just wasn’t listening to me and I was trying to explain to him that I have days where I can’t get out of bed and he was just being really dismissive of it.I was upset, I was crying on the phone and he was still going on at me so I just thought I’d rather quit my job than make myself ill.Sophie said that because epilepsy is an invisible disability, she doesnt feel that she faces day-to-day discrimination.But she admits she feels nervous telling people she has the condition, particularly employers.I think it makes people nervous –I tell someone they’re always really shocked.I feel likeI applied for a job and they knew that I have epilepsy they might not want the burden of someone having a seizure in the workplace or being off. I feel like it makes people scared.Schools are required by law to make reasonable adjustments to help children with epilepsy.These could include allowing extra time, repeating things already taught, regularly checking that pupils have understood lessons, and allowing extra time in exams.With the right support from medical professionals and school, children with epilepsy can flourish in education and reach their full potential, a spokesperson from Epilepsy Action told Sun Online.Under the Equality Act, people with epilepsy are legally protected from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society.Lee calls on employers to take simple steps to help support people with epilepsy.Increased knowledge and a change in attitudes are the only ways we can start to close this inequality gap. Employers should encourage transparency from the outset and make it their business to learn more about epilepsy. It’s only then that they can improve workplace culture and create a level, more inclusive, playing field to help people with epilepsy pursue the career they want.”A government spokesperson said: The safety, wellbeing and outcomes of children with complex needs - including those with epilepsy - is a priority for this Government. Schools must follow our statutory advice on supporting pupils with medical conditions so that they have full access to education, and can enjoy the same opportunities at school as any other child.Throughout the pandemic we have supported families of children with SEND, kept schools open for children with education, health and care plans where appropriate, and signposted to high quality online learning resources.We now spend a record £billion a year to support people with disabilities and later this year well launch a national strategy to set out how we can better support them to have equal access to all spheres of le.Epilepsy support and resources can be found at epilepsy.org.ukOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Quick-witted, smart, self-deprecating, incredibly likeable and a bit odd-looking. A man who gives hope to fans, both through his career and marriage to Abbey Clancy.Then a double calamity struck. Euro  was cancelled and instead of ­canning the project the BBC pressed on with SOS, shackling it with a hostage-to-fortune title and all sorts of baggage and “other stuff” the show could have done ­without as well.Aside from a garden centre set and enormous table, around which Churchill could’ve signed the Yalta agreement, the baggage came in human form: Crouchy’s former team-mates, The Horne Section studio band, a guest comedian and, of course, Maya, who provided my series highlight when she got dangerously side-tracked by the host’s leisure and tourism qualication.“I don’t want to sound silly or anything,” said Maya, carefully setting her own trap, “But what is a GVNQ ”“It’s a GNVQ.” Obviously.As awkwardly as hosts and guests have all gelled, though, the thing that’s really torpedoed this show has been the other stuff. Those outside broadcasts and studio features that were meant to fill the ­football gap, but didn’t.Two regulars were a chino-clad irritant called Fast Dad, who competed against the host to win football memorabilia for a viewer and “Peter’s Extreme Retirement”, which included all the ideas Alan ­Partridge would’ve thought a bit naff, like water-skiing with Joe Cole.The game not even Crouchy’s GNVQ could help him understand, though, was a VAR-related pun called Very Accurate Rhythm.On Saturday it involved Mo Gilligan playing keepie-uppie to The Horne ­Section’s version of Hit Me Baby One More Time. In previous weeks, however, it was Tinie Tempah and Katherine Ryan having a go at swingball and Jimmy Carr playing Mel C at table tennis.There’s a scoreboard as well, yet no sense of what the hell’s going on here, other than the fact that not a single ­person at the BBC knows how to produce light entertainment.If they did, one of them would have given Peter Crouch the two words of prime-time advice he desperately needed to hear. Don’t. Swear.They didn’t, though. Crouchy and his mates swore like he was presenting a late-night E show and so ended up with an E-sized audience of about one ­million. That’s the reason you never see masters of the light entertainment art, Ant  Dec, dropping the F-bomb.In its youth-driven madness, the BBC might think this is a good thing but it alienates the people who actually pay their wages and has direct consequences for Crouch who, before this started, I thought, could have become a ­Saturday night staple. Now  Mystery guest round on A Question Of Sport, tops. That’s how he’s been coping without the football, Maya.And ex-Celtic manager John Barnes enlivening ITV’s Stephen Lawrence: Has Britain Changed  debate by telling the audience it needed to “elevate people like me and people like Barack Obama”, asthe former US President had ever worked with anyone of the magnitude of Jackie McNamara and Regi Blinker.You’re far too modest, John.Celebrity Snoop Dogs, Kevin McCloud: “It’s the much-loved Martine McCutcheon.” The One Show, Amol Rajan: “Today’s first guest is a man of many talents, Nick Knowles.”Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer, Maya Jama to the host: “God loves a trier.”Loves  He’s sent down a plague of locusts for less than SOS.ANYONE who watched last night’s episode of the landmark BBC series Once Upon A Time In Iraq is unlikely to forget it in a hurry.The story of the  invasion is grimly familiar, but what sets this show apart are the testimonies from its eyewitnesses.None of them wastes words. All of them are mesmerising.Two, though, still managed to stand out from the others.The first was a darkly funny Iraqi called Waleed Nesy who, before he became a journalist’s translator, was pro-war and fronted Baghdad’s only state-approved heavy metal band which, I’m desperately hoping, were called Black Sabba’ath.The other was ferociously bright US army officer Lieutenant-Colonel Nate Sassaman, “a charismatic leader of men” who was hoping to bring peace, democracy and lots of other empty promises to the country until he entered his first local medical centre and: “I’m telling you, the woman running it  She was as hard as a woodpecker’s lips.”Both were damaged by the catastrophe that unfolded and, in the case of Sassaman, helped cause, but they somehow retained their humanity, honesty and sense of humour, which made their testimony all the more astonishing.Like all great war documentaries, Once Upon A Time In Iraq was also prepared to let silence tell the story when the brutality or stupidity became too overwhelming.They made an exception for Waleed, though, when, six weeks into the invasion, President George W Bush boldly declared: “Mission accomplished.”“Mission accomplished  Oh yeah  . . . SERIOUSLY ”Three more episodes will tell you very graphically how well that worked out and they’re as good as anything you’ve watched all year.INCIDENTALLY, I’m grateful to This Morning hosts Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes for revealing blind Celebrity MasterChef contestant Amar Lat measured liquids with “talking jugs”.Which, by a million-to-one coincidence, was also ITV’s original working title for Loose Women.My Strange Addiction: “Eating mattresses can lead to liver damage, intestinal blockage and even death.”But on the plus side, it won’t leave you bed-ridden.Emile Heskey: “When your back’s against the wall, it’s easy to lie down.”Jeff Stelling: “This game will be over when the referee blows the final whistle.”And Chris Kamara: “Three points is another point on the board.”BY the way,you haven’t ever seen Chernobyl, one of the greatest TV dramas ever made, Friday, pm, Sky Atlantic, is your chance.No further excuses will be accepted.WITH no little air of self-congratulation, last week, Celebrity MasterChef welcomed its first ever blind contestant, “travel presenter” Amar Lat, who arrived with a helper and his own super power.“I’ve started to hear the food talking to me,” he explained. “It’s almost like it’s communicating to me and it’s saying . . .”“Don’t worry, Amar. The BBC won’t chuck you out first. It’d look bad.”As good fortune would have it, he didn’t need to worry too much as it was the worst line-up of the series and included Gethin Jones, playing to the camera, rapper Lady Leshurr, whose speciality seemed to be “in-flight meals” and Alan Partridge star Felicity “Lynn Benfield” Montagu, who served up a salad for the guest judges that looked like a Haitian voodoo rattle.The real fall guy, though, appeared to be Jeff Brazier who, at the first challenge, was tugging away at a string of garlic for a good ten seconds before he twigged. “Ah. It’s a decoration. It’s made of polystyrene.”Those people who cry at absolutely everything, of course, were quick to let everyone  know Amar’s eventual progression to the semi-final made them “cry”.I thought the highlight of the week, however, came at the end of the pair’s dessert challenge when the judges’ comments led Amar to ask: “Are you two fat ” and Gregg Wallace replied: “Are you familiar with Jean-Claude Van Damme ”“Yes.”Then get someone to talk you through his voiceover on Minions: The Rise Of Gru.The resemblance is uncanny.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We knew it cracked down on all domestic opposition. We knew of the way in which they were undercutting the economies of the West.But not until the spread of the Wuhan virus did so many people come to realise how untrustworthy the Chinese leadership is.Now, every day brings more bad news about China. It isn’t because China is doing any-thing new. It is because China has caught the world’s attention.Not in a good way.Just consider the events of recent days.The Chinese government’s mistreatment of its Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang has been known about for years.The Muslim minority group, who regard themselves as closer to Central Asian countries — their language is related to Turkish — have long been in the government’s sights.Armed guardsFor years the Chinese Communist Party has had Xinjiang under its version of special measures.Claiming the one-time independent state, which borders eight countries, constitutes a special security risk, the communists have had the people there under mass surveillance.Even before the recent mass imprisonment, they have had them subjected to forced labour.In recent years they have subjected the entire population to compulsory birth control to try to reduce the size of the population.But for years the world’s attention was not focused on this.We all had troubles of our own to look to.So the Chinese authorities got away with putting perhaps as many as one million Uighur people in what are basically concentration camps — places where these people are meant to be “re-educated” and otherwise “corrected”.Now, drone footage has surfaced which shows shackled, blindfolded prisoners in the province being marched on to trains by rows of armed guards.The scenes are awful.As our Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, rightly said at the weekend, they are “reminiscent of something we have not seen for a very long time”.He is right.Yet when the Chinese Ambassador to our country was asked about this at the weekend, he pretended to have no idea what the footage was.He even tried to ert attention by asking his inter- viewer whether he had ever himself been to the charming province in question.But we are not as easily distracted by China as we used to be. Every day brings fresh causes.First, we had China’s appalling behaviour in Hong Kong, breaking its agreements with the UK and cracking down on the local population.Then last week came our Government’s decision to remove Chinese firm Huawei from any involvement in Britain’s G network.Huawei is basically a Chinese government agency and it would have been a serious security breach to allow it to control all our internet communications. Or to develop a back door for looking into them.Then a number of senior Conservatives warned that social media app TikTok is “as much of a threat” to Britain as Huawei.That may sound funny to parents whose children are addicted to it.For most of us, the app is just a source of amusement or bemusement.Depending on your age.But whatever your reaction to it, a growing number of people believe Chinese tech-nologies like TikTok are not safe. Because TikTok’s parent company is ByteDance, a Chinese firm founded in .Of course, the company claims to be independent, as all such firms do, but in China major firms are not independent as they are in Britain or other free societies.Critics insist TikTok could easily be used by hostile forces to harvest information from, and otherwise target, all those who use it.Of course, all of this has brought a degree of sabre-rattling from Beijing.China’s leaders have got used to telling everyone  what to do.As they spread their financial wings in recent decades, countries like ours were very keen to enjoy the benefits.Universities in the UK repeatedly took money from China. Money with strings attached.But money that some of our greedier universities thought was free. Only later learning otherwise.Naturally, the turnaround of recent months has been badly received in Beijing.Its ambassadors and state media have spent recent days pretending it is Britain that is the untrustworthy partner.They are wrong.We are not inconsistent or unfair. We are simply a country that has begun to wake up to a threat.Like the rest of the world. And not a moment too soon.Jaguar Land Rover builds cars for them under a joint venture with Chery Automobile. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has , employees in China across several manufacturing sites, as well as an innovation centre and a ­campus.So as tensions ramp up after the decision to remove Huawei from the UK’s G network, Britain should remember it, too, has aces to play. Most notably tech and skills.To learn about these is why so many Chinese students come to our universities. It is the same reason why state-owned China General Nuclear Power is a one-third partner in the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.It will have a front-row seat to the latest tech as China prepares to build around  reactors of its own.Saying no to Chinese firms is not to be taken lightly.There are around , Chinese companies that do business in the UK. The largest  employ , people.But let’s not forget they need us too.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He seems fine.” Seriously Let’s hope this was just an attempt at media distraction and that, behind the scenes, he and other influential friends are telling Kanye the truth he so badly needs to hear — that he needs serious, prolonged treatment for his mental health, and fast.And , like so many famous people, he’s surrounded by “yes men” who put profits before their clients’ health, then they too need to support his we and family in their bid to get him treatment.It won’t save his presidential chances, but it might just save his le.JOHNNY Depp reportedly referred to Magic Mike star Channing Tatum as “potato-head”.A hot potato though, right SHOW me the boy of seven and I’ll show you the man.Fellow pupils who attended the private Durham School with Dominic Cummings describe him as isive, argumentative and “contemptuous” of his peers, with a look on his face that suggested: “I know better, I’m tolerating you.”A description that will no doubt sound familiar to the entire Cabinet. Without the tolerance bit.A last-breath act of motherly concern that was perhaps down to the phenomenon known as “hysterical strength” – where human beings suddenly find an extreme power in a le-or-death situation.Either way, how heartbreaking that she couldn’t also save herself.THIS is the cover of Sports Illustrated’s  “swimsuit” issue.Or, in the case of Jasmine Sanders, centre, three strategically placed pieces of dental floss.Doubt she’d hear them from LA anyway.GHISLAINE Maxwell broke down in tears while appearing via video link in a New York court.Reportedly, this was because she was denied bail.

And so, consequently, we have gravitated towards the nostalgic food brands that remind us of that time.Though it has to be said that The Bloke’s Heinz Mushroom And Bacon Toast Topper he purchased back in  is a step too far and remains untouched.He was stopped by Border Force teams.Either that or, just like the rest of us, he hired it for an hour and, a few minutes in, drted aimlessly after becoming paralysed with boredom.ONLINE dating frauds have soared by  per cent as con artists exploit loneliness in lockdown then ask to borrow money.The most vulnerable targets were women aged  to .With this in mind, here is my cut-out-and-keep guide to hopefully minimise the chances of this happening to you. If he tells you he’s a spy then he almost certainly isn’t.If he says he’s an airline pilot, only believe it when you see him sitting in a cockpit in full unorm.If he claims all his money is “stuck in Panama”, he’s penniless and after your cash.And finally,he goes incommunicado for several days and claims his phone broke, he’s probably been away with his we and four kids.You have been warned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As long as they are working from home, they are contributing to this country’s problems in three separate ways. The first, and in some ways the most obvious, is that the services they provide are not as good as they should be. I remember fondly that when I was Immigration minister ten years ago, the Passport Service, which in its time had been a national disgrace, won awards for being a model public service.It was quick, flexible and customer friendly.All that has been thrown away under lockdown.There are no appointments in person any more, and I have seen reports that some passports are taking  days to be issued. More than a million passports have expired since March, soyou want to venture abroad next month you may have to be very lucky.If travelling is dficult, driving is not much easier.Anyonewho needs to renew a driving licence is stuck in a long and growing queue.At the other end of the age range, taking your driving test means waiting weeks or months. None of this is good enough in a country aching to get back to normal.The second reason why civil servants should be back at their desks as long as it is safe is that they are often the economic heartbeat of parts of our big cities.Whitehall in London is the most obvious example, but in other cities the public sector is also hugely important for economic activity.Shops, pubs and sandwich bars are open again buttheir customers are miles away they may as well shut their doors once more.As the unlocking has progressed, every MP has been lobbied hard by the sectors who have felt left behind.Gradually the second wave businesses — the nail bars and gyms — are getting their way. But so many of them rely on their location to succeed, and that location works because there are people whose offices are nearby.Empty offices are a death knell for nearby businesses. Footfall is key.The third reason is the most subtle, but perhaps the most important. It is that Government offices need to set an example to the rest of the country.If a private sector employee is wondering whether toto the office, and a neighbour who works for the Government is cheerfully planning to work from home indefinitely, the obvious question arises: “Why should I start commuting again ”Partly for reasons of safety and partly for reasons of convenience, many people have found working from home suits them.This is especially true over the summer, whenyou have a garden it is better to be there two minutes after you stop work than in a sweaty train.What this has come to mean, though, is second-class public services and the throttling of business.It is time for the civil service to set an example.It has had months to make its offices safe, and we have seen the ingenuity of pubs, restaurants and bars in doing the same in much less time, and sometimes with a clientele that will be much less disciplined.So safe offices should now be filling up again, with workers ending those backlogs and restoring the vitality to our cities.Above all they should be sending the signal that Britain can take big steps back towards normal le.A day in the office will mean our streets and shops come back to le.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You must vote Leave in that referendum.”I said to him: “Excuse me, sorry for asking, but are you a Russian ”He looked aghast and said: “Nyet! Why would you think that ”And I said: “Because you speak funny, you have borscht on your tie and you’re glowing, in a radioactive manner, slightly.”He went off around the pub saying the same thing to everyone . Later, I saw him with a bottle of vodka in one hand doing that dance where you crouch down and kick your legs out and shout “ha!” every so often. I wandered up. “Are you SURE you’re not a Russian ”There’s vodka dribbling down his chin and he smells of piroshki dumplings and isotopes. “Nyet! I am Englyishman. My name is Jyohn Smeeth.Definitely not Russian, definitely not KGB, my frent.”“Oh, OK,” I said, “No worries, good night.”“Dosvedanya, toich,” he replied.OK, that didn’t quite happen. But the remainers have got it into their heads that something like it did. We all voted Leave because the Russians interfered in our referendum. Meddled with our democratic process. Which is why we should stop leaving and have another vote.The allegation is that the Russkies tried to persuade us to vote leave by spreading  news around.What  news was that  That the European Union is an authoritarian bureaucracy run by pygmies from Luxembourg  That the EU wanted ever-closer political control over our country That we spent enormous sums of money keeping gibbering oafs like Jean Claude Juncker in office, while subsidising the useless states of Europe I don’t knowspecial agents Ivan and Dmitri were putting that stuff around, but I was well aware of the fact long beforethey were.Is there anything anyone can point to which suggests that the Russkies had an effect  There’s an allegation that they tried to ensure that the Scots voted for independence from the UK. And we should all vote for Jeremy Corbyn in the  election. Not hugely successful meddling operations, then, were they The thing about the alleged Brexit meddling is that it plays into the same narrative the remainers have been peddling for four years. We were all thick, us leavers. We voted Leave because we were DUPED. First by Boris and Nigel Farage. And now by the devilish Russians. Too dense to understand we were being conned, we voted Leave.Looking at the EU today, I’ve never been happier that we voted to get the hell out, incidentally.I have no doubt the Russians meddle in our affairs. I very much hope our own cyber spies are doing the same thing to them. I know the CIA is up to all sorts of tricks.Russia is not a very pleasant country right now and we should complain when it crosses the line — which it does, every month or so. But the idea that it had a decisive effect in our Brexit referendum is an insult to all those of us who thought long and hard and then voted Leave.The remainers can’t get over that we did so. They cannot bear to be defied. Tough. It wasn’t the Russians wot won it. It was us, the ordinary people of this fine country.And we’re still very glad we did.COVID has been good for some people. A lot of better- off people have been able to save loads of money, for example. And they don’t come much better off than the boss of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.Jeff has seen his income rise by a very agreeable £billion. That’s kind of enough money to buy France. So how about this, Jeffrey How about you get your company to pay the right amount of income tax in countries where you make so much money, such as the UK Last year Amazon did £billion worth of business in the UK – and paid £million in tax. That’s a tax rate, then, of two per cent.Not right, is it GOB on a very strange stick Janet Street Porter has been screeching about men. Again.She was having a go at Prince Andrew. Well, fair enough. The bloke is neither use nor ornament. And may soon be up to his neck in legal problems.I agree with the first part of what the toothy old harridan had to say. “Prince Andrew has no skills, no mates and no redeeming features.”Yup, largely agree, pet. But then she went on: “And so many modern middle-agedblokes are like that. That’s why women have drinks parties with their mates on Zoom, binge watch Netflix . . . and only laugh when they’re talking to gay men or their girlfriends.”She ended up by saying that men were becoming “redundant”.Can you imagine the outrageI had a go at a spectacularly useless woman – Janet Street Porter, for example.And then said most women were like her and that women in general are becoming redundant Ooh, there’d be howls of outrage.A LECTURER who said Jewish people had high intelligence has been sacked.Stephen Lamonby also said that Germans were good at engineering.

Otherwise it is too dficult to make sure this data is secure.“So we are working with like-minded democracies across the world to implement this central concept of trusted vendors, trusted networks.”In his first trip to the UK since the coronavirus crisis, Mr Pompeo said countries had to stand up to China.He admitted “confronting evil is hard”, but insisted “freedom loving democracies” like the UK had to work with the US to “convince the Chinese Communist Party to behave”.Speaking a week after the UK barred Chinese firm Huawei from future involvement in G networks over security fears, he added: “We all know Communists, right “We know what authoritarian regimes do. We know the nature of this ideology.“The way in which freedom-loving democracies behave — whether in the military space, the diplomatic space, the commercial space — the Chinese Communist Party simply isn’t behaving in that way. We also know there are hundreds of millions of Chinese people who are demanding that they continue to grow their economy and are looking for things that matter to them.“And that’s why I’ve always talked about this being the Chinese Communist Party driving this bad behaviour.”Mr Pompeo told how, while President Trump may have made China a priority, he could understand why other countries had been slow to take on a regime so quick to “punish” anyone who annoyed them.Mr Pompeo said: “Confronting evil is hard. It requires communicating to your people. There are real costs on the nations that confront it.”Previous US leaders — Republican and Democratic alike — had been affected by China’s belligerence but “just weren’t prepared to admit” to the problem. He said they had believed once China opened up commercially it leaders would conform to international norms, but added: “That simply didn’t happen.”The latest evidence was the way Chinese officials had silenced, or “disappeared”, its scientists who tried to raise the alarm over Covid-. The Secretary of State said: “The world saw it four-square with the massive cover up that took place with the Wuhan virus.“The world is still suffering. We have people dying all across the world, each and every day. And you still have a cover up that is continuing. No nation should permit China to get away with this.”The US has been highly critical of the World Health Organisation. On Tuesday Mr Pompeo even told MPs director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had been “bought” by the Chinese government.But he told The Sun he still hoped a WHO inquiry would uncover the truth. Its secrecy and deceit over Covid has cost countless lives worldwide, including here. Its treatment of Uighur Muslims is evil, its Hong Kong betrayal appalling, its cyber-warfare indefensible.It is too early for us to ban TikTok. But the Tories must ensure the Chinese social media giant is not handing over users’ details to its totalitarian government.National security must trump economic concerns, as Boris Johnson accepts.Compare that with the EU’s response: To sign a bumper trade deal with Beijing.Brussels cares less about safety and human rights than about flogging its wine.Turning to issues in his own country amid Black Lives Matter campaigns, Mr Pompeo said: “There are people who choose to think that America’s founding was somehow fraudulent, because of the terrible tragedy of slavery. But our founders accounted for a country that could continue to reinvent its capacity to extend these rights to a broader set of people — to African Americans, to women.“We have done that and our system has proven resilient. If we forget these core rights we are at risk of floundering. If we do that, I believe that the American way of le is absolutely at risk. I don’t think that will happen.

Its not the first time that the state-run broadcaster has banned the showing of competitive sport. National Basketball Associationcoverage was dropped after the general manager of Houston Rockets Daryl Morey tweeted in support of pro-democracy forces in October ,Bloomberg reported.The Premier League blackout was a response to the UK governments decision to ban Huawei on July .From January next year British telecom companies will be banned from buying Huawei equipment - and the companys tech will be stripped out of the UKs G network by  because of security fears. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian threatened to take any post-Brexit trade deal with China off the table because of the decision.Its a litmus test for the direction where the UK markets would go after Brexit, and whether the UK businesses in China will be provided with an open, fair and non-discriminate environment, he said.The comments threatened the security of leading UK companies which have operations in China including BP,  Diageo, Glaxosmithkline, InterContinental Hotels and Jaguar Land Rover.The Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming tweeted that it was disappointing and the wrong decision by the UK.It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, far and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.The UK government decided to ban Huawei after US sanctions on China meant key components would no longer be able to be made with American equipment.

The protests were initially a backlash to a planned law that would allow Hong Kongers convicted of crimes to be extradited to mainland China and Taiwan.They have since mushroomed into a broader backlash against the police, fuelled by fears of growing control against the Communist Party. The laws will criminalise any act of subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces and it has been alleged that Hong Kong will become a secret police state.The legislation also grants police massive powers to conduct searches without warrants and order internet service providers and s to remove messages deemed to be anti-China.Three million Hongkongers are reportedly eligible for a British Nationalpassport, which is a path towards UK citizenship.

He said: What we have seen throughout this crisis is the strength of the Union in dealing with crucial, crucial things, supporting people through the furlough scheme the work of the army and the armed services in testing and moving people around putting another.Mr Johnson added that the question of Scottish independence had already been settled and those hoping for another go at a vote would have to wait a generation.He said: We had a referendum in , it was decisive, it was, I think by common consent, it was a once in a generation event. When askedhe thought Scotland couldnt survive on its own during the coronavirus crisis he said he thinks the union is a fantastically strong institution. He continued: Its helped our country through thick and thin and is very, very valuable in terms of the support weve been able to give peoplein all corners of the UK. We had a referendum on breaking up the union I think six years ago.  That is not a generation by any computation and I think what people really want is see our whole country coming back strongly and coming together. He flew into Kirkwall Airport before heading to the first in a series of engagements.But the PMs attempt to galvanise support for the Union was met with a frosty welcome to Scotland from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Ms Sturgeon accused Mr Johnson of using the coronavirus crisis as a political weapon and said no one should be crowing or feel satisfied when there were almost , people in the UK dead from the pandemic. She said this lunchtime: I dont think any of us should be trying to use Covid and the pandemic and the crisis situation we have faced and continue to face as some kind of political campaign tool. This is a pandemic that has taken the lives of more than , people across the UK. Weve all tried to do our best but I dont think any of us are in a position to crow or to feel satisfied about this.Its not politics. Every country right now has a real duty to remain focused on doing everything we can to tackle this and not use it as some kind of political weapon.Ms Sturgeon tweeted this morning: One of the key arguments for independence is the ability of Scotland to take our own decisions, rather than having our future decided by politicians we didnt vote for, taking us down a path we havent chosen. His presence highlights that.She then retweeted a cartoon showing Mr Johnson breaking apart the Union, saying the sentiment of her last tweet was neatly illustrated by it. Writing in The Times of Scotland today Mr Johnson said: When I stood on the steps of Downing Street one year ago, I pledged to be a prime minister for every corner of the United Kingdom. Whether you are from East Kilbride or Dumfries, Motherwell or Paisley, I promised to level up across Britain and close the opportunity gap.The past six months have shown exactly why the historic and heartfelt bond that ties the four nations of our country together is so important and the sheer might of our Union has been proven once again.Mr Johnson highlighted all of the money ploughed into Scotland from the Treasury to help businesses and workers stay afloat during coronavirus. He said thanks to those efforts a third of Scottish workers were saved from being laid off. He wrote: There have always been and will always be those who, for their own reasons, devote their time and energy to driving us apart.But the simple truth is that whether it’s a Scottish scientist discovering penicillin in a London lab, an English-born author churning out chapters of Harry Potter in an Edinburgh café, or Westminster and Holyrood working together to secure tens of millions of pounds for the Islands Growth Deal, the people of the UK have always achieved more as four than as one.Support for Scottish Independence is on the rise again, according to analysis of polls done by the Institute for Government. A poll by Panelbase last month had support in favour of independence at a record margin of  per cent to  per cent. The SNP swept up  of Scotland  seats in the election last year which Ms Sturgeon claimed gave her a renewed, refreshed and strengthened mandate” to hold a second referendum on Scotland.Mr Johnson has also talked up the idea of building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland to further cement the union. He said although the Treasurys efforts had saved , Scottish workers, the union was more than just a leboat or a marriage of convenience. He wrote: Being Scottish and British means so much more than someone who lives in this part of the world. He said we are there for each other in sickness and in health. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the PM thought Scotland was too stupid to take care of itself.He told BBC Radio : I think hes going to find that this message is going to go down particularly badly in Scotland.Is he really saying that any other small nation in Europe and any other part of the world doesnt have the capability to deal with the Covid crisis I think the days of telling Scotland that we are either too wee, too poor or too stupid really is over.Throughout the coronavirus crisis, the strategy towards easing lockdown has been fractured as the devolved administration have gone their own way. Ms Sturgeon has been the most openly critical of Mr Johnson, claiming his messaging doesnt make sense and reinforcing the stay at home advice long after he changed it to stay alert.

In a press conference today Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said China firmly opposes the UKs offer of residency to those eligible for BNO passports. China could ditch recognition of a BNO passport as a viable travel document - barring people from leaving Hong Kong with them. He said he considered the UKs offer an unnecessary interference in Hong Kongs affairs and Chinas internal affairs and China would reserve the right to take further action. A No spokesperson said today: Its a fact that BNO passports are issued by the British government - they are legitimate international travel documents.Officials have said all efforts will be taken to ensure Hong Kongers with BNO status are able to travel to the UKChina did try and reject their passports. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said over the weekendChina did such a thing ultimately,they follow through on something like that, there would be little we could do to coercively force them.Home Secretary Priti Patel released more details yesterday announcing Hong Kongers born after July  will have a right to live in the UK for five yearstheir parents hold BNO - and then they can apply to become British after six years. Approximately . million people holding BNO passports will be eligible to live, work and study in the UK once the scheme launches in . Ms Patel has already handed Border Officers the power to grant Hong Kong residents with BNO status and their families leave to stay in the UK. The decision to give Hong Kongers a path to UK citizenship comes in the midst of fiery relationships with China after it imposed tough new national security laws on Hong Kong. The law will criminalise any act of subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces.The heaviest penalty that can be imposed is le in jail, the editor in chief of the Global Times newspaper claimed after citing those who have seen the draft of the law.Under the law, damaging public transport can be considered terrorism and those found guilty will be banned from standing for public office.Some trials will not be held in public while iniduals can be wire-tapped and put under surveillancethey are suspected of criminality.Beijing is also set to establish a security office in Hong Kong with its own law enforcement personnel and with the power to send some cases to mainland China to be tried.Beijing will further have power over how the law should be interpreted and Hong Kong will have to establish its own national security commission to enforce the laws, with a Beijing-appointed adviser.The UK ditched an extradition agreement with Hong Kong and has refused to sell arms to the city-state over fears of Chinese influence.The Government claims the change violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration.The declaration was supposed to guarantee Hong Kong freedom from Chinese rule under the one county, two systems model for  years after the handover of the former British colony in .The law prohibits what Beijing views as secessionist, subversive or terrorist activities or as foreign intervention in Hong Kong affairs.Pro-democracy leader Nathan Law fled to the UK after the law came into effect this month. The Government scrapped plans to give Chinese-state owned Huawei access to Britains G network as Boris Johnson vowed to take a tough stance where it disagreed with China. Mr Johnson has warned he was not going to be pushed into a position of being a knee-jerk Sinophobe on every issue to do with China.He added: What we wont do is completely abandon our relationship with China, China is going to be a giant factor in our geopolitics, weve got to have a calibrated response.Were going to be tough on some things but also continue to engageon others.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have a responsibility to use our  to amply messages of truth and justice,” the team tweeted at the time.Last month, Red Sox outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr was among several black MLB players to participate in a video supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.Team president and CEO Sam Kennedy wrote in a message to team personnel who have participated in social justice protests: “Please know we stand with you.“Silence in the face of injustice is unacceptable.”Red Sox team management said this week they aren’t anticipating that any of their players will kneel during the national anthem this season, but would support anyone who does.Manager Ron Roenicke said on Tuesday, according to MassLive: “Obviously, it’s a very important topic.”“As far as I know, we don’t have guys who are going to take a knee but certainly we will join in with the other concerns.“It’s a very strong statement that we have, for this organization and how we feel about the fight on equality.”“We haven’t told players you have to do anything,” he said. “We’ve given them the rights, which is what this country is all about, and the freedom to do what they feel strongly about.We have said what we think and what we would like them to do, but we have also given them the opportunity to express themselves.“This organization is okay with it.

The human rights coalition said today: “Virtually the entireapparels industry is tainted by forced Uighur and Turkic Muslim labour.”Chloe Cranston, of Anti-Slavery International, said: “There is a high likelihood that every high street and luxury brand runs the risk of being linked to what is happening to the Uighur people.”The Chinese embassies in London and Washington did not respond to requests for comment about the campaigners letter.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the United States earlier this month said the accusation of forced labour in Xinjiang was both  and malicious.The Thomson Reuters Foundation sent emailed questions to more than  leading global retailers about their supply chains in China and the origins of the cotton they sourced.Chinas Uighur Muslims are reportedly being thrown into detention camps for having beards, wearing veils and using the internet.A leaked document detailing the lives of hundreds of Muslims detained in camps in China could be the strongest evidence of Beijing persecuting and punishing religious beliefs, an expert said in February.The personal details of detained Uyghur citizens from southwestern Xinjiang was leaked to CNN and seen by the BBC in  pages of detailed records.The records include how often people pray, how they dress, whom they contact and how their family members behave.It also contains details of investigations into  iniduals, listing their backgrounds, religious habits, and relationships with relatives, neighbours and friends.Chinese authorities say the records are being used to justy the indefinite detention of hundreds of Uighur citizens in heavily fortied internment centers across Xinjiang.The government has claimed it is running a mass deradicalization program targeting potential extremists.Almost all of the brands did not respond directly to the questions, but most said they had anti-forced labour policies and required their suppliers to comply with a code of conduct.All the companies that responded - including Gap, Patagonia and Zara-owner Inditex - said they did not source from factories in Xinjiang, but the majority could not confirm that their supply chain was free of cotton picked from the region.US-based PVH - owner of brands from Calvin Klein to Tommy Hilfiger - said it would cut ties with any factories or mills that produce fabric or use cotton from Xinjiang within a year.Better Cotton Initiative , a global non-profit aiming to improve conditions in the garment sector, said in March it would no longer license so-called Better Cotton from Xinjiang.Companies such as IKEA and HM, who use BCI to source cotton, have previously said they backed the decision to suspend licensing in the region and would no longer source from there.Amid the growing international pressure on China, the US government this month said it blocked an , shipment of hair extensions from a Xinjiang-based business on suspicions that the goods were made with forced labour.A New York Times investigation last week found some Chinese companies making face masks to protect against the coronavirus for both domestic and export markets had used Uighur labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One of the most grim discoveries came in December  when officials found the heads of two people and the partially-skeletonised bodies of five as a wooded ship floated to Japans Sado island.A new investigation by NBC News and Global Fishing Watchhas compiled the data and collected startling anecdotes.This includes the story of one Japanese coastguard who says more than  North Koreans have washed up on beaches in the past two years. The reason for the ghost boats is China has sent a previously invisible armada of industrial boats to illegally fish in North Korean waters, researchers claim.This caused desperate North Korean fishermen to risk their lives by going further out to sea in unsafe boats, which became overwhelmed by the harsh waves and swept away.The Kim Jong-un regime is believed to have put more pressure on the fishermen amid food shortages.In fact so many fisherman have now disappeared at sea that some port towns are called widows’ villages.At least  survivors have been rescued and interviewed in the last seven years by Japanese authorities, but they have reportedly refused to answer most questions and demanded to be ed to the secretive country of North Korea. The dark fleets of Chinese ships do not publicly broadcast their location or appear in public monitoring systems, according to the .For a long time, the ghost ships containing corpses or skeletons in fishing grounds in the Sea of Japan was a mystery.It was originally believed that climate change had forced squid from their natural location, forcing North Koreans to go further at sea and become stranded until they died from dehydration or starvation.Many boats that washed up on shore had no-one on board, leaving Japan suspicious that they were carrying spies or even people who travelled there to spread a disease.GFW are a non-profit organisation campaigning for transparency in the fishing industry.They said more than  Chinese vessels fished illegally in the region in , and  in .The group also believe China likely breached UN sanctions that prohibit foreign fishing in North Koreas territorial waters.Jaeyoon Park, a data scientist from Global Fishing Watch, told NBC News: This is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by a single industrial fleet operating in another nation’s waters.But Chinas Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed in response that they consistently punished illegal fishing.

Public health chiefs plan to impose lockdown restrictions in Blackburn from July  after failing to reduce the population’s stubbornly high infection rate. It currently stands at  cases per , residents - second only to Leicester and twice as high as anywhere  in the UK.The high infection rate is due to Blackburns large proportion of South Asian residents, according to the local public health director Professor Dominic Harrison.Almost three in ten of the town’s population are Indian or Pakistani.Professor Harrison has said the virus has sp widely in Blackburn because cases are “clustering” in the South Asian community, who are more likely to live in large, multi-generational households that are also more likely to be smaller terraced houses.Of  confirmed cases of Covid- in Blackburn in the first fortnight of July,  had South Asian heritage.Worryingly, one in five new cases were residents under the age of .Another area on the watchlist is Pendle in Lancashire which PHE have identied as an area of enhanced support.Bradford, Northampton and Rotherham have called areas of concern due to rising coronavirus cases. Health chiefs were meeting last night to scrutinise the latest infection data across Blackburn, which will inform how drastic the lockdown measures will be.It could involve a Leicester-style lockdown where pubs, shops, hairdressers and schools were closed and only essential travel was permitted.Or it could involve a lighter set of restrictions initially.A formal decision will be made on Monday, when the next review is due.A source involved in drawing up the measures said “plans have actively been made” for extra lockdown restrictions to come into effect next Friday. That date has been chosen as it is the day before a raft of new venues reopen nationwide.At the very least it will delay the reopening of venues scheduled to open their doors this weekend and next week.It means gyms, sports centres, swimming pools, beauty salons, nail bars and casinos in Blackburn will remain shut.Cllr Mohammed Khan, Leader of Blackburn with Darwen Council: “We need to keep up the momentum with our strong prevention work so we agree its sensible not to relax the easing of restrictions at the moment to stop the spread.“We have already decided to delay the opening of our council leisure facilities along with introducing other localised prevention measures.“We feel that accelerating our control measures in this way will assist us to move out of having higher COVID rates even faster - we are grateful for the Government’s help in our local plans on this.”It will also delay the changes in the blanket work from home guidance for workers in Blackburn, which are due to change from August  to allow staff toto their offices.And blanket rules barring all but essential use of public transport - due to be dropped for the rest of England next Saturday - will also remain in place.Small wedding receptions involving less than  guests will also not be allowed to go ahead in Blackburn.The plans are being led by the local authority, who have been praised by the Government for their proactive and sophisticated planning, in contrast to the botched record of Leicester City council.A government source said: “At the very least, the next set of easements won’t happen. “It’s a decision they’re taking locally and it’s been very locally led and we don’t want it to be Westminster saying this or that. “It will be gyms won’t be able to open in Blackburn as they battle to get their transmission down.”Last week Professor Harrison warned Blackburn had two weeks to reduce its infection rate or  lockdown measures would have to be re-imposed.Areas of concern have the highest prevalence of cases. The local area is taking targeted actions to reduce the infection rate with additional testing.Areas of enhanced support are at medium to high risk of intervention. There is a more detailed plan, with expert advice and additional mobile testing.Areas of intervention are areas where special measures are put in place that dfer from the rest of England due to signicant spread.

Why with us If talks do collapse, so be it. Brussels may need a few years to get their heads around an independent Britain.Then, we suspect, a deal will be done.Its in their hands, to a large extent.EU negotiators will come back to London next week for informal discussions, with another round of official talks scheduled for  August onwards.Mr Barnier said today that the bloc was prepared to negotiate right until the th hour, even though both sides wanted one done ahead of time.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ordinarily MPsto their constituencies to take a well-deserved break, catch-up on casework and enjoy a summer fete or two. Prime Ministers demonstrate their patriotic credentials by getting snapped holidaying in a UK seaside resort. And junior ministers and shadow ministers get their moment in the proverbial sun while the big beasts are away. This summer’s recess is going to be a time of great unknowns Both the PM and his Labour counterpart will be strategically planning maximum use of the time, whilst bracing themselves for the next stages of the coronavirus crisis. The approach required is the same, but for dferent reasons. And for the PM the next six weeks could spell trouble. Without the daily routines of Westminster and the verbal jousts of the House of Commons there will be a gap in the headlines. The Government’s ability to control the agenda with a daily stream of seemingly positive news will be limited.  Johnson has already stumbled badly in his response to the pandemic, from the deadly mismanagement of care homes to his inability to get all his cabinet ministers to give the same advice in public. The PM will be out and about shoring up public support because he knows he needs to hang onto people who aren’t naturally Tory voters.  He’ll be offering some turbo-charged ‘levelling up’ - but the slogans will be as questionable as they are brazen. And the likelihood is, they’ll be overtaken by Covid-related developments the PM can’t influence. In contrast, Keir Starmer has momentum. The Labour party is back in the ring and Starmer has passed the early tests of his leadership, showing judgement, competence and resolve both in holding the government to account and in starting to change the Labour party. He knows the job has hardly started, but most people’s impressions of the new leader are positive, which is all that can be asked after four months in office. Labour’s task for the summer is to continue making progress.  In  the party lost votes from every type of voter, in almost every corner of the country, something that Starmer doesn’t shy away from. The elections in May are coming into sharp focus and the Party must show real progress, particularly in Scotland. To do so, Starmer has work to do with an audience closer to home – his party, and former Labour voters.We can expect him to be spending a lot of time this summer in Scotland, as well as those ‘red wall’ towns in the north, midlands, and Wales. This is where recess favours him. Rebuilding those ties is best done outside of the parliamentary glare. Both Starmer and Johnson face a big challenge in cutting through to their respective audiences at a time when most of us would rather switch off.

People will have to wear one over their nose and mouth in all shops and supermarkets in England. Post offices, banks, railway stations and airports are also on the list. It will also be mandatory to wear a face covering when buying takeaway food and drink. Labour and retailers say the Tories have been mired in “confusion”.After months claiming masks were unnecessary or would give  confidence, No changed the rules as part of new restrictions in a bid to prevent a potentially catastrophic second wave of Covid- this winter. The UK’s official death toll rose today by  to ,, although the true figure is much higher. Ministers said face coverings are now part of the “new normal” and the public will be told to wear them for the foreseeable future. Stores can refuse entry to those without a mask or who fail to wear one properly. Police can use “reasonable force” to remove the shoppers and may impose £ fines. But officers say the regulations, which will be in place for a year, will be almost impossible to enforce. Venues such as eat-in restaurants, pubs, hairdressers, beauty salons, gyms, leisure centres, cinemas and theatres will all be exempt – as long as they have other protection measures in place.  It is already compulsory to wear face coverings on public transport. They can be fabric, such as a scarf, but research suggests home-made coverings need to be at least two layers thick, preferably three. The disabled and under-s are among those exempt from the new rules. People can briefly remove their mask , for example, staff ask for ID. Public Health England has warned parents not to use face coverings on babies and young children due to the risk of choking and suffocation.  Ministers have been urged to do more to protect those exempt from wearing masks after a charity highlighted “horric” cases of disabled people being abused. The public are advised to wash their hands before putting a covering on or off, and to avoid touching their face while wearing one. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “As we move into the next stage of easing restrictions, it is vital we continue to shop safely so we can make the most of our fantastic retail industry... Everyone must play their part in fighting this virus by following this new guidance.” But Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth told the Mirror: “After weeks of ministerial muddle and Cabinet confusion finally face masks will be mandatory in shops. “Why it took so long to get to this point is yet another example of this Government’s slow response to the pandemic.” The Tory announcement came after last-minute confusion over how and where the rules applied.  Some ministers seen in takeaways recently wore masks and some did not. The rules clary that in places such as McDonald’s, you do not need a maskyou are sitting down to eat. But you doyou are taking food or drink away. Major retailers and unions said they would not ask staff to enforce the rules in case it puts them in harm’s way. Paddy Lillis, of shopworkers’ union Usdaw, said: “They are already dealing with more abuse than normal and this could be another flashpoint.” Some employers said they would not require their staff to wear coveringsthey work behind plastic screens. Tom Ironside, of the British Retail Consortium, said: “Retailers are doing all they can to support necessary safety regulations and will play their role in communicating and encouraging the Government’s policy on face coverings.  “While enforcement of this policy will be handled by the police, the ultimate responsibility remains with customers.” Ministers have been accused of mixed messaging on the issue. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the latest regulations contradicted what the industry had previously been told and it was “very late in the day” for confirmation. She added: “It’s really unhelpful to have that confusion because the single biggest thing we need now is to rebuild consumer confidence and that needs clear, unambiguous messaging.” Britain’s most senior police officer said she hoped any shoppers refusing to wear masks will be “shamed” into complying. politan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick addedstaff were worried and had attempted to handle the issue then officers would try to help. She said: “Calling the police should be a last resort for dealing with a mask issue.” "},{"url":null,"title":"new face mask law could","story":"NewsNew face mask law could see people fined for not covering their nose properlyIt will be compulsory to don a face covering in all shops and supermarkets in England from Friday - with fines for those who do not complyShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL NewsMasks will be compulsory in shops from Friday\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Police have the power to fine people up to £ for failing to obey the new regulations, which were published only hours before the changes were due to come into effect. The regulations state that a face covering covers a personaposs nose and mouth - meaning those who wear the mask without covering their nose could be breaching rules.  Anyone flouting the rules can be slapped with a £ penalty, which reduced to £paid within  days. Police have legal powers to enforce the rules but they are expected to only use them as a last resort. Downing Street played down the prospect of fines, saying people would be advised on how to wear a mask correctly. Asked whether people would be fined for incorrect usage, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: “I think what would happen at that point is people would be given the advice as to how properly to wear it to ensure it’s effective. That would be the sensible approach.”  The PMaposs spokesman said No did not expect members of the public to report those who were not wearing masks in shops from Friday due to voluntary take-up of the policy. He said: Youaposve seen over the course of recent months the British public have voluntarily chosen to follow the guidance because they want to help slow the spread of the virus and Iaposm sure that will be the case with face coverings as well. Some people are exempt from the new rules, such as anyone with a disability that means they cannot put on a face covering or someone accompanying another person who relies on lip reading.

Face coverings will be mandatory in most indoor public areas in England from Friday, with exclusions for people with physical or mental illnesses or disabilities. The full list for the exemptions is below, but there are fears that not enough people are aware of those who donapost have to wear a covering under the regulations.A charity is calling for more to be done following horric cases of disabled people being abused. Fazilet Hadi, a policy manager at Disability Rights UK, said she has already heard several stories of people being confronted on public transport - where masks have been mandatory since June - despite having legitimate reasons for not wearing one. Ms Hadi and a number of people exempt from the rules said they fear further abuse as the use of face coverings becomes more widespread. Ms Hadi called for a Government advertising campaign to raise awareness of the exemptions. She said: Iaposd love to see Government advertising... Iaposm sure Iaposm not going to. People really shouldnapost be confronting other people. James OaposRourke, , from Chingford, fears his brother Tony, , who has a moderate to severe learning disability, will be subjected to inevitable abuse and prejudice. He said: If you can wear a mask, you should wear a mask. However, for those who cannot or will not because of their disability, then weaposre just painting a big target on them. Mr OaposRourke said it is great charities and others have created exemption cards to explain why a mask is not being worn, but he warned: Theyaposre not official, theyaposre not endorsed by Government. Mr OaposRourke added his brotheraposs carers have avoided places where he could be challenged, but said by avoiding , that is denying him his right to go on public transport. We heard horric stories from the disability hate crime network about disabled people whoaposve already been challenged on public transport. We really urge the public to be kind and assume that the people around them arenapost wearing it for a reason. Jen, , from Birmingham, who did not want to give her surname, is autistic and does not have to wear a mask due to anxiety.She gave an example of a confrontation she endured recently on a bus. She said: I go to sit down and there is a sea of faces looking at me like aposhow dare you get on our bus without your face covered apos. Jen received an apology after explaining she is exempt, but said of the new law in shops: I would bet my left kidney that weaposre going to have trouble.

Top Tory Brandon Lewis dismissed concerns about receiving some £, from donors linked to the country - and said he was proud that they were allowed to be involved in politics. It emerged that  Tory ministers and two members of the Intelligence and Security Committee, which published a long-delayed report into Russian interference in British democracy, had taken money from figures linked to Russia. The donations, which are legal and had been properly declared, emerged as the ISCaposs Russia report raised concerns about an influx of Russian money into the UK since the s, Mr Lewis was listed as receiving £, from long-time Tory donor Lubov Chernukhin, the we of one of Vladimir Putinaposs former ministers, and £, from Alexander Temerko, a former chief of a Russian arms company, The Times reported. Other senior Tories who received personal donations or money for their local constituencies from the two donors include Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland. Mrs Chernukhin famously bid £, at a lavish Tory fundraiser to win a game of tennis with Boris Johnson.Mr Lewis, a former Tory chairman, defended the donations, saying they had been properly declared.He told the Today programme: I think we need to be fairly clear about this so we donapost get the facts wrong - these are British citizens.They are properly declared, we do not accept funds from foreign nationals. These are British citizens and I would absolutely defend the right of any British citizen, including the people youaposve outlined who have donated to myself and others, to play their full part in our democracy.That doesnapost just mean voting, that means supporting,they want to, political parties and political candidates, and Iaposm very proud of the fact that, as a country, we allow British citizens to do that. Askedthe donors gave vast sums out of love of the Conservative Party and admiration of inidual ministers, he said: I think they do it because they see that the Conservative Party and a Conservative prime minister is the party that delivers for the UK. Tory MPs Theresa Villiers and Mark Pritchard- both members of the ISC - also received donations to their constituency branches from Mrs Chernukhin and Mr Temerko.

But others appeared to have been getting lost because of beach-goersapos behaviour. She said the centre has received more than half a dozen reports of pups being chased off beaches across the region already this year. We are like a seal orphanage at the moment, Ms Charles said. She continued: We are becoming increasingly concerned by reports that some members of the public are chasing pups back into the water when they see them resting on the beach. This is really concerning because the reason the pup is resting on the beach is likely because they are exhausted due to being so young and still building up their strength. MsCharles said one tiny pup they are caring for is believed to have become separated from his mum on July .

Among celebs backing the call for a ban, is comic Ricky Gervais, who said: “Britain must take a lead and bring in a law now to help end this horric abuse.” Naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham added his voice to the call, saying: “The brutality to Asian elephants in tourism is often described as the worst animal cruelty of all. I completely support this great move to ban adverts for unethical resorts and practices.” While explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, added: “It is imperative the Government acts immediately to ban such disgraceful and unconscionable advertising.” Travel association ABTA says it encourages travel companies to not offer tours in which animals are abused. But campaign group Save The Asian Elephants says a law is needed as numerous firms ignore ABTA guidelines. There is support from the world of politics, with Labour’s environment spokesman Luke Pollard saying: “If the travel sector cannot step up and meet the challenge of removing holidays and excursions that abuse animals then new laws are the next step.” "},{"url":null,"title":"couple who live one bedroom","story":"NewsCouple who live in one bedroom flat with  kids told to stop having childrenShirley Purton, , and partner, Luke Lumbard, , live in a tiny one bedroom flat with their three children in Thetford, Norfolk, which is run by housing provider Havebury HousingShareCommentsByJohn Bett:,  JUL News Luke Lumbard, holding Lareece, Shirley Purton holding Matilda, and Isabell \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

But Baroness Doreen Lawrence – who became a Labour Peer in  – announces she is leaving the foundation she set up in his memory to focus on creating a national Stephen Lawrence Day. Here, she outlines plans to make April  a global event through her new Stephen Lawrence Day Foundation. She also talks about Black Lives Matter and the disproportionate number of Covid- deaths among black, Asian and other ethnic minorities. Stephen, , was murdered in a racist attack in Eltham, South-East London, on April  .  The Stephen Lawrence Trust was my le. Every day for years, I was in my little office trying to turn Stephen’s legacy into opportunities and chances for other disadvantaged young people. We supported young people in architecture who wouldn’t have stood a chance and we opened our doors to creative and professional people who needed somewhere to learn their craft and get ahead. But then two important things happened. The first was entering the House of Lords, which was something I had never thought of. But the welcome I got from the peers was amazing. I realised my fight for justice was generating such levels of respect, his name was just getting bigger. It was not only being taught in schools nationwide but also being actively celebrated in the heart of Parliament, by senior people who genuinely cared about equality. I had less and less involvement with the Trust after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge came to visit us at my request a few years ago but I was making progress in the House of Lords in other ways. The next big thing to happen was when then Prime Minister, Theresa May, told me she agreed my request for a Stephen Lawrence Day. The day she made the official announcement in St Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square was one of the proudest days of my le. For Stephen and for others like him. Before him and since him. Innocent lives whose loss is now being recognised fully and properly. I realised I wanted to bring all the forces of good together, all the support I had received over  years into a day for all marginalised people who have suffered disadvantage or prejudice. The Day itself will be a culmination and celebration of activities and programmes that will run across the year. I wanted those forces of good to stand proud on a day which says: “Are we going back to the bad old days when it took a fight to get justice for a boy killed for doing nothing wrong ” No. We are not. And I realised I wanted to be hands-on in achieving this important national day – which defies anyone who still thinks, “What’s all the fuss about some black teenager being killed years and years ago ” I want such people to feel so out of step with their own country – as it celebrates a le like Stephen’s cut short by racist violence – that they know they are isolated in a tiny minority. Because the rest of the country is on our side, on the side of justice. So I decided to leave the Trust and start a standalone body specically aimed at making Stephen Lawrence Day a highlight of the year. A day for everyone with a cause which deserves justice. And a day of celebration of what we have achieved – across that year, until that year – and what we are going to achieve in the future. People kept asking me to say something about the Black Lives Matter movement and the protests after George Floyd was murdered by police in America. But I’ve always believed in action rather than words so I was busy building a new organisation which will say loudly and clearly on a UK national day for everyone that black lives matter. Black lives always matter, of course, and we’ll hold events, activities and build relationships which will shout this loudly across the whole year, every year.  That will be more effective than a few quotes from me stating the obvious that I detest and deplore the waste of innocent black lives… of any young le, any injustice. The BLM cause was well supported in the UK after George’s murder when thousands defied lockdown to take to the streets. I applauded their motives. They care and they are right to care. They put their lives at risk for what they believed in by going out marching. This country has been blighted by racism over the years and they were right to highlight the fact that the creativity and experience of black people has helped to build this country into what it is today. But marching and protesting is not for all of us and many people could not take those risks during a pandemic. As we know, black, Asian and ethnic minorities are especially at risk and lives have been lost. Next April, Stephen Lawrence Day will allow thousands of people, from the very young to the very old, families and friends to show the world that black lives matter by attending our national events. And this won’t be an improvised protest it will be an official Day, a nationwide expression against injustice and cruelty a celebration of tolerance and ersity. It will be a day for all disadvantaged sections of society, for everyone who has suffered prejudice or injustice.

As restrictions ease, the Very Big Family Le Survey gives a glimpse of how le has changed over the past few months and how families view the “new normal”. The good news is that two thirds of parents of teenagers say all that time spent together at home has had a positive effect on their family. And the same applies to almost three quarters of those with kids under . Many families have created perfect memories by doing new activities together, such as playing board games, baking, walking and cycling.  Watching TV and streaming services have also provided family bonding time. Very asked parents to reflect on the past few months as they prepare for their children toto school full time. While for some it was stressful, juggling work, home schooling and quality time with the family, others found it fun and inspiring. Writer Gemma Cheetham lives with husband Mike and their two children, Ava-Violet, six, and Gabriel, one . She says the lockdown has made it feel like things have slowed down. She explained: For the first few weeks of lockdown I was working from home, and it was a struggle as Gabriel wanted to be with me all the time.  I’d end up logging on to work early in the morning, stopping at pm and starting again in the evening to make up lost hours. Normally, Mike would have taken the kids out, but when the restrictions came in he couldn’t do that. Then I got furloughed, and at first I enjoyed home schooling Ava-Violet and doing practical things like planting in the garden and baking banana bread.  But I started to notice a real dference in her. She just wanted to stay in the house. Even though we reassured her, she’d say things like, ‘I don’t want to go back to school, I want to stay safe and I want my family to stay safe.’ When her village school reopened, and she was in a small class bubble, she went back to her old self straightaway. She was glad to have the routine again, but she still likes having me at home. I feel like le has slowed down and we’ve been able to just appreciate each other’s company more. Another family feeling the benefit of spending more time together are the Blankstones. Mum Lisa and dad Mark live with daughter Olivia,  .  Estate agent Lisa told us: Olivia was due to sit her GCSEs and obviously she was upset when they were cancelled but since then she’s enjoyed being able to just chill out. I was furloughed, and Mark has his own optician’s which closed temporarily, so we were all at home. Olivia had schoolwork at first, but that eased off so we had lots of free time. We walked every day, exercised at home doing Joe Wicks and David Lloyd sessions. Olivia kept in touch with friends via video chats, and although she said a few times she wished she could see them properly, she was fine. She was disappointed to have our holiday cancelled, but she’s going to college and she’ll be more than ready to have some normality back again by September. We all get on well, so the biggest challenge for us was not being able to see other members of the family. Because he runs his own business, Mark said he’s never spent so much time with Olivia and he’s loved that. When you’re busy you feel like you’re always chasing your tail, but lockdown meant we all had more time.

Lizzy Willis, , was struggling to sleep when she ed home from her sht on the intensive care unit at St Maryaposs Hospital in Paddington, London. She applied to the beauty contest on the off chance of being accepted - but has now got through to next weekaposs virtual semi-final. Lizzy was inspired to apply to Miss England by Dr Bhasha Mukherjee, who took a career break as a junior doctor to win last yearaposs competition. The dedicated nurse, from Maida Vale, West London, said: It was really really random.Follow all coronavirus updates here on our live blogI couldnapost sleep after a night sht one day and I was reading some news articles and I came across the previous winner, Bhasha Mukherjee, and saw sheaposs a doctor I just thought aposoh I could do thatapos I had a look at the website and just decided to send in an application and managed to make it to the semis.Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the contestants will not meet each other or the judges in person.They will be connected via the video calling app Zoom and submit their entries remotely. Lizzy, who is also a British Army reservist, added: The remote nature of it has definitely made it very weird.  We had a trial run the other day and it was quite interesting seeing everyone up on the screen. I guess when youaposre in person you kind of have a lot more freedom with your body language and how you present yourself and what you wear and things. When youaposre just sitting in front of a screen, I have only got a phone screen to record on. Youaposve just got that tiny window to present yourself and sell yourself, so it is tough. Lizzy started her nursing career just before the coronavirus outbreak last December and has been working round the clock ever since.  She said: It has been the busiest and craziest time of my le, definitely in my career. I only just started when this first kicked off. Iaposve been talking a lot with my family about whataposs going on because theyaposre also in the medical profession, so I know they can really relate to how busy and how crazy it is. We are working in conditions and pressures, unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. I had been a qualied nurse for four months before it all kicked off and suddenly I was expected to be more senior and teach the staff drafted in to help.  It was very surreal, nurses and doctors walking round in full PPE with patients either on a ventilator or needing constant monitoring to seethey were deteriorating. While not caring for the sick, Lizzy said sheaposs been focusing on the competition, adding: There are so many elements that there are to do. For example, thereaposs a Miss Eco round. Part of that is making your own outfit and presenting it to the judges. Iaposve been spending quite a few evenings sewing little garments and itaposs been really therapeutic after work.  It is made from old clothing and the idea is to reuse to make something brand new. The competition is something new for me but itaposs also a new way of working.

But alongside those have been the quiet, almost everyday acts of ­kindness which have changed lives and helped so many. At the start of the lockdown we teamed up with the Red Cross for a Kindness Will Keep Us Together campaign and more than , have signed up to help someone in need. From driving people to hospital appointments to shopping trips and delivering essential medicines, more than , acts of kindness have been carried out across the country. Here, just a few of those Red Cross workers, helpers, and those they helped, reveal what a dference it has made to their lives. Paul Hunter: Straight back into hospital suffering from coronavirus Paul Hunter contracted coronavirus early on in the pandemic, a week after being discharged from hospital following a leg complaint. Given his age, underlying health conditions including diabetes, breathing problems and having already suffered a heart attack, he was especially at risk. The -year-old spent around three weeks on the ward, during which time three people there died. Paul, from Croydon, South London, remembers: “It was scary. I had to start to take oxygen. I couldn’t walk, and I couldn’t stand.”  The dad-of-one, whose daughter lives  miles away, was visited by the British Red Cross’ local independent living team, which visited him wearing full PPE gear. Paul says: “They came and had a chat and asked how I was and everything. They said, ‘We’ll walk with you’. I walked up and down the ward and back again. I started getting a bit better.” After he ed home the Red Cross provided him with a walker to get around and a support worker. Scott, the support worker assigned to Paul, said of his Red Cross role: “A lot of it is... just keeping these people with their heads above water until some kind of normality comes back in.” Graham Bond: apos I found a crutch to lean on when I couldn’t cope’  After coming out of hospital following kidney surgery in March, Graham Bond struggled. The partially disabled -year-old found the transition back home disorientating. The Red Cross helped him with food shopping and gave him “breathing space” so he could arrange longer-term support. Former yachtsman Graham, from Tadley, Hants, said: “I was desperate for help. There was no food in the house and I was struggling to get out of bed, never mind get to the shops. My le was already a bit limited, but in lockdown it got even worse. “But knowing someone is there at the end of the phone makes me feel less isolated. It’s really helped me cope with the lockdown.” He describes the organisation as a “crutch to lean on when I couldn’t cope”. Debbie Lister, Graham’s support worker, says: Graham was our very first referral in the coronavirus lockdown period.It was the first time we had had to put on full PPE in a real scenario. We were obviously apprehensive but Graham’s operation had left him exceptionally vulnerable and he needed our support. Graham was... daunted about being at home on his own. We gave him the reassurance that we were available to support, in whatever way we could. Carrie Reid and daughter Amy: Mum and daughter working -hour ambulance shts Ambulance support volunteers Carrie Reid and daughter Amy have been helping people get to and from hospital. The Londoners are usually first aid trainers, but have been doing -hour shts, in full PPE, to transport patients. Carrie, , said: “We were told we’d be dealing with Covid patients. That was a bit daunting, mostly because of my age.But I’m a qualied emergency response volunteer with a nursing background. I would not be able to live with myselfI’d stayed at home and done nothing.”  Amy, , did not start helping with the coronavirus response at the same time as Carrie because she initially feared she had the virus herself, but she joined her mum once that was, thankfully, found not to be the case. She says: “I felt with the skills I had it was very important to step forward”. It is a physically demanding job for both of them, but there is also the emotional pressure to manage. Amy says: “Some of it has been hard but there have been a lot of positives. “When I saw the first patient clapped off the ward that was very ‘awww’.” Red Cross volunteer Mamadou: ‘I feel at peace here, it’s a gt’  Red Cross volunteer Mamadou is originally from Senegal in West Africa and left his home as a refugee in , eventually claiming asylum in Northern Ireland. Although he has a degree in physics and has a special interest in solar energy, Mamadou’s immigration status means that he isn’t currently permitted to take up paid work. However, that hasn’t stopped him putting both his considerable talents and warm personality to good use during these months of the coronavirus pandemic. Mamadou now volunteers three or four days a week with the Red Cross in Belfast, helping provide members of the public with short-term wheelchair loans. He says: “I like doing something to help the community – it’s a great opportunity and actually feels like a kind of gt to me. “I feel at peace here.” Theresa Mgadzah Jones: ‘Stuck inside, they are so lonely’  Theresa Mgadzah Jones has been helping single mums who are also refugees, through a partnership with the Birth Partner Project in Cardf. Project coordinator Theresa and her team support women seeking asylum during pregnancy, birth and the first months with their new baby. Theresa says: “After the restrictions to stay at home came into place, the Birth Partner Project referred two young mothers to the Red Cross. They had new babies, and as well as having another child, one of the mothers had an underlying health issue.” Before visiting them, Theresa spoke to them on the phone to introduce herself and get a picture of the kind of support the new mothers would need. She says: “They seemed very down. They told me it is dficult because of not being able to get out. They are stuck inside, feeling very lonely.” Theresa picks up food packages from a local hub and delivers them to the new mothers, along with formula, nappies and wipes for the babies. Adetola, one of the women supported by Theresa, says: “The first time Theresa delivered a parcel, I wanted to message her to let her know how grateful I was for her help. ‘Thank you very much for your help, God bless the Red Cross’ I wrote.” “Because I am shielding I only see my children, so I am happy to see Theresa and other people from the Red Cross when they bring the food.” Hannah Vaughan and Olivia Mountjoy: Pupils are made of the write stuff"},{"url":null,"title":"kfc defends grim kitchen photos","story":"NewsKFC defends grim kitchen photos showing dirt and grime on floors near counterTakeaway bosses defended the state of the kitchen at one of their branches in PlymouthShareCommentsByKelly-Ann MillsEve Watson:,  JUL NewsThe KFC in Plymouth \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The branch in Plymouth was thrown into the spotlight as pictures appeared to show the floors behind the counters near food storage and preparation units covered in dirt and grime. The restaurant, which threw open its doors post-lockdown on May , commands a five-star food hygiene rating following a thorough inspection in .Many on Facebook denounced KFC for failing to uphold premium standards and complained of poor dining experience, Devon Live reports.But the company has sought to put to bed any fears about cleanliness at the restaurant up at Crownhill Retail Park. And the organisation has paid tribute to the hard-working staff who serve diners around the clock. A KFC spokeswoman said the photos were taken aposmid-clean upapos and that the team members at the restaurant aposworked hardapos to clean before opening to the public. They added: Looks like these pictures caught us mid-clean up. Rest assured, our team members worked hard to get this sorted ahead of opening for our guests. We’re proud of our five star rating, and intend to keep it that way! Plymouth City Council said it could not disclose information about specic food outlets, but urges customers or staff to voice their concerns as they investigate all complaints. A spokeswoman previously said: “We investigate all complaints relating to food safety concerns and cannot comment on complaints about specic food outlets until our investigations are complete.“Residents can let us knowthey have seen poor hygiene in Plymouth food outlets, have bought food which is contaminated, unsafe or not labelled or have any other food safety concerns via our website.”The brancg re-opened on May  after shutting due to the UK-wide lockdown, and welcomed customers back by hanging signs outside the premises to inform hungry customers it was back open for business.

But two days later, she was served with an eviction notice – dated for after the Government eviction ban ends on August . The housing charity Shelter is warning of “a wave of homelessness” from that date and says , renters may be at risk of ‘Covid-eviction’ when the Government ban ends. Despite warnings from housing charities, Parliament went home for the summer this week without resolving the issue. By the time MPson September , the eviction suspension order will have expired by nine days – leaving some families facing winter on the streets. “I honestly don’t know what we are going to do,” Jeanny, , says. “One of my children has autism so really struggles with change. The rental market here has gone crazy. There’s nothing. I’m lying awake at night worrying myself sick because at this moment we have nowhere to go.” Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, says the Secretary of State for Housing, Robert Jenrick, promised nobody would lose their home due to coronavirus. “But that promise has been shattered,” she says. “The Government has gone on its summer break having failed to make the vital tweaks to the law that are needed to properly protect renters. “A wave of homelessness is coming. Hundreds of thousands of people could lose their homes following the evictions ban lting on August . Some people could even face sleeping on the streets this winter.”  This week we spoke to three working mums, all of whom now face eviction. Sarah – not her real name – has lived with her grown-up disabled daughter, Alison, in a rented property in Greater Manchester, for two years. The women both work in a factory, and Sarah also has two cleaning jobs. They had previously been model tenants but are now being threatened with eviction. “It’s been awful,” Sarah, , says. “Two weeks ago, my daughter took a load of tablets because of it all and had to be admitted to hospital. They’re still saying they’re going to evict us. “I’ve come back late at night from my evening cleaning job, and the landlord has had people sat outside the house. I think they’re trying to intimidate us. I don’t know where we’re going to go.”  The women fell short with their rent after Alison, who has arthritis in her spine, had a fall at work, and Sarah’s cleaning work dried up because of Covid-. “We spoke to the agent to seewe could pay extra the month after and sent a copy of the sick note,” Sarah says. “We just wanted a bit of time. But two days later a letter arrived to say we were being evicted.” Shelley,  – who also asked us to change her name – rents in the Wirral with her four children. Her income, as a self-employed cleaner who also takes in ironing, was drastically hit by lockdown. She got a month behind with rent but caught up again. Even so, her landlord says he now wants the property back.  “As soon as we get to August , I’ll have to leave but I don’t have anywhere to go,” Shelley says. “I spoke to Shelter because I was worried thatI don’t have anywhere to live, they might try and take my kids off me. The demand on houses locally is ridiculous. I’ve been so stressed by it all. My mental health has been really bad – I ended up at the doctor’s because it was making me ill. It feels like the whole world is falling apart. A roof over your head is safety, and we don’t have that.” Jeanny is studying for a masters degree and tops up her student loans working at a Clarks shoe shop, but hours have been dficult to come by.

She was given the devastating news she had stage four incurable cancer. The mum of three from Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: I didnapost want to waste the doctorsapos time for a tummy ache, the NHS had so much going on. In June the pain got so bad I went to the hospital. Originally they thought they were two cysts but after the radiologists had a look at them they confirmed they were two tumours. I had to wait a week to hear back from the oncology specialist- it was a very long week. I was in shock, it never crossed my mind, a stomach ache could have been cancer. I was thinking I might have eaten the wrong thing or maybe I have an intolerance to dairy or something like that.  Never in a million years I thought it was going to be as bad as it is. The chef, whose mum to Lewis, , Lillian,  and eight-year-old Gabriel, was diagnosed with appendicitis before lockdown after experiencing tummy trouble. Since the cancer diagnosis, Johanna has started aggressive chemotherapy for the next six months. She added: Itaposs such a rare type of cancer, the only reason they found out was because of the CT scan.  I had a blood test in the spring and was told I had inflammation of the appendix- the doctors prescribed antibiotics and painkillers for appendicitis and sent me home. Because of Covid-, they couldnapost do CT scans or surgery - all non-essential procedures had been stopped due to the virus. If I never had the appendicitis symptoms they would never have found out.

The handwritten note has come to light as it goes on sale, expected to fetch about £. She wrote: I do wonder what the next ten years will bring, the last ten I have learnt a great deal in an interesting way! Charles and Diana had a notoriously dficult marriage in which both are acknowledged to have had extra-marital affairs.

Kimberley Hattersley-Barton, , who also only has two thirds of her tongue left, is releasing pictures as a warning to others. Kimberley, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, had already overcome cancer at a young age after she was diagnosed with rare childhood soft tissue cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma, when she was just  months old. After several rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy she was given the all clear at two-and-a-half-years-old, but she was left with several long-term chronic health problems including kidney failure and cardiomyopathy. But then in December  at the age of , Kimberley noticed a bump on her tongue whilst she was brushing her teeth. She initially ignored it and thought it was down to her braces, which can cause mouth irritation. The bump slowly got bigger over the next few days, so Kimberley was referred to the head and neck clinic where she was told the devastating news that she had squamous cell carcinoma on her tongue which had spread to her neck lymph nodes.  Taken aback by her diagnosis, Kimberley had to undergo surgery on March , , to remove the affected area of her tongue which included a gruelling neck dissection, where all of her lymph nodes on her left side were removed, and followed up with  rounds of radiotherapy over six-and-a-half-weeks and she completed treatment on May , .For almost four years Kimberley’s check-ups had been clear but in April , at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, she received the devastating news that her tongue cancer had ed after she’d noticed her tongue was so sore she was struggling to eat soft foods. Luckily Kimberley’s second diagnosis was caught at the earliest stage and after surgery to remove the affected section of her tongue and lymph nodes on the right side of her neck as a precaution on May , , she has thankfully not needed any further treatment.Head and neck cancers are more common in people over the age of  or in those who have been exposed to risk factors such as alcohol and tobacco which makes Kimberley’s story an anomaly so she’s keen to spread awareness for her type of cancer and has set up her Instagram page, @kimberleys_lewiththeribbon . “Prior to the first tongue cancer diagnosis I had braces on my teeth, I spotted the tumour when cleaning my braces and thought nothing of it as I have a geographical tongue anyway,” said Kimberley. “It was a couple of days later when I realised that area wasn’t symmetrical to the other side of my tongue and saw it was a lump. I didn’t notice any symptoms other than my ear was throbbing a lot, it was at my first appointment I was told that was because the cancer had spread and was putting pressure on my ear.  “I was in disbelief of what I heard, I was upset and confused at what had just been said as I wasn’t aware that it [the cancer] was in my neck also. I got more upset when the doctor got me to feel the area under my ear and I felt a solid lump in my neck. “I remember crying and saying ‘I don’t want it to come back’, but it was too late and it was heart-breaking for my whole family. “I had the back third of my tongue removed and reconstructed by joining the gum across to reconnect to my tongue, my speech was slightly affected by this so I worked with speech therapy to get full range of my speech back.“During surgery this included a neck dissection to remove the spread tumour and all of my lymph nodes on the left half of my neck. The tumour was aggressive so it was followed up by radiotherapy. “I was re-diagnosed in April . My tongue had visually changed due to the radiotherapy scarring but had got sorer and made my diet increasingly limited over time. By March  I was due my clinic review, but one particular area was so sore I couldn’t even eat and every meal by this point had become painful because of the severe soreness. “The second diagnosis wasn’t altogether a shock, I was already aware my tongue cells were changing because of how sore it was.  “During the wait between the same biopsy scans process and results I tried to stay optimistic, which was a challenge as the ‘vulnerable persons self-isolation’ had been introduced to keep myself safe from COVID-. “With all of this happening I was more distressed as by this point I was also starting to struggle eating because with the soreness where the mutation was. Once confirmed I was naturally upset but I then had to make the decision to go ahead with the operation which would happen during the peak of COVID-.  “I’m generally a very optimistic positive person and try to handle my health the best I can through the challenging times, but even with that mindset there’s only so much a person can take of these le experiences. “Since the first tongue tumour I’ve had upsetting flashbacks and many memories that still come back.” The most common type of head and neck cancer is squamous cell carcinoma and about nine out of  head and neck cancers start in squamous cells. Kimberley isn’t sure why she has been diagnosed with tongue cancer on two separate occasions or why she developed it so young. After genetic testing, her doctors concluded that her genetics are very rare and prone to mutation.  After surgeries Kimberley has been left with ten inch scar from left to right which is formed of two separate six inch scars overlapping. “I’ve always wanted to share my story to inspire others in any way possible,” she said. “But now after another diagnosis I want to use the small public  I created to hopefully bring more awareness and share information footage pictures that can help people understand what cancer journeys are like - they’re all inidual but each diagnosis follows a similar process and I want to share things others wouldn’t know or understand properly unless experienced in some way personally. “I want to inspire others and say whatever challenge you come across, things will always move on so you have to make the most of every moment you can and enjoy the best out of things even in dficult times or with lestyle adaptions.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/c7768f9f-46f2-4652-97ea-89a50937e3b6-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/c7768f9f-46f2-4652-97ea-89a50937e3b6-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/c7768f9f-46f2-4652-97ea-89a50937e3b6-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/c7768f9f-46f2-4652-97ea-89a50937e3b6-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee city council issue advice to people shielding across the city","story":"Dundee City Council is offering advice to those who have been shielding across the city during lockdown and receiving deliveries of food.Just under , people in Dundee have been receiving grocery boxes from the Scottish Government as they were unable to access alternative local support whilst shielding.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced earlier today that from tomorrow, those who have been shielding will be able to visit shops, go to outdoor bars and restaurants and meet with people from up to two households indoors whilst socially distanced .The national food box scheme will make its last deliveries on July .Over the next few days council staff will be contacting those who have been receiving the grocery boxes to make them aware of the changes and advice will be given on how to make alternative arrangements.Leader of Dundee City Council, John Alexander, said: #The past few months have been dficult for everyone, but they have been particularly challenging for those who have been shielding.#Thanks to the efforts that we have all made to prevent the spread of Coronavirus, the advice now is that those who have been shielding can go out more, including trips to the shops from tomorrow.#That means the majority of people who have been shielding will be able to make their own arrangements to get food, as well as other essentials such as medicines.#Those who have been shielding have been able to register for priority slots with local supermarkets. There is still time to register for this but it must be booked before July .He added: #We know that some will continue to have anxieties, whether these be about going out for the first time in months, or simply finding the money to pay for essentials.#Our staff will be in contact with everyone who has been in receipt of a food box to discuss their inidual circumstances.#The city has come together so well to support those in need through this crisis, and that will continue.

The season before last I had my hip surgery and missed the whole year, but last season I was fully fit for the whole season.“I got a run of games which was good and the next thing is I just need to maintain that myself and stay ready for whatever challenge is next.”Though he’s open to joining another side on these shores, the challenge for the Scottish Cup winner could be his first senior club in his home country.“I will not rule out anything north of the border. I would love an opportunity in England, of course, I have always said that,” he said.“When I first went up there at the start I was always of the mindset that I would like to have an opportunity in England just to see how I would go and what I could do.”Meekings’ decision to leave Dundee centred on his young family and, despite some online criticism surrounding his departure, he thanked the club’s fans for messages of support.#Unfortunately it is part of social media nowadays. I#ve always said it gives people a license to write what they want behind a screen,# he said of negative comments.#A lot of the fans have been positive and have been thankful and thoughtful with their comments afterwards as they understand the time that we are in. They have wished me well and I wish Dundee all the best for the future.#I thank the fans for their support over the last few seasons and I was honoured to be the captain of the club.#It wasn#t an easy decision to have to make but it was one I had to do purely on the decision of my family and that is the way that things have to be now.#He added: #I had every intention of staying had it been slightly dferent. But with the club having to make cuts – they have let go of Jimmy Nicholl the assistant manager, Cammy McDermid the sports scientist – there is cuts being made and I can completely understand that.#The football club needs to survive and Dundee put themselves first in looking after themselves which is completely respectful in the same way as I need to put my family first when it comes to making the decision about my le and our lives.#I think that anyone who thinks about it properly will understand and respect the decision I#ve made.

So,he’s only bringing in two or three new players, they have to work. Fair enough, take time to get it right but he needs to add some quality to the squad.Whether or not that happens, there are a number of players in the squad who will need to step up and play their part in the new season.As I said before, there are question marks across the squad but I also feel players like Jamie Robson and Liam Smith are types who could flourish in the top flight and excel.I’m looking forward to seeing how Louis Appere does with the step up in quality, too.You’ve also got players like Mark Reynolds and Nicky Clark who obviously have quality but are maybe the wrong side of .You need to find the right balance and, looking at the squad, it just feels a bit off right now.There have been a few niggles in pre-season to key players – keeping them fit will be massive because clearly to be successful, United will need Lawrence Shankland, Calum Butcher and Benjamin Siegrist to be fit and firing, no doubt.There is a lot to be positive about the squad at Tannadice after last season but I can’t help but think they will struggle in the top flight without some help.It was a surprise to see Andrew Nelson leave Dundee on Friday.I don’t know the story behind his departure but he’s the type of player I think needs the stability of being at one club for a few years.And I would have liked to have seen that happen for him at Dens Park.Because it is a gamble for a player his age to go looking for a new club.Nelson would no doubt have plenty of chances in James McPake’s first team next season.With finances at the club the way they are, bringing in lots of new players is unlikely.I’d expect the squad next campaign to be a tight one and that spells opportunity for a player like Nelson.The way he started out at Dundee with some big goals in the Premiership, there was a chance to be a success at the Dark Blues.It’s a shame the way it’s all ended for him and the club with the overall situation right now but I guess he feels like it was time to move on.A chance missed for both.The arbritration looking at Hearts and Partick Thistle’s relegation has begun and obviously may have an impact on Dundee United.All this should have been done and dusted, though – the new season kicks off in  days!It’s sad that it has come to this and clubs need to be defending themselves against other clubs.If there was proper leadership from the SPFL and they took control of things from the start we wouldn’t need this.After watching the FA Cup semi-finals at the weekend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a big decision to make at Man U.Following another big blunder, can he afford to stick with David De Gea or drop him tomorrow LEE WILKIE: Micky Mellon less of a gamble for Dundee United than Steve McClaren\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Micky Mellon less of a gamble for Dundee United than Steve McClaren# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-micky-mellon-less-of-a-gamble-for-dundee-united-than-steve-mcclaren embed # secretWnjibuTys\" data-secret\"WnjibuTys\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

those on the waiting list.Aberdeenshire Council#s communities committee agreed in March that a possible move to a web-based system should be used to allow housing applicants to view properties and information about features and rent online and apply or ‘bid’ for a home.The council is holding virtual information sessions as part of its consultation process and they will be held on Wednesday, July  at pm and Tuesday, August  at am.The events will be recorded and made available on the council website for those unable to join the sessions.Communities Committee chairwoman councillor Anne

views on the new document before it is finalised.“The possible change in approach to the way properties are allocated is an important part of this process, so we want to be comfortable it is the right

aberdeen amusement park over wrong advice being given out","story":"The Scottish Government apologised to an Aberdeen amusement park for giving them wrong advice over when they can open.Codonas were originally told that they would be able to start up again on July  but were told to close down again days later.This was due to them being considered in the same category as a travelling funfair, with the park being forced to close its outdoor rides.The boss of Codonas called that decision “astounding” and warned that up to  jobs were at risk.Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop was asked about this issue at today’s coronavirus daily briefing and said it was “unfortunate and regrettable” that conflicting advice had been given out.She added: “We will move to reopen Scotland’s funfairs when it is safe to do so.“Unfortunately, there had been conflicting advice issued. The regulations are quite clear about a specic reference to funfairs and they are not able to open at this stage.”The Scottish Government said that funfairs may have been considered as visitor attractions but regulations had a clear definition for them.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/07/865017-1.jpg ","title":"former aberdeen and dundee united player mark perry delighted by return of new firm derby","story":"As someone who starred for both sides, Mark Perry is relishing theof the New Firm derby.After four years away, Dundee United are back in the top flight and can resume their rivalry with Aberdeen.The first Premiership clash between the sides since March  is pencilled in for October .Perry was with the Tangerines from - before making the move to join the Dons and spent two-and-a-half years playing for his boyhood club.The former defender believes theof this heavyweight tussle is good news for the two clubs and Scotland’s top flight.The -year-old said: “It was a fixture that was always great to play in as a player.“When I was at United, coming up to the Pittodrie as the opposing team it was always tough, but great games to be involved in.“There were quite a few memorable games when I played - draws and - and - wins.“There’s a - win at Tannadice that sticks out which was one of my favourite games and that was for United against Aberdeen.“I’m an Aberdeen supporter and I have been from a young age, so when I was at United it was good to come up and play at Pittodrie in those New Firm games.“It’s great that these games are back, it’s a good fixture for both clubs and the Premiership in Scotland needs games like these.“They’re good spectacles and that’s something Scottish football needs after how it’s been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.”When he played in the fixture Perry tended to have more success with Dundee United than he did Aberdeen.He played for the Tangerines as they thumped the Reds - in January  and - in November of that year # although his last involvement in the fixture was a memorable - win for Aberdeen at Tannadice in September .However, as a lelong Dons fan, was it strange playing against them and beating them Perry added: “It wasn’t strange. I’ve supported Aberdeen all my career, but at that time I was a United player, so it was just another game and coming to Pittodrie was just another away game.“It was always special playing at Pittodrie because I had friends and family who were all Dons fans coming to the game, but you just treat it as another game.“Then when I joined Aberdeen and we were playing United at Tannadice, I just had to treat that as another away game going back to my old club.“I’ve got good memories of both clubs, in terms of the fixture I maybe had better luck with United.“Playing for Aberdeen and scoring at Pittodrie was great, but maybe things didn’t quite go as I might have hoped.“But when things are going well Aberdeen is a great club to play for and I was lucky to play for Aberdeen and Dundee United.”Perry believes this season Aberdeen will start as favourites in the matches against their newly-promoted opponents.United’s Premiership preparations were also disrupted by Robbie Neilson ing to manage Hearts, with Micky Mellon brought to Tannadice as his replacement.Perry said: “Aberdeen have established themselves in the Premiership over recent years as a consistent side finishing second and third most seasons and will start favourites for the games.“Dundee United are coming up and, although Robbie Neilson has left, I think he’s put a good team together and I’m sure the new manager Micky Mellon will do well.“He seems to have a good reputation down in England and I’m sure he’ll be looking to bring in a few signings as well.“Dundee United also have Lawrence Shankland, who is a very good goalscorer and I didn’t realise how good he was until I saw him more regularly for United and Scotland last season.”Perry also recalled a memorable incident surrounding his eventual move to Aberdeen in the summer of .On the eve of a New Firm Scottish Cup tie in January of that year, Evening Express sports editor Charlie Allan reported Perry was ready to turn down a new contract with United and join the Dons at the end of the season.Furious Tannadice manager Tommy McLean subsequently banned Allan with the EE printing facemasks of the scribe, who retired in , which the Red Army wore in the away end.Perry said: “Charlie got himself in trouble with Tommy McLean and got himself banned from Tannadice for a while.“But I think the fans more than made up for it by wearing Charlie Allan masks – it wasn’t a very good sight, but there you go!“It was quite strange coming out that day and seeing a few thousand Charlies there.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"wealth of shinty pictures uncovered in furnace","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsA treasure trove of old shinty photos has been unearthed in Furnace after lying in a suitcase for decades.The photograph collection belonged to former Furnace and Lochfyneside player, the late Niven #Bunty# Crawford, and turned up earlier this month when his daughter Christine Crawford was having a lockdown clearout.Christine#s nephew and Bunty Crawford#s grandson Scott Robertson told the Advertiser his grandfather#s story.Bunty Crawford was born and raised in Minard.Just before the Second World War he was taking a course at Glasgow University School of Art # and was in demand as a shinty player.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and the outer rim of the p piece is obscured, the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

lookthey can,they have clear skies, and get away from light pollutionthey can.How and when can I see the comet Comet Neowise reaches its closest point to the earth tomorrow morning around  minutes before sunrise - at around .am.One easy way to spot the comet is to look for the Big Dipper- which should be visible eastwards on a clear night with little light pollution.Neowise should be below the Big Dipper, about  degrees above the horizon.What has NASA said A Nasa spokesman said: ldquoA comet has suddenly become visible to the unaided eye.ldquoComet C  Fwas discovered in late March and brightened as it reached its closest approach to the sun, inside the orbit of Mercury, late last week.ldquoThe interplanetary iceberg survived solar heating, so far, and is now becoming closer to the Earth as it starts its long trek back to the outer Solar System.\"NASA also provided their own three tips to seeing Neowise:Find a spot away from city lights with an unobstructed view of the skyJust after sunset, look below the Big Dipper in the northwest skyIf you have them, bring binoculars or a small telescope to get the best views of this dazzling

He would arrive for a few months in the summer, then vanish until the following year.He was always mysterious as to where he came from and where he was going. He had an accent that some said was Irish, but it was mixed with a most definite local Scots dialect. He was an old man with an unkempt beard. He always wore a bonnet a certain way, and wild strands of white hair grew from the sides of it. While he still had most of his teeth, there was one visibly missing, which was revealed when he smiled. When people asked him his name he would be reluctant to say. People called him the Porridge Maker.His most treasured possession was his cooking pot. It was large and heavy and he would carry it on his back with the help of straps he had made. He tied the lid tightly and all his other possessions would be stored in the pot. It became a kind of rucksack as he travelled.He would walk for miles, humming to himself, singing and sometimes playing his penny whistle. Then he would choose a place to settle for the night, and unpack his pot, and start cooking. He would make an evening broth from whatever he had managed to acquire during his dayrsquos travel. Then under the canopy of the stars, or under the boughs of a treeit was raining, he would wrap himself up in the thick blanket that he used during the day as a kind of jacket.Every morning he would make porridge, and always a larger amount than he would need himself. This was the time when people would enquire as to his purpose and origins. Often it was the small children of the village whose curiosity would make them assemble round him and ask questions. Sometimes they would be shooed away by their parents, but often the older members of the community who had more time would engage him in conversation, and then sit with him.The Porridge Maker had tales and riddles, news from far-flung lands and memories of past deeds and events which made his company fascinating for old and young alike. Soon it became apparent why he would make more porridge than he needed: it was to share. He would share it from his one bowl, which he called his Porridge Quaich. It would be passed round in an almost religious ceremony.But to have a taste of his delicious porridge, a price had to be paid. A story or riddle must be told, a memory shared or some wisdom imparted. The Porridge Maker would listen carefully to everything said. This was one way he gained his vast knowledge of the world and of its stories.The other was, of course, in his travels. As he walked he would observe everything: the way the clouds formed, the song of the birds, the landscape and its curiosities, the way people behaved everything. Then he would just be, and allow his thoughts and observations to mingle. This was how new tales and riddles formed in his imagination.And so as he cooked his evening meal, he would tell stories to himself and whisper his riddles, and he would look forward to sharing them with whoever might come his way and sit by his fire.Then one day, someone recognised him.The Porridge Maker had settled himself away from the road by the River Tyne, downstream from Haddington. He had made a small fire and was cooking a trout he had secretly caught when an old man of similar age walked by, stopped, stared at him, and then made his way towards him.The Porridge Maker thought he was now in trouble. But the old man wasnrsquot interested in the fish. He studied the Porridge Makerrsquos features carefully, then he nodded with a grin.ldquoAye, sae it is ye! said the man with an accusing tone.ldquoAye, fir sure I am maist certainly me! replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYe cannae bamboozle me, said the stranger with a triumphant mocking laughter, ldquoI thocht I kent ye by the way ye wear yer bonnet and by yer stooped shudder, but noo that Irsquove seen yer face I ken fir sure!ldquoAnd  asked the Porridge Maker, seemingly unfazed by this sudden attempt to unmask his identity.The stranger sat himself down and looked the Porridge Maker in the eye.ldquoI cannae mind yer exact name, he said, ldquobut I ken ye were a Jacobite.ldquoThose days are lang past noo, said the Porridge Maker, still keeping his calm.ldquoAye, they are, thankfully. And they hanged many orsquo the likes orsquo ye.ldquoThat they did, replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYer a MacGregor, said the old man, ldquoI mind that, and ye hud blood oan yer haunds ater Prestonpans.The Porridge Maker said nothing. He just stared into his fire.ldquoYe sliced a manrsquos heid in twa by the wall.Suddenly the Porridge Maker looked up. ldquoHowrsquod ye ken that  he asked, now startled.ldquoBecause I wis there!The Porridge Maker now looked the man in the eye.The old man continued: ldquoYe were goanie dae the same tae me. I hud nae weapon sae I punched ye.ldquoAye, said the Porridge Maker, ldquoI remember that weel enough, revealing the gap in his teeth that was the result.The old man laughed.ldquoThat punch saved ma le, said the old man, ldquofir it gied me time tae run as ye stood like a stunned rabbit. But I saw ye ater, greetin like a bairn.The Porridge Maker was silent but pursed his lips and nodded.ldquoYe cudnae thole it cud ye  said the man accusingly.ldquoI wis a lad, and arsquo fired up with rage, said the Porridge Maker. ldquoHe wisnae the only one that day I killt. But I vowed he wud be the last Irsquod kill tae decorate anotherrsquos pride. He hud cried fir mercy sayin he had bairns, but I didnae understand his words till after Irsquod cut him.The old man laughed. ldquoSae much fir the great warrior race! Ye deserted after the battle, didnrsquot ye  Ye ran awa like a coward and cudnae gang hame. If the Redcoats hadnae caught ye, yer ain family wud huv disowned ye fir the coward that ye are!ldquoI did go hame after, but I found ma hoose burnt and ma we and bairns slain.

But the wages orsquo rebellion are unforgiving.ldquoDae ye ken the name orsquo the lad that I killt by ye  asked the Porridge Maker hopefully.The man was surprised by the question, and looked at the ground as he thought.ldquoWull I think, aye, it wis Wull. I mind he wis really feart, poor lad, he carsquod fir his mither as he died.The Porridge Maker lowered his head, reliving that moment he had tried so often to forget.Neither men had yet exchanged their names.ldquoYou hungry  asked the Porridge Maker, ldquofor ye can share whit I have ye huv earned it by sharing yer memory wi me.And so two men, who once had tried to kill each other, now shared a meal.ldquoWull, the Porridge Maker whispered as he ate.He finally had a name for the young lad hersquod slain all those years ago in  at Prestonpans.The deepest wounds of war are often those unseen, and the stories left out by military historians are the stories of lives traumatised and changed forever.Sadly, whatrsquos left of the Prestonpans battlefield site is now under threat by proposed new developments."},{"url":null,"title":"column-heyday-open-air-pools","story":"Open-air pool lidos in England are already open.If we were back in our former holiday heyday, we could offer a choice of three seaside lidos.Swimming lsquopondsrsquo at Port Seton, Dunbar and North Berwick once buzzed with summer sociability in the sun.For families, they offered entertainment, like galas, ing displays, water polo matches and midnight bathing.A fortnightrsquos lsquobucket-and-spadersquo seaside holiday drove the popularity of lidos between the wars.

theplanned changes would not only affect the historic interest of the listed building but would adversely affect the setting of the adjacent listed building and be ldquodetrimental to the character

Councilrsquos Local Review Body that the property was for commercial use and should remain so.They said that the council had received  letters of objection and seven in support of the plans, although they added that five of the supporting letters came from people who did not live in the town and they dismissed suggestions the new owners had ldquorobustly marketed the property for its intended purpose before applying to build the house.The new application proposes demolishing the bank hall, which had been described by some councillors at the Local Review Body meeting in November as ldquounattractive as they refused the original plans.It also proposes to set aside part of the ground floor of the new two-storey home for commercial purposes.In an application to the planning authority, the applicants say that the new home would include  square metres of space for ldquoflexible pop-up commercial business space to be rented short term to inidualsor companies requiring to

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and,the outer rim of the p piece is obscured the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-school-return-child-psychologist-reveals-three-top-tips","story":"Schools across the country are set to open from August , with scientic advice published by the Scottish Government last week saying pupils should not have to physically distance when they go back.Face coverings should not generally be needed but staff should stay two metres away from children and other staff where possible.Despite the welcome , a leading teaching union has warned ofthe emotional trauma for children ing to school after a prolonged period off, and said a phasedwould be lsquovitalrsquo for their wellbeing.Alison Murphy, Secretary of the Edinburgh Educational Institute of Scotland local association, said: ldquoChildren will need to be run through lsquoThis is where you wash your handsrsquo, lsquoThis is your bit of the playgroundrsquo, lsquoThis is how the one-way system worksrsquo and so on.ldquoYou wonrsquot be able to do that per cent of pupils are in the building on the first day.ldquoIt would be chaos - it wouldnrsquot be safe.ldquoAnd therersquos the emotional trauma - theyrsquove been away from school for months.ldquoAn adult who had been off work for four months would be entitled to a phasedand for good reasons.Schools have been closed as a result of the virusThe online tutoring service MyTutor has enlisted the advice ofDr. Shreena Ghelani ndash a senior clinical psychologist ndash about how to handle theto school.Here are her three tips:Managing worry and anxietyIf you know your child might struggle with going back to school, try developing a mental toolbox of things they can do when they are worried at school.This might include a song to sing to themselves, visualising a calm place, practising breathing techniques and identying safe staff they can tellthey begin to feel nervous during the day.Speak to your children about the impact of CoronavirusLet children know that it is likely that other families may have been impacted by the virus,whether thatrsquos keyworking parents working hard, or family bereavements.Encourage your child to be patient and kindto other children.Let you child know what they might still be expected to do ndash not hug friends, wash their hands more often, or not share toys.Donrsquot rush to get back to normal too quicklyWhen school restarts in your area, you may find that children are more tired than usual by the extra demands and sensory stimulation placed on them.Ease them back in to their routine gently and allow enough space and time in a new schedule for any hiccups so that yoursquore not having to manage too many demands.When the time comes, yoursquoll find yoursquoll feel less stressedyou know there will be bumps in the road.You can find more tips and online tutoring at MyTutor."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-parking-north-berwicks-elcho-green-put-hold","story":"East Lothian Council announced several temporary changes to the town centre last week as part of its lsquoSpaces for Peoplersquo initiative, which aims to revive towns while helping people socially distance to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Among the changes was the temporary creation of long-stay car parking spaces on North Berwicks famous Elcho Green, which overlooks the iconic West Bay.The announcement of the plans for the car park has outraged many residents in the town, who have shared their objections through a petition set up on Saturday evening in opposition to the plans.

the day.One suggestion was to give all of those in the royal court a goodie bag and rename the event, so instead it held what it called lsquoLockdown Gala Dayrsquo.Graeme Hutchison, gala convenor, told the Courier: ldquoThis was to encourage the kids and remind them that we hadnrsquot forgotten that this should have been their special day.ldquoThis idea kind of grew thanks to our chairperson Vikki Burns suggesting we could have an alternative gala day parade.The parade consisted of the gala committee members decorating their cars with balloons and bows in gala colours.They then travelled around Prestonpans, stopping at the houses of each member of the royal court to deliver them their goodie bag, honking their horns as they passed.Graeme said: ldquoIn the lead-up to gala day there was still a buzz about the town people were still showing their support by putting up their bunting and the parents of the royal court were being made aware we would be visiting. Nobody knew what to expect.ldquoGala day itself was amazing, from the glorious weather to the great response we got from the locals as we travelled around in convoy tooting and waving, visiting many streets of the town which the normal gala parade doesnrsquot visit.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

spin-offs from the  film of the same name - we have followed the two loveable rogues as they get themselves into all sorts of sticky situations.Particularly memorable storylines include the teenagers attempt to steal a giant tuna fish from the market in series one, and when they got expelled after stripping off in the classroom and peeing on Principal Walshs leg in series two.Now were getting a series three, in which we see the lads trying to make their way as young adults, with yet more questionable methods of making some money, all while Jock navigates being a new dad.One things for sure things wont go smoothly.Here, we chat to Walley and Murphy, plus Hilary Rose - who plays Conors stressed-out but loving mum, Mairead - to find out more.NEW CHAPTERIts an unconventional family set-up in The Young Offenders, which is set and filmed in Cork.A heart-warming episode in series one saw widower Maireadbecome a foster mum to Jock - whose mum is also dead - after he escapes his abusive, alcoholic dad.At the end of series two, Jocks girlfriend Siobhan - whose dad happens to be Principal Walsh, who is far from the biggest fan of Jock and Conor - gave birth to baby Star .The new addition to the family means Principal Walsh and his we Orla - whose other daughter Linda is going out with Conor - now have to engage more with Mairead, which hasnt always gone well in the past.\"Season three was interesting from a character point of view because Mairead really cuts loose and, at some stages, the lads are telling her to calm down!\" follows Rose, whos also from Cork, and married Peter Foott -

In one sense, everyonersquos property is off limits without permission, as it is anywhere . Unless, that is, yoursquore an apple-scrumping child ndash and which of us has never been  At this stage of le a garden with fruit trees is excellent training for a career in the SAS ndash get in, achieve mission and scarper without trace or casualties. Part of the allure of these raids, as I recall, is not just the trepidation of trespassing, but of taking forbidden fruit. Usually we gathered the unripe apples and stone-hard pears as ammunition for our long-running battles, rather than as a source of vitamin C. If kids ever clamber over the fence for our apples, theyrsquod be more than welcome. If they could also pick the crab apples and turn them into jam that would be appreciated.Many aspects of le are very dferent this summer from last, but one thing has not changed. Regardless of the lurgy, fruit is ripening fast on bushes and trees the high season of berries is upon us. One of the most vivid memories of our first August here was sitting in a friendrsquos summerhouse and suddenly seeing three folk emerging from the far end of their garden. Each was clutching a bowl heaped with jewel-like fruits, and as they passed it was aswersquod glimpsed the three Magi.A few days ago, we were invited into the same garden, to help ourselves to raspberries. It had been a day of torrential rain, with intermittent sun. The sky was darkening as we made our way between the rows, which were heavy with fat sweet rasps. When the rain began, I put up my hood, and picked on. The scent of wet leaves and trodden earth was intoxicating, a bouquet richer than a Barola. These bushes had been growing here long before our friends arrived,  years ago. They are kept company by apple and pear trees, redcurrant bushes, and plums that, when ripe, hang from the branches like ear-rings. Therersquos also a large bed of still-ripening strawberries. One year I watched a mouse, on tiptoe, nibbling a dangling berry.Irsquove rarely tasted better raspberries than the ones we collected, their flavour enhanced by the atmosphere of the garden where they grew. Being allowed access to this most beautul, out of the way corner reminds me a little of The Secret Garden. That book that made such an impression on me as a girl that I drove my parents nuts begging to be allowed to buy a derelict Victorian walled garden close by. I would climb onto the seat by the bus stop to look over its wall and plan how Irsquod clear it of weeds and shattered glass house and fill it with vegetables and flowers. Since Irsquod shown no desire to lt so much as a dandelion in our own back yard, I was told to dream on.The garden where we, and others, are invited to forage is a perfect complement to the fields and hills beyond. Flowerbeds, graceful trees and a croquet-style lawn coexist seamlessly with fruit and, previously, rows of vegetables too. When people picture the rural idyll, itrsquos often a rose-festooned house where hollyhocks run amok. Yet the true cottage garden was never chocolate-box pretty but a place where leeks and cabbages grew among primroses and poppies ndash more Mr McGregor than Vita Sackville-West. That is still the case. In one of my favourite Hoolet gardens, a formal square bed of roses encloses a profusion of succulent young lettuces, ready to lt for lunch.This is an artful nod to where all such cultivation began. Originally, humble countryside plots were essential sources of food there was no room for unproductive and time-consuming grass, or patios where clematis and wisteria rambled towards dormer windows, choking the gutters. Wholly utilitarian, they contained rectangular beds devoted to cabbages and potatoes and, weather permitting, caned trellises for fruit. These were beautul in their own way, but it was only when flowers escaped from hedgerows and colonised the margins and spaces between the plots that they gained nostalgic postcard charm.The plant collector, Major Lawrence Johnston, is responsible for redefining the cottage garden. In the early th century, when he and his mother moved into Hidcote Manor in the Cotswolds, he took the idea of a rural plot, edited its contents, and scaled it up. The result, with winding paths, artistic focal points, and teeming, colourful borders, had the appearance of being haphazard, random and accidental, when in fact it was rigorously planned. It sounds spectacular. Increasingly, though, Irsquom coming to think that outdoor spaces designed solely to please the eye are lacking in one vital ingredient: the kind you can put on a plate.Thanks in part to the generosity of neighbours, we too are starting to feed ourselves: redcurrants and blackcurrants, strawberries ndash still in relative infancy ndash rhubarb, carrots and herbs. Wersquore not in the league of those who can nurture asparagus Irsquom told it takes seven years for a first crop to appear. In fact, wersquore not in any league at all. After Alan dug up last yearrsquos potatoes, I replanted that bed with roses, honeysuckle and lavender. At one point in late spring, these new arrivals were suddenly swamped by a profusion of shaws, as the undetected, button-sized potatoes left buried in the winter sprouted into le. Following a striking display of flowers, we now have an unexpected crop of delicious spuds to keep us going for weeks. The satisfaction of filling your own larder is immense.

Though curiously, none of this Moscow gold ever found its way into my bank account. Perhaps I should head across and demand payment.At any rate, we were told by all news sources yesterday, that involvement of the Russians in the independence referendum was ldquoconfirmed by the report of the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee. The evidence lay in ldquoopen source commentary it said, which was ldquocredible.The UK Government scandalously ignored evidence of similar Russian involvement in the Brexit referendum, said MPs on the committee, because it didnrsquot want to know. Surprise, surprise.But how come the committee was so sure about Russkie meddling in the Indyref, about which the Government also apparently did not want to know  Why was the ldquoopen source commentary ldquoso compelling  After all, such commentary is just what people had been saying in published sources.There was no shortage of ldquoopen source commentary during Brexit from any number of commentators, such as the prolic Carole Cadwalladr in the Observer, who reported that senior Brexiters were in regular contact with Russian diplomats and business interests. Why did the committee disown all that The implication was that the true Indyref smoking gun was in the classied annex to yesterdayrsquos report. According to the former UK National Security Adviser, Sir Mark Lyell Grant, interviewed on BBC World At One, it was ldquowell known that the Russians were ldquoamplying social media messages during the  campaign. Well known by whom The published report refers only to claims about voting irregularities made after the  referendum and designed to discredit the result. It also referred obliquely to newspaper speculation about cybernat ldquoMcBots punting Russian propaganda.It rather looked asthe Labour and Conservative MPs on the committee were only able to agree on one thing: that the Russians were obviously all over the Scottish independence referendum and that the Government should have taken better note.According to the Labour MP, Kevan Jones, at yesterdayrsquos ISC press conference, the UK Government ignored the ldquoflashing lights from  and turned a blind eye to evidence that similar Russian ldquomeddling had occurred in the Brexit referendum in . Perhaps surprisingly, SNP MP Steward Hosie, who is also on the committee, took up the theme with alacrity. He chastised successive UK governments for not acting on known Russian involvement in the Scottish independence referendum: ldquoIt must have been clear that had they looked for similar evidence [in Brexit] it would have been extraordinarythey had not reached the same conclusions.Questioned later about this on BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Hosie said that he was only able to talk about what was in the unredacted report, not the secret annex. Thatrsquos all very well, but it leaves a nasty smell over the entire referendum campaign.I think we can all agree that the UK is ndash as the report put it ndash ldquoa top target for Russian security and intelligence services. But the activities of the IRA, the Internet Research Agency, which is assumed to be the perpetrator of these electoral dirty tricks, are almost incidental to the more serious activities of the Russian state. After all, it is widely assumed to have been conducting assassinations on UK soil using some of the most toxic agents known. This was against former KGB spies Alexander Litvinov and Sergei Skripal. These were terrorist actions and clearly a priority for the UKrsquos intelligence and security forces.But social media influencing is a rather dferent kettle of spooks. What I mainly recall from  were the widespread claims of vote-rigging and dirty tricks, not by the Kremlin but by MI. Many SNP supporters on Twitter believe the Alex Salmond sex case was orchestrated by the UK secret service.If, as the ISC committee recommended yesterday, MI spooks should now be actively investigating and judging social media posts during election campaigns, then yet more mistrust and paranoia will assuredly be the result. Why so sure  Because they are already doing this.It was revealed in  that the Institute for Statecraft, and its protege the Integrity Initiative, funded by the UK Foreign Office, was already battling Vladimir Putinrsquos social media meddling from the improbable location of a disused mill in Fe. The Integrity Initiative is all about countering ldquodisinformation and malign influence from Russia, which increasingly originates online.However, these hapless hacktivists strayed disastrously into domestic politics. The Integrity Initiative had to apologise to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, for retweeting messages suggesting that he was one of Mr Putinrsquos ldquouseful idiots. Itrsquos not clear which of the institutersquos , tweets were alleging this, but we can guess.Ms Cadwalladr had claimed in  that senior members of the Labour Party including Jeremy Corbynrsquos communications director, Seumas Milne, were Russian patsies. ldquoMilnersquos support of Russia is like Faragersquos, she tweeted in December . ldquoTherersquos nothing hidden. Itrsquos completely overt.This is the problem with trying to fight a propaganda war on social media. Even more than conventional spying it is a hall of mirrors. Paranoia feeds paranoia. In calling for the intelligence services to start investigating election campaigns, the ISC committee is asking for something the spooks dearly want to avoid.Take Labourrsquos ldquoNHS for sale dossier, which became a major story in the  General Election campaign.

Police clearly fear a large crowd of admirers will turn up, breaking Covid- guidelines. It would be like Elvis when he passed through Prestwick, but with a blimpish old Etonian in place of a rock and roll prince.Can it really be a year since Mr Johnson stood in a sun-dappled Downing Street and, with a mob of bellowing well-wishers outside the gates, promised to confound ldquothe doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters who said he would not get Brexit done He also promised to make the streets safer, ensure no-one had to wait weeks to see a GP, and tackle the crisis in social care. ldquoNever mind the backstop, said the new Prime Minister using the jargon of the time, ldquothe buck stops here.He certainly tried to fulfil many of those pledges, albeit in unconventional ways. The streets were safer because they were empty. No-one could see a GP because surgeries were closed. As for social care, it had a whole other crisis to worry about. The story of Mr Johnsonrsquos first year in power is inescapably the story of Covid-. Everything  is secondary, even Brexit, crucial as its success, or otherwise, is to the future of the country. Any judgment on his first year in office is necessarily a verdict on how he dealt with the virus crisis.: Remainers need to move on says PMThough Mr Johnson would prefer to wait for the official inquiry, public opinion is way ahead of him. In a poll last week for the Sun on Sunday,  per cent of respondents thought he was doing well in his job, compared to % for Chancellor Rishi Sunak and % for the newly installed Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.The new Commons double act of Johnson and Starmer was in action again yesterday at the last PMQs before the summer recess. These contests have settled down to a familiar routine in which prime ministerial bluster meets lawyerly formality. Neither man will be truly tested until the Commons, like everything , is back to normal, or the ldquonew normal, whatever and whenever that might be.If there is one word which sums up Mr Johnsonrsquos response to the crisis it is ldquoslow. Slow to impose a lockdown. Slow to build up testing capacity. Slow in making sure there was enough personal protective equipment for the front line staff who needed it desperately. Slow to pick up on the crisis in care homes.Since the PM, like the rest of us, was new to the crisis he was given an enormous amount of leeway. Normal business from opposition parties was suspended. The media were onside. He had been an unlucky premier, dreadfully so, but what was political ill fortune when so many people were losing loved ones  Then he fell ill, eventually ending up in intensive care. The shock, and the get well soon messages, were genuine.Whatever goodwill he built up was soon squandered by his refusal to sack his chief aide, Dominic Cummings, for driving to Durham, and beyond, during lockdown. He failed that test of leadership, just as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon neglected to show the door immediately to her chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, on learning of her double lockdown breach. On his way into Number , Mr Johnson said politicians should never forget that the people are the bosses. Well, the people wanted Mr Cummings gone, yet he remains.As for the rest of Mr Johnsonrsquos first year, it was a mixed bag. The proroguing of Parliament and the subsequent defeat in the Supreme Court would be a stain on any PMrsquos reputation.The General Election that followed was a triumph for the party, with hitherto-Labour seats falling to the Conservatives. How much that was due to votersrsquo impatience over Brexit, and how much to then Labour leader Jeremy Corbynrsquos general uselessness, depends on the observer.: Labour will pay damages to whistleblowersThen we come to Scotland, which stands in the same place it did when Mr Johnson became Prime Minister ndash stuck in the middle between the status quo and independence. Scotland has not appeared to figure much in the PMrsquos calculations this past year, though he has had other things on his mind. That is about to change we are told, hence his visit to Scotland today.Thereafter Scotland is to be love bombed by Downing Street, with ministers encouraged to follow the PM north to talk up the benefits of the Union, particularly in the current crisis.This, Mr Johnson believes, will tackle increasing support for independence in the polls and drive it downwards, just in time for the next Scottish Parliament elections. That is the theory, in any case.The reality may be very dferent. Telling Scotland how much better off it is in the Union by talking up how much money has flowed from Westminster suggests those billions are in the form of grants and do not have to be repaid.

This week has given a good example of just how unhinged Scottish politics is about to become. Letrsquos take the Russia Report. At heart, it shows the Tory government is utterly unfit for power. Itrsquos incapable of defending the UK. Not only that but the party is floating on a sea of Russian roubles. Westminster has lain down and let Russian oligarchs use it as a doormat to Britain where they can launder dirty money.Then we come to Brexit. In the reportrsquos wake, we now know the UK Government actively avoided looking at any evidence that Russia interfered in the vote. Thatrsquos not just gob-smacking ndash itrsquos so egregious it would dislocate your entire jaw. What on Earth was the reportrsquos intentionnot to investigate Russian meddling over Europe  It is the \"Russia\" report after all. The giveaway is in the name. What  was it going to investigate  Putinrsquos latest bare-chested poses for the Kremlin Christmas calendar The fish in my fish-tank know Russia had its sticky spooky fingers all over Brexit, particularly when it came to online manipulation and disinformation.The report shows the UK Government to be a cabinet of liars ndash or rather idiots who are bad liars, and think wersquore too stupid to see their lies. Actually, make that lying idiots whorsquod let a hostile foreign power meddle with UK democracy as long as it served its own petty party political ambitions, and helped grters and mountebanks like Boris Johnson get power.Herersquos where the Russia report plays into the growing craziness of Scottish politics, though: the big leak to the press before the publication of the report was that Russia had interfered in the independence referendum. Forget Brexit, put the weight of the report on to Scotland ndash that was clearly Downing Streetrsquos strategy.Evidently, most rational and informed folk accept Russia was trying it on when it came to the  referendum. Why wouldnrsquot it be  But to focus on interference in Scotland and not look into Brexit is nothing but straight up manipulation of intelligence and security.This all shows what way the wind is blowing. With a new Tory unit set up to fight independence, rest assured there will be more stupid dirty tricks. Only a dummy would think otherwise. That means Scottish politics is going to get weird. Downing Street isnrsquot scared to use any cynical ploy.But the craziness isnrsquot all on one side. Far from it. While the independence movement could easily bask in the lunacy of London, saying \"see, this is what we want to save you from\", some elements of the nationalist fringe have decided to don a crazy suit themselves. Support for independence is now the majority position and the SNP is storming the polls as the public responds to coronavirus ndash but why rest on good fortune when you could trash everything Why not hold a rally outside Holyrood, with figures like former SNP MSP George Kerevan, and tell the world that the Yes movement ldquocannot be patient any longer. Why not have speakers say that itrsquos time to ldquostart getting angry  Thatrsquos not going to put off potential Yes voters, surely Why not call for Union Street in Aberdeen to be renamed Independent Street  That doesnrsquot look daft.Why not have an organiser of the nationalist marching group All Under One Banner say that ldquomanaging Covid should run parallel with fighting for independence  Thatrsquos the same marching group where signs denouncing \"Tory scum\" unfurl at rallies. A tactic designed to win over soft unionist voters, Irsquom sure.Why not start talking about Scottish \"freedom\"  Free Scotland from what, actually, is my question  I support independence and itrsquos not because therersquos some colonial army of English occupation in Peebles, itrsquos because I think Scotland can do better on its own than it currently fairs as part of the Westminster system.But it doesnrsquot stop there. Why not start a new political party and use it to drive a wedge between the independence movement  And why not have that new political party, Alliance for Independence, linked to the craziest fringe of the entire Yes movement  A regional AFI organiser was behind the much denounced protest at the border where Yes supporters wore hazmat suits and shouted ldquoplague carriers at visitors crossing from the south.That ought to work. If therersquos anything likely to reach out to a hesitant voter, then this must surely be it. And just for good measure, why not throw Tommy Sheridan into the mix and make sure hersquos involved in this brave new political party too.Done deal. Therersquos no way independence is going to risk any damage from that catalogue of tactical brilliance.The bottom line is this: Boris Johnsonrsquos government is dangerous. It would trash anything and everything for the sake of one objective: raw power. So how is this dangerous government likely to treat Scotland as the independence debate intensies in the coming months  Get ready for a dirty fight, thatrsquos all I can say.Meanwhile in the indy corner, the wild, conspiratorial base is getting out of control, and risks damaging the entire Yes movement with its absurd, juvenile antics. The Yes movement has to get itself in order and keep the extremists in their box. Politics cannot be a matter of \"crazy versus crazy\". The independence movement will only win with reason, openness and persuasion. Anything  is mere posturing, designed to serve the posturer rather than the country or the ideal.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Despite claiming to be united, they canrsquot even agree on the most basic positions.ldquoThe independence movement is now splitting into dferent camps and causing more uncertainty and ision in the process.ldquoItrsquos no wonder Scotlandrsquos domestic agenda has been neglected by the SNP as a result.Scottish Labour MP Ian Murray said: ldquoSenior figures in both the SNP and this breakaway nationalist group are fighting among themselves about how to make next years election all about independence and ision.ldquoThey want next years critical elections to be a referendum on a referendum, or even on declaring independence, when all energy should be on post-covid recovery.\"Just imaginenationalists devoted as much of their energy to saving peoples jobs or protecting our NHS.

Westminster is rotten and corrupt, politics is rotten and corrupt, the social system is rotten and corrupt, but nothing will ever change.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.IN the absence of theatre, at least we are being offered some farce in the British security services Russia Report.Russia is supposed to have pursued a social media campaign on Brexit and independence, and the first joke is why did it bother  Was it so out of touch  The UK public, having been bombarded for years on a daily basis with anti-EU propaganda, hardly needed any additional tweets. The security services should have been investigating those interfering billionaires, Rupert Murdoch, Jonathan Harmsworth, David and Frederick Barclay. These are the men who wield great power through the Sun, Mail, and the , and their propaganda skills are far superior to a few Russians in a back office.In the Scottish independence referendum, almost all the press was extremely hostile and in no way reflected the distribution of opinion among the public. But this was to some extent counter-balanced by the great peoples movement that grew, often on entirely personal initiatives, on the Yes side. They had only social media and personal contact and in their many thousands used it brilliantly. Any foreign interference on social media,it happened, was entirely superfluous. We did, of course, have some foreign interference ndash by President Obama, by Spanish politicians and some senior EU officials.No-one should ever take what any states security services produce at face value. Always assume that it is as likely to be  as true. They all have agendas. They are all engaged in mind games, it is their job. Remember Iraq, anyone  They are all hacking both friends and enemies. They are all pursuing propaganda initiatives. The US was even caught hacking Angela Merkel. So sit back and watch the show.Isobel Lindsay, Biggar.YES, there should be an investigation into interference into the  referendum. What we know is that David Cameron required UK Embassy staff to cajole foreign governments into opposing Scottish independence in . Russia reported at the time that it was one of them, and we saw the Prime Minister of Spain and the President of the United States make speeches to this effect. Irsquom sure Ian Murray and Murdo Fraser will welcome any such inquiry into this iniquity.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I FOUND that Iain Macwhirterrsquos article UKon the report on Russian interference in the sometimes clouded the main point.He jokingly suggests, in the context of the report, that since he was pro-independence for Scotland in  he might have expected some financial recognition from the Kremlin for his written articles. This acknowledges what most reasonably minded people take from the evidence emerging regarding the revelations about alleged Russian interference.I find it obvious that it is in the political interest of Russia to break apart the UK and hence weaken its strategic integral role in the world. The same argument applies to Brexit, as a Europe without the UK suits Russia. If Russia did in fact make any effective dference in the  result it must therefore have been to swell the Yes vote.What I expect has come out of this foul affair is thatthe old adage ldquoyou should not believe everything you read in the newspapers\" holds true, then it is very many times more true when the message is applied to the internet. The UK has a very long history of distrust and conflict with Russia and our alliance during the Second World War was perhaps something to be seen as an unusual blip in history.However, I find it telling that our UK Government, as some reports admit, \"took its eye off the ball in watching out for both dirty tricks from a foreign power and, I suggest, also did the same for the threat of a killer pandemic.Perhaps it is time the Westminster Government took stock of its elected role and remembered punctually in future when to lt the drawbridge.Bill Brown, Milngavie.IT seems that the Russians have been trying to influence voters in the UK by posting fake messages on social media. I do remember some ridiculous nonsense being circulated in the run-up to the  Scottish referendum. It was said that each voter in Scotland would be worth pound,they voted Yes. The figure had been arrived at by taking the estimated value of oil deposits in the North Sea and iding by the number of voters ndash aseach voter could extract the oil themselves. It was such drivel it must have come from a Russian agent.I hope that any inquiry into the distribution of misinformation at that time will uncover the source and also calculate how many people may have been duped into voting Yes by that phoney get-rich-quick fraud.Les Reid, Edinburgh EH.WITH the much-delayed and redacted report into Russian interference in two referendums finally published, I am reminded of our National Bard, who might have said \"We are bought and sold for Russian gold, such a parcel of rogues in a nation\"Alec Oattes, Ayr.Read more: Sturgeon urged to condemn Salmond for being in the pay of the Kremlin"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-decision-make-face-coverings-mandatory-populist-not-scientific-one","story":"The rationale for this argument is  there is no comparison in the scenarios. Seatbelts and vaccines are fully tested and usage policies are based on sound scientic evidence. However, the policy for mandatory usage of \"cloth face masks coverings\" seems to be based on circumstantial assumptions, papers which have not been peer reviewed, but yet are quoted by the media as being factual and definite.This issue appears to be a red herring in the Covid- fight and as Orwell said about Second World War gas masks, \"simply a symbol of national solidarity\". Only N respiratory masks are of any help in the prevention of respiratory disease, as Professor Jason Leitch correctly advised at the start of this crisis. The only thing that has changed is Prof Leitchs advice based on \"some evidence\". However, \"some evidence\" has not been circulated, and there is no consensus across the scientic or global community on this subject, due to the lack of evidence.Its easier to support something when presented with actual evidence and that is the obvious issue here. To date there appears to be only one validated test, which is referenced in this current WHO guidance to healthcare and community workers of June : \"In the context of severe medical mask shortage, face shields may be considered as an alternative. The use of cloth masksas an alternative to medical masks is not considered appropriate for protection of health workers based on limited available evidence. One study that evaluated the use of cloth masks in a health care facility found that health care workers using cotton cloth masks were at increased risk of influenza-like illness compared with those who wore medical masks.\"However, the WHO advice for the public, issued on the same date, recommends that the public should wear them. Why  The WHO was forced by political interference to amend its advice. The WHO has not performed its duty from the start of this outbreak, and that is a huge issue. Its about time that the media took notice of these things and actually gained corroborative evidence instead of jumping on the bandwagon in these desperate times.I believe this to be a political judgment, not a scientic one, done this to try to appear asthey are doing something, and provide someconfidence to the population. The Government would be better to be up front about it. I can understand the pressure politicians are under, but I would preferthey actually \"followed the science\", rather than grasping at populist straws.The only messages that practically matter are ldquodistance, distance, distance, and the critical one which is never mentioned, to get as physically fit as possible, and give yourself the best chance of fighting the terrible virus.Mark Innes, Elgin."},{"url":null,"title":"schools-re-opening-nicola-sturgeons-top-priority-businesses-set-longer-wait","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has warned traders such as gyms and music venues, that are still unable to restart their operation, that ldquoit is possible that we may not be able to make any changes next week except confirming schools can re-open from August  and a pause in shielding guidance from the end of the month.Education Secretary John Swinney will today update MSPs on the Scottish Governmentrsquos plans to re-open schools ndash but Conservatives have called for ministers to formally commit to a full-timeto education today to give teachers and parents enough time to prepare for classrooms being unlocked.Yesterday, the First Minister stressed that the re-opening of schools is top of her governmentrsquos priorities ndash meaning any further relaxation of rules are unlikely to be confirmed over the coming weeks.:Scots warned they cant book a holiday with certainty amid concerns over Spains Covid spikeAhead of Mr Swinney delivering a statement on his schools proposals, concerns from parents over the plans have been published including fears over childcare and worries over the wellbeing and attainment of children.Ms Sturgeon indicated that the current phase of the Scottish Governmentrsquos four-step plan to ease the lockdown is ldquolikely to last considerably longer than the three-week periods earlier phases were subject to ndash meaning gyms and music venues may not even be told a timescale for when they can re-open at the Scottish Governments next lockdown review.The First Minster has indicated that the ldquoreally signicant changes made over the last few weeks, including allowing pubs, restaurants and shops to re-open, means officials need to ldquocarefully monitor the impact and the number of new cases.She added that the call centre outbreak in Lanarkshire illustrates ldquowhat can happen when people are mixing indoors and when perhaps guidance isnrsquot being rigorously followed.:Scottish schools should employ every qualied teacher in the country ahead of schools re-openingMs Sturgeon said: ldquoOur main focus right now, and I think it is a priority that will have widespread agreement across the country, is on keeping the virus at a low enough level to enable schools to fully and safely re-open from August .ldquoIt is possible that we may not be able to make any changes next week beyond confirming theof schooling and a pause in shielding.The First Minister appealed to businesses waiting to re-open in phase four of her blueprint to be patient.She said: ldquoFor those businesses who are still waiting for a date to restart, I want to thank you for your ongoing patience.ldquoI fully understand how dficult any further delay is for you.

Mr W. C. Howard, manager of Argo’s, suggested it at the first meeting of the Stromness and West Mainland Chamber of Commerce, in late June .The best time for it was the third week in July, to coincide with the Kirkwall monthly holiday and the Stromness Regatta, so it was opened by Provost George Robertson on July .Other than during the war, Stromness has always had to work hard to attract business. Provost Robertson said in his opening speech that the aim was “to keep Stromness very definitely on the shopping map” and he told an old Stromness story: “Said a business man to his neighbour, ‘How’s business the day, William ’ ‘Oh,’ replied he, ‘canna compleen, canna compleen – selt a Christian Herald, changed a penny and shawn a man whar the auld kirk is.#”The week was a resounding success. All the shops decorated their windows and offered prizes and discounts. About  flags filled the street, as everyone hung out what they could find. Merriman’s electrical shop, then half-way up Porteous Brae, hooked up loudspeakers to provide music for the passers-by.Even at such short notice, Stromness managed to get the “showies” to ert to the town. There was an amusement arcade in the Transit Shed, at the top of the North Pier, and the side-shows at the Market Green even included chairoplanes.The mystery bus tour was on Tuesday. Provost Robertson had suggested that the tour might take its passengers to “parts of the mainland you have never seen since you were last carted there to a Sunday School picnic ,  or  years ago”. He urged his audience to book but, of course, this didn’t happen and only one bus was laid on. Another five had to be hurriedly brought from Wishart’s Garage.On Wednesday there were sporting competitions at Ness, which culminated in a five-a-side hockey tournament. The men’s final, won by Dounby, was described in the Orkney Herald as being played “with a speed reminiscent of ice-hockey and an enthusiasm to win that might have been more appropriate on the battlefield”.The week also held the Stromness Regatta, a Swimming Gala, a Football Tournament, the County Sheepdog Trials and a Bring and Buy Sale in the North Kirk that raised £.The week ended, as it always has, with a fancy-dress parade. The -yard long procession was led by the Kirkwall City Pipe Band and followed by hundreds of excited spectators.  spectators lined the Market Green for the judging and presentation of prizes.In , the main attraction was the Wick Girls Pipe Band but there was plenty of home- grown entertainment. Nannie Gowans organised a concert by the youth of the town in the Town Hall. When her brother Johnnie was appointed Shopping Week organiser a few years later she ably assisted him. They are still remembered in Stromness for developing a bigger programme of events and bringing in big attractions, such as tightrope walkers, motorcycle display teams and the Globe of Death.There had not been enough time to organise the suggested art exhibition for the first Shopping Week but it was there in , organised by Stanley Cursiter, in the building now occupied by the Ell  Co Café.The Swimming Gala in the harbour included a water-polo match, “…in which it was dficult to know who was playing who” and a display of water-skiing but the big event was the March of Time cavalcade organised by the Young Farmers at the Market Green, showing how farming had developed over the centuries.“First of all came cultivation, beginning with the man with the spade and pick… We saw the genuine old wooden plough of our great-grandfathers…. The lovely and lovable Clydesdales drawing the long-boarded plough and the  tractor carrying its two-furrow at the tail and jogging along with a jaunty air.Sowing, harvesting, threshing and the farmhouse kitchen went through similar progressions, all with a commentary by JGS Flett from Harray. The final scene was the farmer in his feather bed “where he rests amid all possible blessings of State and personal luxury and indulgence.”The week ended with the parade, open air dancing and the first Shopping Week fireworks: a -minute display from the Inner Holm.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

We want to help them keep it up.“These survey results and the enthusiastic response to the Make Space for Nature campaign gives us confidence that Scotland is well placed to reverse the decline in ersity of animal and plant species in Scotland. As the need for nature is ever more apparent, the way Scotland recovers from COVID- could be one important way we secure a nature rich future for generations to come.”SNH is keen to encourage and support people to develop their interest, learn more and get involved in nature.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

Her comments came as the Republic published its so-called green list of  countries from which travellers will not have to quarantine. It does not include Great Britain or the US.Read More Coronavirus quarantine: Your questions answered on confusing Northern Ireland travel regulations A land that#s on both green lists: it has to be Greenland... but would you holiday there Most of the countries on the Ireland list are also on the list of places from where people heading to Northern Ireland do not have to quarantine. There are, however, notable dferences, including France and Spain, which are on our list but not on the Republic#s. Likewise, some appear on the Ireland list but not the UK one, such as Estonia and Slovakia.Ms Gault said the primary concern was how people can get here in the first place, irrespective of quarantine issues.She added that in , the tourism spend was in the region of £billion, with some % generated from domestic, Republic of Ireland and GB visitors. The GB market remains our largest overseas market in terms of spend and numbers, she said. There are, she added, three main questions to consider in terms of attracting visitors from abroad. How can people get to Northern Ireland for a holiday  Ms Gault asked. How happy are visitors to travel  And will the local communities be happy to welcome them  Ms Gault said that Northern Ireland#s hoteliers were concentrating on island of Ireland visitors in the short-term, but they hope that, as the pandemic subsides, visitors from GB and further afield will . Visitors on the island can travel easily by land and are content to do so, she said.Tourists have been widely welcomed by local communities as the R number remains well contained north and south of the border.Moving to those beyond the island of Ireland, perhaps the most pertinent point is that access by air and sea is limited. Research has shown that international visitors, even those from Great Britain, are reticent about travelling to Ireland and appear to be looking at holidaying in .Ms Gault said that Covid clusters cause concern about people coming into communities.She added that the general consensus is that travel is starting to pick up on an all-Ireland basis and visitors from further afield are more likely to travel much later this year but may wait until .Ms Gault said that until leisure and business travel was given the green light, it is dficult to see how we can restore signicant levels of business.There is confusion about travelling, with essential travel abroad deemed as the only travel people should plan, she added. This in itself is leading to concern and having a negative effect on visitor sentiment. Recovery of the tourism industry will be slow.It is important Northern Ireland has access to markets which offer opportunity whilst maintaining control of the spread of Covid-, and that we are open for business once the overseas visitor is happy to travel again.Tourism expert Lyn Fawcett, whose family owned a string of venues on the north coast, said thatNorthern Ireland was not open to GB visitors, it would have a signicant impact on our overall business. About % of my business will be from GB and the rest is domestic, Mr Fawcett explained.At the moment I have people who have booked to come on holiday from England. If they#re forced to go into quarantine, they will not come.The other dimension is that we already have bookings from people from GB and we need to be able to honour those.Mr Fawcett, whose family owned Northern Counties, Fawcetts Royal and The Lismara Hotels in Portrush and The Strand Hotel in Portstewart, said the industry has suffered a setback which will be almost impossible to get over.Losing % of the year#s income for most businesses is a very big hole that has to be filled, he added.If we are closing the doors effectively to a number of countries, that will have a long-term impact. If we don#t get the GB traffic, that will have a major damaging effect on the industry.I don#t think that damage will be so greatit#s from other countries. The former Ulster University hospitality and tourism lecturer, who owns self-catering cottages on the Causeway Coast, said there were positives associated with so many people staycationing in Northern Ireland.There are very few places left in self-catering on the north Antrim coast, he said.People who#ve missed their holidays will probably do so in Northern Ireland and we will continue to be busy into September, October and November.It#s not all doom and gloom. Business is picking up and I#m experiencing a higher level of demand for those three months than I#ve had in previous years - and it#s entirely people from Northern Ireland.Mr Fawcett also said making all US visitors quarantine for  days was using a sledgehammer to crack a very small nut because they could be tested for Covid at the airport upon arrival. He added: You can insist on them bringing negative Covid test results, you can test their temperature at the airport and you can give them a test at the airport and ask them to self-isolate for  hours until the test comes through. Stormont health committee member Colin McGrath said the dfering approved flight lists were confusing.The advice on international travel isn#t clear from the Executive and across the island, so it#s little wonder that people are confused, the SDLP MLA added.

this is a complicated process, that there are ious steps in the process of fit testing – up to, I think, seven steps.“And the majority of staff would have passed elements of the seven but not all

It is expected to report in August . However, to help with cash-flow issues during the Covid- crisis, the Department has already made a substantial interim payment to NMRN.”“The Agreement that the Department had with NMRN to operate the attraction expired on th June.“The NMRN took the decision not to renew this agreement without a revised funding model being put in place and they notied the Department of this on th June.“This did not leave sufficient time for the department to formulate a new funding model, redraft a new operating agreement or to procure a new operator of the attraction.”DfE says it has agreed with NMRN to extend the closure of HMS Caroline until December  and will fully and thoroughly examine all options and costs for its future.It will also meet agreed costs associated with the temporary closure period including the salaries of two staff members who will be maintaining and overseeing the ship during this time.Belfast has been home to the iconic HMS Caroline, a finalist of the  Art Fund Museum of the Year, since .Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcf-ac-aa-bae-_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcf-ac-aa-bae-_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcf-ac-aa-bae-_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcf-ac-aa-bae-_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcf-ac-aa-bae-_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandBattle of Jutland warship’s four years since restoration marked in lockdownA Battle of Jutland warship is set to mark fourth anniversary of its refurbishment in lockdown.Most ReadI#m an MP for everyone, insists Finucane after hostile reception in loyalist areaCoronavirus quarantine: Your questions answered on confusing Northern Ireland travel regulationsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swimming pools to reopen on Friday as ministers given power to enforce wearing of face masksAlf McCreary: Why I feel like a stranger in my own city after first trip to BelfastBelfast City Airport secures six new routes to Great Britain,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The -year-old Irish International Driver of the Year and former Irish Young Driver of the Year touched down on Italian soil on Sunday for the next stage of his rally career. Devine took part in the Junior World Rally Championship in  and last season finished third in a stage of the European Championship in Hungary in the same Hyundai i R car he will be behind the wheel of this weekend. After Tuesdays testing day, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy, spent Wednesday and Thursday carrying out recce of the course and making notes ahead of Fridays shake-down. googletag.cmd.push The event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event which spans just under km. “A lot of effort has been put in by Motorsport Ireland and the Rally Academy to making sure I was here,” Devine told the County Derry Post. “There is the support of Hyundai for me to make a championship assault, so there there is a lot of support being put into it. “It is a big step and I would say it is the biggest year for us. It is going to be our first year and we will be on the back foot. A lot of the drivers we are competing against are in their second or third season and have done this rally a few times.” googletag.cmd.push While Devine sees it as a learning year he realises the need to perform and has set his target to in the Junior R category. “The way it has always worked out in years before,you are fast enough in the juniors you are never that far away from the overall podium. “Chris Ingram, last year, was planning on winning the junior championship and he got beat on it by . of a second in the Czech Republic, he lost the junior championship but he went on to win the full European Championship.” Devine speaks of how the European Championship has lost a lot of momentum to the World Championship, but with Covid- forcing the cancellation of other events it will bring all the big hitters to Italy this weekend. “Craigand a lot of the guys who have been here before, there are lot of quick guys that are going to be going for the main championship. It was probably the strongest year in the European Championship for the last five or six years. There are a lot of quick drivers, but thats what you want,” Devine said. During his World Rally debut in , the Park man had two fourth places and a fth place finish. “We were second in Portugal and we had a DNF . In Corsica, we clipped a back wheel and went down, we were heading for the podium there,” he recalls. “It was one of those years, it didnt click for us. It was a big step, you learn a lot from it. At the time, there wasnt much support and you were left jumping into the unknown into the WRC and how much is involved in it outside of driving of the car, that was the biggest shock but at the same time we enjoyed it. “It was a challenging year and we are now back on the Europeanand are where we want to be.We want to race abroad and see how fast we can be.” Being named International Driver of the Year last season was a big shock for Devine, given the field of drivers in the hunt for the title. Apart from a gravel rally in Fivemiletown earlier this year, the sporting lockdown forced Callum into a dferent type of training. “I have been keeping fit, I got a bike,” he jokes. “I did a bit of running, I was in the forest and bought the bike and doing prep watching on-boards from the rallies and keeping myself fit and active.” He pays tribute to Motorsport Ireland and in particular John Coyne for getting another chance to dine at the top table. “He lives over in the Statesbut he is a great of Irish rallying. They have gave me a lot of help andit wasnt for them, I wouldnt be here.” For Devine, in his usual laid back conservation, its time to steer his way towards a podium spot.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The first threat came in the rise of out of town shopping centres. I can remember the campaigns fought against them in Derry by local city centre retailers who argued it would suck the le out of the city centre. This battle to stop planning being granted for out of town centres was largely lost and we only have to look at Crescent Link to see the impact its had on retail footfall in the city centre. Then we had the advent of online retail which began nibbling at retail sales about  years ago. googletag.cmd.push This nibble has now become a feast. Prior to Covid-, online retail was certainly taking a big chunk out of disposable income. For anyone under  purchasing online from eBay Amazon and using PayPal was as normal as going up the town. Buying clothes, electronics, games etc on your phone for younger people was the norm rather than the exception. With Covid-, however, online retail has reached into every age group. With shops closed and fear of infection particularly amongst older people the rush online has been music to the ears of companies like Amazon. For Derry city, the problem is amplied. googletag.cmd.push Derry suffers from having an already dficult retail situation. We have the highest level of welfare dependency in the North and still rank the highest in any UK deprivation statistics. We also have the highest level of unemployment in the  council areas. This in turn means less disposable income for the local population so retailers have to compete for a smaller amount of money available. Our city centre is beautul but it really needs huge investment made. Carlisle Roadhas a few vacant sites and a number of vacant shops and really could benefit from some redevelopment.  There is a plethora of charity and pound shops which provide valuable employment and services to the most vulnerable but they also tell a story about our city and its spending power.  And when you see a landmark building like the Austin’s Building boarded up and the old Poundstretchers site on Bishop Street still not developed, it really doesnt bode well. And lets not even talk about the view from the Peace Bridge into Foyle Street which shows buildings with weeds growing out the windows. I could go on, but the city centre has been on a slow decline for the last  years and the financial crisis of  has really accelerated it. If there is not urgent action taken now and led by Derry and Strabane District Council, we might not have a city centre in . So how do we reimagine our city centre   Well one thing for sure is the recent announcement by DCSDC that a shortfall in their budget might have to be met with a -year double digits rates increase is not the answer. Such a move, in my opinion, would completely kill business owners operating in the city centre. And remember having a vibrant city centre is what drives tourism. It also drives student numbers. Students and tourists will only come to Derry is it is vibrant and safe. If we allow it to die then we kill tourism. We have to be very careful of what we do in the next  years. So, what could a post Covid- Derry city centre look like  For starters, I think we definitely need more outside space offered to shops and retailers. The whole vibe seems to be al fresco which is driven mainly by the belief that its harder to catch the virus outside. It also helps solve the capacity issue for many pubs restaurants etc. Of course, in continental Europe it rains a lot less but in Holland it rains  days a year and they have a lot more outside space use than us. Ive been to Liverpoola few times and they have as much rain as us but definitely more outside space.  I just hope council dont charge rates for this space. If we want people back to work and businesses generating profits to afford rates, we shouldnt overload their rates bills. I would also seriously look at taking traffic out of the city centre and creating a huge pedestrian zone from the top of Bishop Street straight down to the River Foyle. I would also pedestrianize from the bottom of Carlisle Road right up and including the whole of the Walled City.I would allow a bike lane. Post Covid-, people will want physical distance and what better way to do it than take traffic out all together from the city centre. Data from Living Streets suggests where the pedestrian experience has been improved, footfall has increased between  and %. Bear in mind there has been a % decline in footfall on the high street across the UK between  and . In Leicester for example, shop vacancy rates were five times higher on streets with higher levels of traffic and turnover in pedestrianised areas generally outperforms non pedestrian areas . Bear in mind that a report done by Sustrans titled ‘Bike Le ’ found that % of residents living in  UK citieswere keen to see more space made available on their high streets for people socialising cycling and walking. This was before Covid- and I would guess the % in now higher. Council government really need to look at the whole business rates issue and attempt to rebalance it. Some work is already being done on this and I know the Minister for Finance Connor Murphy is looking to launch something soon. Derry, however, should look at a scheme to encourage new businesses to take up space which includes a rates free period. We need to encourage new businesses to locate into the city centre. Ebrington is another exciting addition to the solution. We can expand the city centre across into Ebrington where there is plenty of outside space. We should also utilise the Guildhall Square on a permanent basis and its a perfect link to Ebrington. We really need to imagine a new city centre with many uses. We need to also develop more markets across the city. Markets bring football and offer small producers a change to sell their products. Covid offers many opportunities as well as challenges. During lockdown we saw a huge increase in the number of people working from home and living locally. Its likely that there will be less commuting to larger towns and cities so people will be spending more time in their immediate local area. Its up to us now to design a new city centre which meets the needs of people. The new high street city centre cant only be about retail. To think this way would be to ignore the clear trends in consumer behaviour and online retail. Sustans, an organisation which has researched this widely, said in a recent report: Re-establishing the role of the high streets as a hub for social connection and reinforcing and celebrating its roots and unique character could go a long way to encourage people to stay local and spend their money where they live. I would go further than that and suggest it could also attract the visitors and students Derry needs to become the vibrant city it aspires too. We need to reimagine our city centre. We have to repurpose large buildings for new uses and also consider housing provision as well. Public spaces like the Guildhall Squareneed remodelling to make more room for meeting, eating and retail.  All of this might mean changing rules in relation to the use of public space and licensing arrangements but we really have to change before our city centre dies. In summary, the current city centre isnt thriving and hasnt for  years. Consumer behaviour, out-of-town retail, online shopping and now Covid- have each had an impact. Its now time to tear the rule book up and imagine the city centre we want for the next  years and the reality is that it will be less about retail and more about making them somewhere where people want to be. It needs to be accessible fun and an exciting development. Lets hope our council appoint the right experts and design team who can hopefully create and enhance our city centre for social and civic use.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We went on a tour of the parish, down all the wee roads and there was a cavalcade of cars coming behind us blaring the horns, it was just brilliant.” Within  years, there was another invasion across the Ballinderry Bridge. Their All-Ireland heroes, clad in matching suits to mark the occasion of their first appearance in an All-Ireland final, paraded behind pipers Michael Conway and the Bell brothers. It was the final leg on the journey from Thurles, where the final was played due to renovations at Croke Park. “Its a long way to Tipperary,” they sang in the fading light, as they followed the hazard lights of their late sponsor Colm Scullions Mercedes Benz up Church Hill. “That was just something ,” Pat beams with pride. Those who know him, he is Ballinderry to the core. *** Rumour has it that goalkeeper Pat McKee first stepped on a pitch at the age of  when he appeared between the posts. Man mountain Gerry McCusker didnt come to prominence until his late teens. “We didnt have the same underage winning teams like the generations that followed,” Pat McGuckin outlines. “I remember us going to recently cut hay fields, about eight or nine of us, and playing for hours. We all turned into decent senior footballers.” The club was formed in  and were champions the following year, but had to wait  years for the next title. “We got to a semi-final in  and threw away a title to Lavey in ,” McGuckin remembers. With  minutes to go, Paddy Chivers long ball was punched to the net by Joe Boyle, helping Lavey to a - to - win. The tables were turned in , with the Shamrocks coming through against Lavey after a replay with a team captained by Sean McIvor and managed by Mick McGuckin, who would become club Chairman the following year. “We were getting better, stronger and more experienced as the years went on,” Pat said. At the turn of the year, there was a new management team in place. His brother Adrian, who was beginning to make his name on the Ulster Colleges MacRory Cup scene with St Patricks Maghera joined Sean McIvor and another experienced player, Malachy Conway, as a management trio. With all three continuing to play, it looked like a dficult situation would arise during the season. “This problem seemed to be solved when Adrian sustained a nasty neck injury during a Larkin Cup game in March. He decided to retire and concentrate on sideline duties,” Pat points out. As the the weeks and months passed and with the championship approaching, Adrian got the bug for playing and it wasnt long until the boots were back on. It coincided with Dessie Ryansfrom New York, where, after a time in construction, he became one of five Irish born members of the Fire Department. Back on Irish soil, he bought a bar in Ballyronan and Adrian McGuckin floated the idea of coming to train the Shamrocks. It was the last part of the puzzle. “It was one of the best bits of work we ever did,” Pat states. “He played a major role in our success at that time and ever since.” While heralded as one of the games greatest every coaches, admired by some of the of the greatest players from all over Ulster, Ryans modesty is striking. “Sometimes you get the credit for what the players do,” stressed Dessie, while repeatedly pointing to the the importance of having people on the pitch who could think on their feet. *** Ballinderrys first championship obstacle of the  season was Magherafelt, who were champions three years earlier. “They were a great team and the game was really tight and it couldve gone either way,” McGuckin states. With time almost up, the sides were deadlocked and Ballinderry won a free to win the game. Having kicked balls off the deck since the age of , Pat McGuckin was Ballinderrys long-range kicker, something he was decent at. Two or three times a game he would trot forward from defence to kick s. Even in this twilight years, on Ballinderry Thirds junior championship winning team of , he burled a handful of points in their semi-final win over Foreglen. A team that included his brother James and future All-Ireland winners Sean Donnelly, Darren Crozier and Fabian Muldoon in their youth. “Theof the kick gets longer in the telling as the years go on,” Pat jokes about the kick that sunk Magherafelt and put Ballinderry on their way. “But...being the modest man that I am, I can definitely say it was from within my own half.” Lurking in the next round was a Kilrea team under the management of Leo ONeill, who were shooting the lights out during the league and the Shamrocks were weary of them. “We knew we had to be at the top of our game to beat them and we did, to setup a semi-final with Glenullin,” Pat continued. Ballinderry navigated the Glen to book their second successive county final berth against Banagher, who they had beaten in the  decider. Going into the game, Ballinderry had their homework done. Banagher were back-boned by hardy defenders Sean McCloskey, Pat and John McCullagh. “They had the flying Mickey Lynch at midfield, with Fintan McCloskey and their captain Alfie Dallas as their standout forwards,” McGuckin remembers. “But we had our own star players and from the experience of the previous year, we went into the game as favourites.”  James, Terence, Pat, Adrian and Mick McGuckin pictured after the  county final. Pat was captain, Adrian is wearing Alfie Dallas swapped Banagher jersey. Mick was club Chairman, after managing the Shamrocks to the  title The game proved to be a long struggle before Ballinderry emerged winners, - to -. It was another passport back into Ulster, where a familiar face awaited them. *** Once again the draw was far from kind. In , Ballinderry had drawn Monaghan giants Scotstown in the preliminary round at home in Shamrock Park. “They gave us an absolute thrashing, I think they beat us by  points or more,” Pat McGuckin remembers with an accuracy that defeat always delivers. “What was the draw for   Yes, it was another preliminary round with Scotstown, this time in Ballybay. They had  county players on their side and were going for a fourth successive Ulster.” The media didnt give Ballinderry a prayer and as Pat admits, who couldve blame them. “Dessie Ryan was not a man to throw in the towel. He analysed video tapes and instilled a belief in our team that we could beat them,” McGuckin stated. Dessie was at the  clash and did watch footage of the Monaghan side, but it was on the pitch where the transformation happened. The players, in his opinion, had belief tucked inside themselves, below the hurt. “Most of my work was done on the field. I always thought the field was a better blackboard than talking in a classroom. “It was the thought process of the players,” he added. “I dont want to take any credit, they probably knew themselves they were not as bad as the first day and they had things to prove to themselves.” Ballinderry turned in a courageous performance right across the board. A -year-old James McGuckin had a stormer in defence, while skyscrapers Gerry McCusker and Sean McIvor were outstanding at midfield. Terence McGuckin, still only , swung frees over from all angles. “Brian Duffin sank an unstoppable shot to the net, late on, to send us home with the most narrowest of victories. It was a victory greeted with as much celebration as our county final win and one which gave us great confidence to proceed in the competition,” McGuckin summed up. Donegal champions Ardara, with young midfielder Anthony Molloy in their ranks, came to Bellaghy for the quarter-final. Goals from brothers Kieran and Kevin Wilkinson put Ballinderry on their way to a comfortable victory. Next up was was Kingscourt Stars in the semi-final back in Bellaghy. “We loved playing there,” Pat admits. “They had a big name at the time, with many Cavan county players. It was a gripping game, which ended up all square thanks to a late Kingscourt equaliser.” Replays always cause scheduling problems, but with the inclement weather things got worse. “It was actually fixed for the Sunday before Christmas, December th my memory serves me right,” said McGuckin. However, with a weekend of snow and frost, the game was postponed until the following February. It gave Dessie Ryan the chance to ramp up the training and preparations. *** Dessie Ryan, while he strongly plays it down, is a legendary figure around Ballinderry, often called into management teams. In his own quiet way, he leaves a stamp on any team. While a thinker, he puts faith in players and their ability to make decisions. “Sometimes I think players themselves are vastly underrated in terms of thinking and that they are just there to play. A lot of success that I have had has came from the players and their thoughts,” Ryan points out. It was something the Ballinderry players had. “They were natural footballers and you dont want to stle anything like that. Of course there are positions you need to keep covered all the time. They had this rapport among them thatone went up the field another would drop back. “If the centre was open, the wing backs would pull towards the middle. Nobody would notice, but it could be the dference in intercepting a pass.” Ryan, now turned , was a running champion in his s and his training regime in the winter before the Kingscourt replay, according to Pat McGuckin, remains in Ballinderry folklore. “My memories are the muck and the clabber,” McGuckin says of those sessions. “The nights were freezing and I remember some of the puddles even frozen over. “Ill never forget one drill of us sprinting in a line across our old muddy pitch. Every time Dessie blew his whistle, we had to e forward before getting up and sprinting on. It was horrible at the time, but it developed character and spirit in the .” Not one of the players complained, Dessie recalls. They just got on with it. “Games are not often called off because of weather, so when you train in those sort of conditions and when the day comes, you are better prepared and you have covered all the eventualities,” Dessie added. “I felt it was a good mind-building exercise, to go to near breaking point and pulling the plug. You cant help but complement them . Thats what counts, you are in it together.” It stood to Ballinderry on their February visit to Kingscourt, as Ballinderry scraped across the line in a - to - and setup a final meeting with a Burren team that would go on to win two All-Irelands and five Ulster titles in the s. With the county scene in full swing, it was a further eight weeks before their April visit to Lurgans Davitt Park for the Ulster final. Burren had Paddy ORourke and the McGovern brothers in their team. At corner forward they had Frank McClorey, better known as UTVs Frank Mitchell. Excitement was at an all-time high on the banks of the Ballinderry river as the game approached. Pat remembers looking out the windows of the bus as they arrived at the ground, seeing some parishioners who had never even been at a Gaelic match before. It was a low-scoring game, with the teams level - each at half-time and defences were very much on top during the second half. “With  minutes to go, we struck for two quick goals in succession from Kieran Wilkinson and John Joe Rocks,” Pat McGuckin added.  The Ballinderry team celebrate the  Ulster club title, after their win over Burren “I was obviously proud to be the first Ballinderry man to accept the Seamus McFerran Cup. The two other lads who enjoyed the same honour - namely Adrian McGuckin junior in  and he played excellently through that campaign. “Connor Nevin was the captain in  and a son of Aidan who was excellent throughout that  success, playing at centre half-forward.” In the changing rooms after the game and with the announcement of the All-Ireland semi-final being fixed for seven days later, with Mayo side Garrymore, celebrations quickly died down. With the quick turnaround, Ballinderry tried in vain to squeeze an extra week to help preparations for their opponents, who were fresh after spending months preparing after their Connacht win. “The game went ahead, as planned, in Bellaghy which was a help. Jameswas our centre half-back and an important cog in our machine. He broke his finger in the first five minutes and had to be replaced. “It disrupted us and the other bits of luck we were enjoying, then deserted us as well. We lost the game by one solitary point and despite not playing at our best, it was a game we couldve won,” Pat admits. In the weeks that followed, the disappointment subsided and Ballinderry began to bask in the the glory of their Ulster title. The following week, a Mickey Niblock inspired Nemo Rangers beat Garrymore fairly handsomely in the final,” Pat continued. Since hanging up the boots, Pat has remained a regular fixture at Shamrock Park. He is completing an unbroken -year spell as club secretary. This would have doubled from ious other stints in the post. Ive enjoyed them all especially the recent term as modern technology has made communication so much easier and I have plenty of spare time,” he concluded. “Like playing, there comes a time to move aside and let a younger member take the reigns...that time is very very soon,but Ill still be knocking about at somethingGod spares me.” The more things change, the more they stay the same. Its in the blood.

It was another passport back into Ulster, where a familiar face awaited them. *** Once again the draw was far from kind. In , Ballinderry had drawn Monaghan giants Scotstown in the preliminary round at home in Shamrock Park. “They gave us an absolute thrashing, I think they beat us by  points or more,” Pat McGuckin remembers with an accuracy that defeat always delivers. “What was the draw for   Yes, it was another preliminary round with Scotstown, this time in Ballybay. They had  county players on their side and were going for a fourth successive Ulster.” The media didnt give Ballinderry a prayer and as Pat admits, who couldve blame them. “Dessie Ryan was not a man to throw in the towel. He analysed video tapes and instilled a belief in our team that we could beat them,” McGuckin stated. Dessie was at the  clash and did watch footage of the Monaghan side, but it was on the pitch where the transformation happened. The players, in his opinion, had belief tucked inside themselves, below the hurt. “Most of my work was done on the field. I always thought the field was a better blackboard than talking in a classroom. “It was the thought process of the players,” he added. “I dont want to take any credit, they probably knew themselves they were not as bad as the first day and they had things to prove to themselves.” Ballinderry turned in a courageous performance right across the board. A -year-old James McGuckin had a stormer in defence, while skyscrapers Gerry McCusker and Sean McIvor were outstanding at midfield. Terence McGuckin, still only , swung frees over from all angles. “Brian Duffin sank an unstoppable shot to the net, late on, to send us home with the most narrowest of victories. It was a victory greeted with as much celebration as our county final win and one which gave us great confidence to proceed in the competition,” McGuckin summed up. Donegal champions Ardara, with young midfielder Anthony Molloy in their ranks, came to Bellaghy for the quarter-final. Goals from brothers Kieran and Kevin Wilkinson put Ballinderry on their way to a comfortable victory. Next up was was Kingscourt Stars in the semi-final back in Bellaghy. “We loved playing there,” Pat admits. “They had a big name at the time, with many Cavan county players. It was a gripping game, which ended up all square thanks to a late Kingscourt equaliser.” Replays always cause scheduling problems, but with the inclement weather things got worse. “It was actually fixed for the Sunday before Christmas, December th my memory serves me right,” said McGuckin. However, with a weekend of snow and frost, the game was postponed until the following February. It gave Dessie Ryan the chance to ramp up the training and preparations. *** Dessie Ryan, while he strongly plays it down, is a legendary figure around Ballinderry, often called into management teams. In his own quiet way, he leaves a stamp on any team. While a thinker, he puts faith in players and their ability to make decisions. “Sometimes I think players themselves are vastly underrated in terms of thinking and that they are just there to play. A lot of success that I have had has came from the players and their thoughts,” Ryan points out. It was something the Ballinderry players had. “They were natural footballers and you dont want to stle anything like that. Of course there are positions you need to keep covered all the time. They had this rapport among them thatone went up the field another would drop back. “If the centre was open, the wing backs would pull towards the middle. Nobody would notice, but it could be the dference in intercepting a pass.” Ryan, now turned , was a running champion in his s and his training regime in the winter before the Kingscourt replay, according to Pat McGuckin, remains in Ballinderry folklore. “My memories are the muck and the clabber,” McGuckin says of those sessions. “The nights were freezing and I remember some of the puddles even frozen over. “Ill never forget one drill of us sprinting in a line across our old muddy pitch. Every time Dessie blew his whistle, we had to e forward before getting up and sprinting on. It was horrible at the time, but it developed character and spirit in the .” Not one of the players complained, Dessie recalls. They just got on with it. “Games are not often called off because of weather, so when you train in those sort of conditions and when the day comes, you are better prepared and you have covered all the eventualities,” Dessie added. “I felt it was a good mind-building exercise, to go to near breaking point and pulling the plug. You cant help but complement them . Thats what counts, you are in it together.” It stood to Ballinderry on their February visit to Kingscourt, as Ballinderry scraped across the line in a - to - and setup a final meeting with a Burren team that would go on to win two All-Irelands and five Ulster titles in the s. With the county scene in full swing, it was a further eight weeks before their April visit to Lurgans Davitt Park for the Ulster final. Burren had Paddy ORourke and the McGovern brothers in their team. At corner forward they had Frank McClorey, better known as UTVs Frank Mitchell. Excitement was at an all-time high on the banks of the Ballinderry river as the game approached. Pat remembers looking out the windows of the bus as they arrived at the ground, seeing some parishioners who had never even been at a Gaelic match before. It was a low-scoring game, with the teams level - each at half-time and defences were very much on top during the second half. “With  minutes to go, we struck for two quick goals in succession from Kieran Wilkinson and John Joe Rocks,” Pat McGuckin added.  The Ballinderry team celebrate the  Ulster club title, after their win over Burren “I was obviously proud to be the first Ballinderry man to accept the Seamus McFerran Cup. The two other lads who enjoyed the same honour - namely Adrian McGuckin junior in  and he played excellently through that campaign. “Connor Nevin was the captain in  and a son of Aidan who was excellent throughout that  success, playing at centre half-forward.” In the changing rooms after the game and with the announcement of the All-Ireland semi-final being fixed for seven days later, with Mayo side Garrymore, celebrations quickly died down. With the quick turnaround, Ballinderry tried in vain to squeeze an extra week to help preparations for their opponents, who were fresh after spending months preparing after their Connacht win. “The game went ahead, as planned, in Bellaghy which was a help. Jameswas our centre half-back and an important cog in our machine. He broke his finger in the first five minutes and had to be replaced. “It disrupted us and the other bits of luck we were enjoying, then deserted us as well. We lost the game by one solitary point and despite not playing at our best, it was a game we couldve won,” Pat admits. In the weeks that followed, the disappointment subsided and Ballinderry began to bask in the the glory of their Ulster title. The following week, a Mickey Niblock inspired Nemo Rangers beat Garrymore fairly handsomely in the final,” Pat continued. Since hanging up the boots, Pat has remained a regular fixture at Shamrock Park. He is completing an unbroken -year spell as club secretary. This would have doubled from ious other stints in the post. Ive enjoyed them all especially the recent term as modern technology has made communication so much easier and I have plenty of spare time,” he concluded. “Like playing, there comes a time to move aside and let a younger member take the reigns...that time is very very soon,but Ill still be knocking about at somethingGod spares me.” The more things change, the more they stay the same. Its in the blood.

Speculation was mounting over the feasibility of the club championships at the weekend, after  clubs suspended their senior activities following positive cases of Covid-. Banagher and Craigbane acted first, on Thursday night, before they were joined by Ardmore, Limavady, Drumsurn, Magilligan, Glack, Foreglen, Claudy and Drum followed suit. Drum have extended their cessation of activities until Monday, July . “This is a matter for the organising committee, in this instance Derry GAA, to manage as they see fit,” said Alan Milton, the GAAs Director of Communications, while also saying it was discussed with counties on a conference call last week. googletag.cmd.push The GAA has ed to games activity on the principle of opt-in added Declan Woods, Ulster GAAs PRO. “Given the uncertainties that exist around Covid-, each county has been asked to draft Competition Rules to deal with potential scenarios.” Derry have indicated that their championships, starting with Saturdays hurling clash of Banagher and Coleraine will go ahead. Games will he played as scheduled,” a Derry board spokesperson told the County Derry Post. With no movement away from the scheduled date anda club cannot fulfill a fixture due to issues surrounding Covid-, the game will be awarded to the opposition team without any further penalty being imposed. googletag.cmd.push Of the  clubs who stood down at the weekend, Banagher were advised one of their members has been confirmed as positive for the virus. It is understood to be a player and the club moved by insisting all their players get tested. “We resume training on Wednesday night,” outlined senior hurling manager John ODwyer. “Only players who come back with a negative test will be permitted to train or to play in Saturdays game with Coleraine.” The former Derry camogie manager, who won back to back Ulster titles with the countys hurlers, feels the GAA should pull the pin on the season. “For the sake of five games, they should have forgot about it and started again in January. For us in Banagher, we did everything according to plan and it takes a lot of effort to go through with the procedures. “For us, there is just not enough gain. If I wasnt the manager, I would be nowhere near it. Someone at a higher level shouldve made the decision to call off the season.” Grab this weeks County Derry Post for previews of this weekends hurling games. RELATEDThis weeks fixtures.

In a statement, they said: Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. At present anyone who tests positive for COVID- in Northern Ireland will be contacted by the contact tracing team to be given advice on what to do about managing symptoms and of the need to self-isolate to prevent any wider spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push They will also be asked who they have been in contact with so that we can follow up with those iniduals to give them advice to help prevent the further spread of infection. Contact tracing is an established method to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-, and we are using this approach to target potential clusters which could spark new outbreaks. Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important. We must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Three Mid Ulster District Council arts facilities will be lit up this weekend in recognition of the district’s frontline workers’ efforts during the Covid- pandemic. The Bridewell, Magherafelt, Ranfurly House, Dungannon and The Burnavon in Cookstown will light up red and white, the council colours, over the weekend. It comes after a motion, proposed by Deputy Chair, Meta Graham, at the council’s monthly meeting, received unanimous support. Cllr Graham wanted to publicly convey the council’s thanks to the workers who worked tirelessly outside the spotlight during the pandemic. “We all clapped deservedly week after week for our remarkable and brave NHS to show our support and to thank them for the sacrices they made during this dficult time,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “However, I think our thanks and appreciation need to be extended further to include all of those who are sometimes overlooked and quite often taken for granted. “We all need to pause and remember that while we may not have had everything we wanted during this crisis, thanks to the work of these dedicated workers, we certainly had everything we needed. “This gesture is a small token of our gratitude, appreciation and thanks to all those who have so selflessly kept Mid Ulster going over the last  months, often at considerable risk to themselves. We owe you all a great debt.” googletag.cmd.push Farmers, factory workers, delivery drivers, lorry drivers, postal workers, retail workers, the PSNI, the NIFRS, small local shops, council staff, volunteers and community groups were among those included by Cllr Graham.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for the club confirmed the news last night after a day of uncertainly regarding the potential fixture. Originally scheduled to face League of Ireland champions Dundalk, Celtic were expecting to welcome the Lilywhites to Celtic Park, but quarantine restrictions ended their hopes of playing the game with anyone coming into the Republic from the UK having to self isolate for  days. With the League of Ireland set to start next Friday, that would have been impossible for the champions. googletag.cmd.push That opened the door for Derry City to step into the glamour friendly, with reports suggesting that former Celtic and City star Paddy McCourt was heavily involved in organising the game. The hope was that, as Derry City would only be travelling to another part of the UK from Northern Ireland, they are not bound by the same restrictions. That hope continued into yesterday, with the club hoping to finalise arrangements for the game, but they were dashed by the FAI last night. With City set to travel to Dublin to face St. Patricks Athletic, just eight days after the proposed game in Scotland, the same -day rule which scuppered Dundalks plans, also appear to have stopped Derry, despite technically being in the UK. googletag.cmd.push Instead of Celtic, City hope to finalise their pre-season plans with a game against Northwest neighbours Finn Harps behind closed doors at the Brandywell tomorrow night. Declan Devines men faced Cltonville in midweek and drew -, with the City boss running his eye over three new trialists. The Candystyripes face Sligo Rovers in the resumption of the league season next Friday. Celtic, meanwhile, who now wont have Irish opposition this weekend, finished off their mini tour of France with a - defeat at French giants Paris St-German, with superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both on the scoresheet in the Parc des Princes encounter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.Politicians are keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take the lead and ensure that a high class leisure community facility, which has been talked about in the resort for decades, is finally delivered.They insist that the provision of modern accommodation in the heart of Newcastle is long overdue and that the lsquoonce in a generationrsquo opportunity to deliver a modern, indoor facility must not be squandered.Some politicians say it is also critical to maximise every available square inch of space at the site to deliver a high quality centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11439390.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added: \"Everyone has a responsibility in keeping themselves and others safe until this pandemic is over.\"We do not know when that happen, but it certainly will not be in the short-term.\"Until then, take

I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable.

A youth Assembly is a fantastic setting to encourage debate and allow our young people to opportunity to hold their elected representatives to account. They must not be weary of pursuing their own agenda and really making their mark on the issues that matter to them.“Over the coming two year period the Alliance Party is looking forward to engaging further with the Youth Assembly and we hope to see an inclusive body, reflective of our society today.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
